" Am I being referred? For a bit of context, I have graduated three months ago, and I am searching for a job for the past month or so.Today I had a casual chat with a guy I know from a couple of projects in school, he is the head of the department at the company I definitely see myself working at, and the chats with him are very casual and laid back, talking about my thesis and recent project he is dealing with at the moment. At the end of the conversation, he said that they are currently wrapping up a lot of projects so they are not hiring, but it might change soon and that I should upload my CV and everything required on to their hiring website.Now, there is a question in the form that I am just filling in on that website that asks if I am referred by one of the employees. Can I consider his invitation to upload my profile to be a referral?I have had some really good conversations with this guy and I think I left a fairly good impression, so naturally, I don't want to mess it up by doing this the wrong way...Thank you all in advance!",0

"Need advice and do I have a case? So I'm a 31 M Hispanic I recently put in my 2 weeks at a fast food restaurant, I decided to go back but I was told I was non rehirable.

"Won't release medical records, board complaint not going anywhere, what now? The General Practioner's office that I was going to up until recently 100% stopped fufilling any and all requests for records (specialists and my case worker), referrals, prior authorizations, refills, forms, etc.This was with recent visits and discussing these things with the doctor there.The office manager has hung up on me, complained to me about people trying to obtain my records, put down the phone and just walked away, told a specialist they won't do a form bc I haven't been seen in a year (I was seen a few months prior in person for vaccines, and even more recently in telehealth), and other bizarre behavior.There's no way to get past her, bc she's usually the one who picks up the phone and mans the front desk. I don't think it's possible that the doctors can be unaware.I've also been charged a missed appointment fee when I was scheduled for an appointment and the time came and went, with no link to do the appointment.I was finally able to get someone on the phone a few hours later, and the office manager was yelling hysterically at me that the appointment was in person.A. No one bothered to tell me that. B. This is when they were only doing emergency appointments in person, and everything else was telehealth. This appointment was not for any emergency.So there's plenty more to this, but point being that no one can get my records so I can even move on. I now see a new general practitioner, and it's really creating a lot of issues bc no one knows what I've had done before and other relevant information.I'm disabled with complex medical issues, so it's kind of a big deal and preventing care. I can't even get my disability plan of service updated for the county.So I filed a complaint with the state's board of physicians over two months ago, and no one I put on the complaint as witnesses has been contacted. Nothing has happened yet.",1
"Starting an Employee resource Group (ERG) at a Small Company?  Hello, I am not in HR, but I would like to help with the diversity,equity,and inclusion initiative at an organization I just joined. I used to work for a large company who had an employee resource group (ERG) for every category you could imagine (LGBTQ+, women, etc), but the organization I have joined has just a little over 100 employees, so I understand that's not entirely feasible here. I can see that they seem a little lost on how to promote diversity&inclusion, and they don't really seem to have anything in place, but a blurb on the monthly newsletter if it's black history month, for example. There's not anything for me to ""join"" really.From talking with other minorities in the company, I can tell they are also unhappy with the lack of support/action. It seems that the company went on a diversity hire spree, but once we became employees, there was not really anything for us. I would really like to provide some insight, but unsure where to start. There is one HR lady who runs the initiative, so I don't want to step on any toes, especially as a new hire.Any tips on how to start/organize an ERG for a small company or how to bring up my ideas to my superiors?",0
" Are there still some ways to negotiate salary after accepting the job offer?   Recently, I accepted the job offer that my new employer sent to me.During the time that I was negotiating for my salary, they didn't give me the salary that I asked for because they told me that my years of experience and ""my great potential during the interview"" (as they said) were not much relevant to the skills and experience of what my new work needs (which makes a great point). They also said that they still need to invest in my training to tailor fit me into my new role in the organization, and believed that the package they offered to me is a representation of what they think is fair based on my experience.I accepted the job offer since their reason is fair enough, and their offer is way better than what I am currently earning.Then, days after accepting the job offer, I remembered about my License (as a Mechanical Engineer) and thought about using it as another means of negotiating for my salary.I don't want to have a bad impression on the company as I may have a higher chance of starting to look like a liability to them, but are there still some ways to negotiate salary after accepting the job offer? After all, we want to have the most of the opportunity given to us.PS.

"My employer denied me a pay raise. To start off, I appreciate any replies back on this post and what to do about being denied a pay raise and sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile.A little back story about my current job, I work with people with disabilities and I’ve been with my current company for about 4 years. My company has a employee evaluation that happens every 6 months and these determine if you get a raise and you’re able to get up to 50 cents depending on your eval. I was at the old pay cap and when it came time for raises this last go around about 6 months ago, I was denied my entire pay raise even though I had a phenomenal eval from my manager. I had 2 staff/coworkers who had been with the company barely 6 months and did less than I did and they got the full raise. I went and talked to my local HR rep about the pay raise and I was told “It wouldn’t be fair for other employees if you got moved from one pay cap to another pay cap and that it would provide me with zero incentive to continue working.” This HR rep knew that I had been with the company for the almost 4 years at the time and had been performing the job tasks of an assistant manager and at one point manager due to losing a manager because of a incident that happened with him and a patient. I didn’t apply for manager at this time because a patient of mine was extremely difficult to work with and caused extreme amounts of anxiety and stress when on shift and he had managed to scare off numerous veteran staff and managers. I helped transition over my patients I had been helping manage to my new manager and then quickly became his right hand man because of my good rapport with the patients and me knowing how everything had ran at the house and was self sufficient. Fast forward a few months and it came pay raise time and I got the shaft on it considering all the work and effort I’ve put in.I don’t know if what they did was illegal to deny my pay raise given what I was told or what? The only reason I haven’t tried to jump heads and talk to someone hire up in corporate is I’m afraid of retaliation happening. I have talked to my managers boss that is very honest and upfront about things and doesn’t hold anything against the staff. He’s had a few reports of a few staff that had the same thing happen even though they had been performing more than expected job duties and he has tried to even make something work with upper management. Would it be best to jump heads to corporate HR or wait until I leave this company in the next year and then alert corporate of what has been going on or even talk to a lawyer about it.TLDR: Worked my ass off and dealt with some really hard individuals and had done more job duties than what my job description says and when it came time for pay raises I got fucked and then told to go basically go fuck my self by my local HR rep when asked about the pay raise. What course of action should I take?",1

But the people I know only speak French.I was asked to speak 500 phrases in English and record them.

I asked the two persons I know who do speak English (MIL and 1 BIL) but they weren't interested. Their absolute right to refuse.I was pushed to find someone else. Who didn't have to be proficient in English. Just able to pronounce the sentences. I asked a tried to find someone. My mother agreed but she couldn't pronounce anything in English. Only in French.

" Recruiter asks for immigration documents upon hire and interview with hiring manager Hi there, I was reached out by recruiter from a fortune 500 pharmaceutical company.

I had $20 in cash that I kept in the center console to give to local homeless people, but that was the only thing taken.Because of this (and a different theft, where my electric scooter was stolen) my partner and I decided to move. Because of the timing of the move, we incurred a lot of extra fees.I guess I’m just curious how much would be ‘normal’ to ask as far as restitution.

"How to use my states Implied Warranty Law? I purchased a TV from Best Buy that the power supply has failed on. The purchase was November 2019.

After some arguing and over an hour on the phone with Best Buy they agreed they have to repair it, but refused because of Covid.

 Protected Veteran Terminated I moved over 5 hours for my job at a private school to be fired for my “demeanor.” I was there for three weeks. I requested a pay stub and tax information and my boss said I wasn’t there long enough to receive that. Also I was supposed to be provided with a contract and background check on my first day which I never received. My boss was terrible she questioned everything I did and only brought up all my mistakes I was making. I advocated for myself requesting more training time and tried to explain I didn’t know I was making mistakes because of the lack of onboarding. Some days I worked without a lunch during a 8 hr shift. I was given no onboarding or training with the school but was expected to know everything. I am so saddened by the situation. I have mental health disabilities that I feel like contributed to my demeanor being questionable. I still don’t know what exactly about my demeanor was wrong. I wore scrubs. My personality is direct and client centered.I was an OTA working with kids with autism. Most of my time was spent was with the kids. I didn’t have enough time to interact with any teachers.

Never received sent an email and boss said she would mail it out. Two weeks later no check. I went into the school to speak with boss. She had the check sitting on her desk. I don’t know if the amount is correct or if taxes where taken out. She did not want to talk to me and was very short.

"How do search warrants work? I’ve tried to do my own research, but I can’t find a specific conclusive answer.My question is this:If evidence of a crime (unrelated to the reason for a specific search warrant) is found during the execution of said search warrant, can that be used as evidence in support of additional charges?Say the police or feds search someone’s home for evidence specifically regarding an embezzlement investigation, and in the search they find 5 pounds of marijuana (which happens to be illegal in that state).What happens?  Does the suspect get charged with both crimes, if sufficient evidence was found for both crimes?  If no evidence was found for the original investigation, will they still be charged with the drug crime?For some reason I think that any admissible evidence obtained during a search warrant has to be related to the scope of the suspected crime stated in the warrant.

"Housing subdivision restrictions. No HOA exists, developer dissolved. Who can enforce restrictions? I live in a small housing subdivision (11 lots). When the subdivision was initially developed (1997), the developer recorded subdivision restrictions with the county register of deeds. The restrictions are pretty thorough and well written. The restrictions state that they will be valid for 50 years and that after 50 years, a 75% vote from residents could be used to amend/change the restrictions. The developer has since dissolved and is no longer in operation, and an HOA was never created.The problem is that one of the land owners has utilized a vacant lot to cut in a driveway solely to access another piece of property in another subdivision. This has created a substantial increase in vehicle traffic and noise on what was previously a quiet dead end road.The subdivision restrictions contain the following relevant restrictions:No lot shall be used except for residential purposes.No property is to be used to access another property.Enforcement shall be by proceedings at law or in equity against the violator.Failure of the developer or any resident to enforce any restriction shall in no way be deemed a waiver of the right to do so.",1

This is a complicated and messy situation, but I will try to be as succinct as possible.To put a long story short, my brother is a drug addict, a sociopath (I'm not exaggerating), an abuser, and a thief. He has destroyed my mother's finances and we are now digging out of it.A couple of years before my dad passed away, a little over a year ago, my brother convinced my parents to let him move in. In almost no time, he was stealing from them left and right and ruining their shit. They did manage to kick him out eventually, but after my Dad died, my mother ""let"" him move back in. I put ""let"" in quotes because my mother was grieving and he is an evil, manipulative abuser and for all I know he showed up and said ""I'm not leaving.""After 9 months we finally had him removed with a court order after the abuse escalated to physical as well as the emotional and financial abuse. I took her out of state to live with me and we put her house on the market. Its under contract now and in less than two weeks time, she'll have about 100k to bank (319k minus reverse mortgage payoff minus 90k condo purchase).My mother's bank accounts have been closed for awhile (to keep his hands off her money) and she has been putting her SS and Reverse Mortgage checks into my bank account and paying her bills from there. Today she tried to deposit the reverse mortgage and my credit union said (for the first time in months) ""No, we don't do 3rd party checks"". So I tried to add her to my account as an authorized user and after trying to do so we learned she can't open an account or be added to an account because of monies owed to various banks. Basically, we realized my brother has been writing bad checks on her old accounts.I appreciate you if you have read this far.So the crux of my question is this: I want to contact a professional to help her dig out of this. I need some combination of an identity fraud expert/lawyer and a credit counselor. My mother has never dealt with finances in her entire life because my father always took care of things.I just want to get her stable and her credit in order. I don't want her to have to pay for legitimate fraud and identity theft and I also don't want creditors coming after her now that she is about to have a payout.A couple of notes:",1

"Futures Contracts: Am I An Idiot? Ok, I have a dumb question.So I'm looking at this website at the price of gold futures. The market price for these futures says 1723. Okay, does that mean I can buy 1 contract for $1723?But the contract is 100oz of gold, not 1oz. So would I actually have to pay $172,300 to get this contract? I assume not, because when the contract expires that would mean I have the obligation to pay another $172,300ish to buy the physical gold.OR: If one contract only costs $1723, and I buy it, come expiration day does this mean I would have to pay whatever the spot price is for 100oz of gold? Or would I have to pay 100x the price of whatever the market price of the contract is at expiration? Or would they go back and look at what I originally bought it for, and I'd have the obligation to buy the gold at 100x the price of $1723?Holy fuck I'm so confused.",2
"Help with IRR Model with upfront cash I am trying to build an IRR model where an investor gives us $6M in yr 1 upfront for a build to suit building and then begins charging us $5.3M (with 2.5% ann increase) in rent for the next 5 years starting in yr 2.

"I was kicked out of a band after two years of gigs in which each band member chose to give their gig earnings to make a record that I am no longer a part of. Now they want to deny me any compensation for all the time worked. After my day in the studio the band decided to let me go. From the start of our journey we had a meeting to decide that all of our earnings from gigs would go to making a record. We finally made our goal and went into the studio where out of nowhere, they felt I wasnt the right fit and simply cited creative differences.Of course, not thinking about a possible fallout, on top of being happy of being part of the group and music itself, I never thought this would need a written  agreement, so no written contract exists.However, the time spent and agreement of each band member lending their efforts to earn money for the band in order to fund their part in the recordings, I can only think compensating me for my portion of earnings is simply the ethical, and hopefully legal thing to do, now that I’m removed against my will from the band. We’ve also run on the concept of buying out band members for things such as equipment purchased should they leave the band.I may be ignorant in definitive definitions of the law, but I can’t help but feel using the money I was essential in helping the band earn for the record as a partnership, in which my work for the band was contingent on my participation on the record, is edging on the grounds of embezzlement. Also the fact that the band leader mentioned this was bad timing and this has been a thought of theirs to get rid of me for some time, makes me feel like it’s fraud for misleading me and waiting until a deposit was able to be made to fire me and use my 1/6th share to pay for a producer they could’ve never afforded without me.Do I have any legal recourse to demand those earnings back or is this an unethical but unenforceable thing?Thanks for any perspective everybody.",1

Cashiers keeping Customer Receipts Some of my cashier coworkers keep receipts that customers don't want (or even print duplicate receipts from previous orders) to scan with an app to get money. This seems very sketchy to me and it turns me the wrong way (mainly because these receipts have customers' card information on them). It gets to be to the point where I am noticing the cashiers pocket the receipts from every single customer and their pockets are bulging with receipts. Is this legal? Would this be considered stealing? Or am I worrying about nothing?,1

"I’m conflicted on what would ultimately be more helpful. I currently live in LA county CA and I have an opportunity to increase the minimum pay at my job to a living wage vs a minimum wage.  The thing that’s been bothering me is the overall impact that it might have on the economy. With the increase to wage though the plan I set up there’s a potential for an price inflation bubble that could potentially be catastrophic as a result. With the increase in pay comes an increase in spending, with an increase in spending comes an increase in price. So my question is :With that potentiality in mind would it be better to provide my fellow employees with a living wage and risk the change of mass inflation or do I do nothing and allow them to suffer in relative poverty?",2

" Should I 3 Step and Employee or Lay-Off w severance pay? Hi all,Small tech business of 20 people. I hired a software developer about 8 months ago. We run a pretty informal ship - I dont care where, when, or even particularly how many hours salaried employees work per week - just the results.Long story the new developer is very pleasant and eager but also isnt as skilled as I need and isnt thriving in our results orientated culture. I am the owner not his direct supervisor. His manager failed at addressing the issues early and he has not had any constructive feedback. I am dealing w manager failure separately but that still leaves me with an employee without the right skills.Now I am looking at the slowing economy and the fact he is both my worst performing staff member as well as the 3rd most expensive (soft dev market is what it is). I would rather save costs and pay a better bonus to my other great staff for Christmas than keep paying him.I normally have a rule that a firing should never be a suprise but this one stumps me. I know we made a bad hire and he just isnt the right person for us. I dont have another position for him either.Is it kinder to just call him in and lay him off with a generous severance (1 month pay for only 7 months w us).Or should i try and put him on a warning period and see if he can try to improve his output. I really dont think he can get his output to where we need it fast enough though.",0
" Virginia, US - Being paid for two weeks after two have passed since said two weeks. Virginia, US Thanks to all who read this!To start off, I don’t like confrontation and I got this job through a friend so I’m hoping this is a benign issue.I began working at this computer store a few months ago and we do bi-weekly pay, which I’m used to so I wasn’t thinking too much about it at the time.The issue arises when I’ve come to realize that pretty much every pay I get is actually the pay for the two weeks I worked preceding the two weeks that have come to an end. This might be normal, but in my experience I’ve always been paid for each two weeks AS they finish not as the next one does.That aside, I’ve already had to come to my boss with bank statements and statements from our timesheet app to show him that he’s missed pay for pay periods on TWO separate occasions. He apologized and commented that he called the timesheet app’s support line to figure out why this has happened, but that’s all I know that he has done.I work alone and the only other individual who works in my dept.** hasn’t said anything to me about it, and even if he did, he been friends with the owner for a long time it seems.TL;DR - I am getting my two-weeks worth of pay two weeks after said two weeks is completed and I wanna know if that is fine or if I should be doing something? It is irksome especially since I find myself in need of money so often.** (dept. in this instance meaning my boss owns and has stake in multiple companies that he oversees IT wise but I work in the IT company he actually owns)",0

"Self Evaluation: Do I make it “HR official/on record” or just between my boss and I?  Hi. I’ve been at my role for about 3 months and have to hand in my self evaluation soon. My boss/department head told us we had the “option for it to be official, so HR can see our self evaluation or unofficial”, the latter of which would mean it’s just between ourselves and our boss. Our boss of course also does an employee evaluation, which I would assume goes on our HR record? (But I also don’t know?)What is the benefit for having a self evaluation be on the record? And if an employee opts for this, is it possible a manager may take it the wrong way somehow?I have a reasonably good relationship with my boss, and though I am still learning (and a little wobbly), I can’t imagine I have major cause for concern about my employee evaluation, given the feedback so far has been mostly positive aside from constructive criticism as I’ve been learning.. which I think is to be expected.I would like to eventually (like 1-2 years from now) get promoted to the level above my currently position, but again, I wouldn’t know if that means I should be making these reviews “on record”, given my boss is fairly senior anyway, and would be the one to make that call.",0
"This is to do with copyright law maybe even patent law. So I saw lately a lot of disappointment in video games this year not living up to expectations due to game play, graphic, glitches and what ever else.I don't doubt that most or ""all"" have the actual intention of improving their game fixing the issues but there seems to be a ""understanding"" that most will try but some will put out a disappointing game and move on.Here is my question;If I take a video game and ""improve it"" over the original, how much of an improvement would there need to be to be able to call the new version mine and hold all rights to it?I base this thought on the facts that IF I take a patent and improve on it enough, it doesn't even need to be a full redesign just gain of function and not even significant, you get to file a new patent, you don't own the original but you do have the right to the new one.This applies to art as well especially in the modern digital age, the famous example being Obamas picture in the HOPE poster, it was based on a real picture someone took and someone else transformed it enough to be able to claim it as their own work.Would I be able to make this type of argument in court and win slim margin even?",1
"Company locker battle  I’m having a problem with a rule oriented manager.At my job we are required to use lockers with a combination lock. I have a condition where my hands shake.

I also have documented adhd, I am neurodivergent to say the least. The combination lock takes me at least 10 tries because I sometimes shake without knowing the degree I turned it. This is very frustrating to me. What is more frustrating is I don’t have a formal diagnosis and I would have divulge medical history that would be hard to document but also draining emotionally. I opted to see if I skate by not using it.I decided to not use my locker and my manager confronted me about it. So I obliged her concern by not bringing any personal items in that couldn’t fit on my person. I still use the locker to keep my headset but that’s all. It is empty otherwise. I keep it unlocked so I don’t have to waste unpaid time trying to fight with the locker. Recently my manager has been going out of her way to lock my locker during my shift. Today it happened for the 3rd time this week alone and I snapped. I told my manager I’ll no longer need the locker and to feel free to give it to a new hire.I plan now to keep the headset in my car.

I worked 40 hr weeks and get paid weekly in bay area CA.Last day of employment I got a call from HR for formality sakes. The usual you'll get your last pay direct deposited, benefits end dates and so on.I only received a pay check for prior week of pay and accumulated PTO.

Now I have to wait until the following Friday.They have confirmed that I would be paid on the 28th for my 40 hrs I was missing. I know in California there is the waiting penalty for employer who fails to pay out all wages in 72 hours of termination.

"Alteration to NYC Rent Stabilized Apartment We have an old brick wall in our rent-stabilized unit that is shedding dust. It is a beautiful wall and we don't want to change it, but my partner has asthma and it sheds dust on our furniture. We already have a plug-in air filter that we placed near the wall, but I think sealing the brick would help. The wall is not crumbling apart. It is a typical 100+ year-old brick wall that was exposed for aesthetic reasons on one side of our living room.Question: will this type of alteration put us at greater risk of a rent increase? I am guessing this could possibly qualify as an individual apartment improvement (IAI), which is a popular loophole for rent increases. It says the work must be done by a licensed contractor. Maybe if I offer to pay for the supplies and do it myself that would help get around this? Our landlord could always reject the alteration request or insist that we not do the work ourselves and have one of his staff do it instead. I found a product by Radon called LastiSeal Brick & Masonry Sealer that costs less than $100 and am comfortable doing the work myself if he grants permission.

"questions about legal validity in a documentary If this isn't the right place to post this please refer me to a more appropriate place.  However, I think this works.  I was watching a documentary about Shanann Watts, which happened in Colorado.  At some point after Shanann didn't respond to her friend's texts the friend called the police to check on her.  The cop who showed up didn't seem particularly interested in accessing the house despite an overwhelming lot of suspicious circumstance.  He defaulted back to 'only being able to enter the house with the husband's permission' - which didn't make sense to me, not completely, as it was Shanann's house. I was hoping someone could explain to me why this cop wouldn't investigate the home when everyone around him was saying the circumstances were off- like when the neighbors confirmed Chris Watts was acting weird the cop still insisted only Chris could enter the house.  But at that point there's enough circumstancial stuff to give him probable cause, right?  The other question I had is about the polygraph test.

"Why is it legal that airlines don't allow you to resell your ticket? They are breaking the rules of free market, right? They charge you with fines for changing it's name or cancel it, and you need to buy a flight in case you need it on a certain day cause they skyrocket prices when the time is short and they know you NEED it. If we were able tu resell them, flights would have to be cheaper cause you can buy a second hand one. You can say, ""yeah but in this way they avoid people reselling them with profit"", but it's not in favor of the community, they are the ones who keep all the power and increase the prices on their will.When buying a new car, the car factory has to have reasonable prices cause if not you can buy a second hand one, and in the same way it happens with pretty much all products, so, why not?At the same time, everyone can buy a plane ticket, it's not like they check your crime history or if you have a visa for the country you are travelling to.

Just imagine you can eat just one thing (cause you need to go from A to B in a specific moment), that one thing is sold but just one company, and it raises it's price to 1000% when you are low on glucose and you can die, would it be legal??",1
"Flex Healthcare account for childcare? Hi all,




I've always had the ability to put money into flex healthcare since I've been at my job. I've recently changed jobs and the benefits actually explained a bit better that I can use the flex healthcare card for child daycare. This is great because its pretax income applied to the card! I currently pay $264/week for childcare.




Due to financial situations, I can only put $2,500 into the flex healthcare card for my child (wife and I file separately). I currently make $130,000.

Is this a savings at all? Or is it more headache than worth? I know I'll have to manage moving from the flex card to my CC when I max it out after a few months...




I wasn't sure if there was an easy way to figure this out on my own, but I'm certainly willing to learn.

"Is she entitled to half the money under any circumstance? (I am posting this in as many groups in hopes someone can help!)Hi so this is a long shot and I will try to make it short with giving a little bit of back story. Anyways a family member of mine has been together with their partner for 8+ years and thinks they’re married by common law, they’ve lived together the whole time and have brought 2 wonderful girls into the world.The relationship went south a about 4 years in. For the past 3 years the partner (M) has been using drugs like crazy, he suffered with addiction in the past coke,  heroin, opioids, etc. but it is known knowledge and has been known knowledge for about 2 years now and he is admitting it, it was known about coke and opioids, but now heroin as well.Started hiding his money, wouldn’t bring any home putting his partner (F) and the family in constant debt (almost lost they’re house, barely puts food on the table for the kids etc) , as well as of last week stole his 4 year olds daughters preschool money out of her backpack, and is around the kids alone constantly the family is about done with letting this happen, as it’s about safety of the kids now. If (F) wants to do it to herself then fine but when he’s driving the kids and alone with them it’s not okay. (Age 7, and 4)Anyways with a little bit of backstory (F) doesn’t want to leave yet as she thinks when this money comes through in a year she will be entitled to half legally. (M) had a large mod vape in his pocket about 2 years ago and it exploded leaving him with a large burn as well as left the floor charred. So they sued and they/he are for sure getting a minimum of 65,000. He’s already talked about as soon as he gets it he’s going to leave, so (M) will not give any to (F) period let alone continuing addiction as deep as (M’s)  in.It’s really hard to find a straight answer by looking it up but everything I have read states that she will not be entitled to half legally, no matter if they’re married by common law because it is from a personal injury no matter the circumstances including if (F) went after (M) for child support since he would technically have more money they still wouldn’t take that into account because it is from personal injury and technically has nothing to do with her.So I just wanted to hear some lawyers takes on this and if there would even be any legal action she could take if he did not give her any part of it and if it is possible could she still get half if they aren’t together any more. I am just looking for legal advice on this after we figure this out if she doesn’t do something as a family we’ve decided to possibly get cps involved for the kids sake as it’s a huge safety risk and honestly not sure if he will even live the next year like this.Sorry didn’t want to make it too long but still wanted to include the situation and what’s happening if that would change anything. Morally of course she should get half but legally and morally obviously don’t mix or matter.",1

"Call-back hours worked and California overtime laws Please explain call-back pay and accrual of overtime in California.I am having a difficult time finding information on this subject and I would like to learn more about it. I am an RN in California, non-union, non-exempt.  To incentivize RNs to work extra, because they've failed to properly staff the entire hospital and there are not enough nurses to care for all the patients, our employer offered (crisis wages) 2xbase pay for any hours worked above your FTE (regular scheduled shifts). They have failed to pay OT and claim they are not required to. Now I am a 12-hour employee so I wouldn't normally accrue OT until after 12 hours on any given day or after 40 hours in a week.The two scenarios in dispute are:1- an employee comes in 4 hours early for they're shift on the crisis wages. They then work their regular 12 hour shift for a total of 16 hours. The last four hours, hours 13 through 16, should be OT. Admin says no because we were paid double for the first 4 hours. In this case the 4hr crisis shift isn't even an incentive because, under normal circumstances, the nurse would only be entitled to 4 hours of double time anyway. The wage owed in the last 4 hours is in question here.2 - I am scheduled to work my regular 12hr shifts Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I work 3 12hr crisis shifts on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday which I am scheduled in advance for because staffing knows we are already short of nurses for patient care. MTW should be the crisis wage; 4 hours of Fridays shift is straight pay and 36 hours should be OT. Admin is refusing to pay any OT.Management has called these crisis shifts ""call-back"" shifts and are claiming the hours worked do not apply to the OT rules. These are actual hours worked in the hospital, not stand-by.Our unit and several others have never been subject to ""call-back"" rules and we are unfamiliar with what this means. Usually our OR and Cath Lab teams work call-back because it cannot be predicted when someone may need emergency surgery or has a heart attack and needs to go to Cath Lab.I understand that California defines call-back as being related to unforeseen circumstances, such as the above mentioned.Our situation is not an unforeseen emergency. Our management is well aware of short staffing weeks in advance and rather than sending a text a couple hours ahead of shift start that they are needing more staff (which has been usual practice but more unpredictable regarding how many RNs would be available on short notice) they have sent out emails of how many shifts need to be filled at any given time during the week as well as when specialty nurses are needed (for instance I am one of a handful that is part of the ""code blue team"").An OR nurse kind of explained how call-back works and they can literally be working over 24 hours straight but not get OT because call-back hours worked don't count toward accrual of overtime hours.

"Virginia Early Lease Termination Thank you in advance for any advice.My brother and I moved into what we thought was an alright neighborhood. The place was seemingly so good that we signed a two year lease. It turns out that this wasn't the case. On move-in week, we found that the back-facing bedroom window was shot out. We talked to the realtor at this point, but the clause (which I will specifically define) stated that we would be responsible for paying rent/utilities until they found another tenant. Backing out wouldn't be financially viable at that point.We soon realized that a few houses in the neighborhood (townhouses) were 'party houses'. With our house being a corner-house, this turned into music being blasted almost every afternoon and evening from spring break until now. With the walls shaking constantly working at home and trying to go to bed (we've made multiple noise complaints to no avail), we only had the winter to look forward to - figuring that it'd be too cold for people to hang around outside.

" Autistic struggles at work: how to manage the impact of my neurodiversity in my career? I am an Autistic mid-career level manager at a startup company. HR and management are not aware of my neurodiversity nor of my struggles.My role requires that I travel with other team members to attend events, seminars and conferences, among other duties. I have no trouble whatsoever carrying out professional duties expected of someone in my role - I go above and beyond to offer the best possible service and generally obtain positive feedback.During these industry events and travels, however, employees are expected to stick together and participate in all kinds of social events that while not mandatory by any means, appear to be an important part of company and industry culture; like lunch together, dinner together, drinks together, etc. Since local culture puts strong emphasis on personal connections, such events open doors and might act as the primary building blocks of your reputation as a professional (which sometimes outweighs your actual performance on the job - eg. personality can trump skill and output).Largely due to my ASD, I cannot take part in such events, as much as I would like to. I simply have no energy left at the end of a long day at an industry show to do any more socialising off-the-clock, my social fuel being absolutely dry after 8 hours of on-the-clock talking to potential clients. I have tried in the past, but the result was either terrible migraines, skin rashes or a stomach ulcer.

This has caused my team to treat me different, and I know there is gossip and speculation about my personality and lifestyle.

I also fear for my future and career options - whether I am eligible for a promotion, a raise, or even if I can be trusted as someone who acts different from the norm.Is there any advice you all could offer to help me navigate this?

"What can I do about neighbor's animals in my yard? In rural iowa, USA.My neighbors have a nice long history in our small town for being awful animal owners. Most recently, they have been told by the city to get rid of their 3 horses. Having them breaks city ordinances, but because the town is so small and funding minimal, not much has really been done.Neighbors and myself have made police reports about neglect, written letters to the city council, and signed petitions. Because we are their closest neighbor who has reported them, they spent an entire year harassing us and only recently stopped due to yet another police report telling them to stop.They have a young goat and pony they let free range around their yard. The goat regularly comes into our yard and garden. It's a pain. We have returned the goat a handful of times and get yelled and cursed at. The neighbors make a big stink on Facebook and the landlord has requested we ""just drop it"" because they are harassing him, too.Anyway, the goat sittuation is just getting too ridiculous.   It's eating my produce, stressing out my dogs, and has recently started to headbutt with it's horns. We've had enough. Nothing gets done and I'm about one incident away from shooting the damn thing.

" I want to give notice for a period where I already am taking PTO for a family wedding, but PTO can’t be taken during your 2wks at my company I hope to be able to put 2wks in Friday. This job has been pretty toxic and I need out. I’m waiting for everything to be official with the new job before giving notice, but I do want to give a real notice.

My sister’s wedding is coming up. I have PTO from next Wed to the following Mon that has been approved. This has been established time off for me for months. However, in our handbook, no paid leave can be taken during your notice period. The CEO does have the discretion to waive the notice period though

Honestly it’s really important to me to get paid for these days if at all possible. I will lose around 10hr of PTO if I do go to wedding and then give less than 2wks notice as they only pay out if you give a full 2wks. That’s fine, but I don’t want to essentially lose all of the time.

I could also give a full notice on the last day of my pto and work those 2 weeks but it would leave no time before starting the new position and I do need a mental health reset if possible.

I’m not really sure how to proceed. Should I be fully transparent with HR once I’m ready to put in notice and explain the situation? I am happy to work the days on either side of the planned PTO. I do want to give notice and not fuck people over.

But obviously attending the wedding is non negotiable. I’ll just quit and take it unpaid if needed but financially with the increased health insurance expenses and wedding expenses and all of that, having those days paid would help. Could they refuse to pay the PTO if I quit with a short notice after the wedding?

I want a relatively happy solution for everyone but I’m lost here",0

" sexual harassment/ bullying? I am a female and another female coworker of mine has started slowly (in my opinion) bullying me. It started one morning when I sent her a work chat requesting a document that I was missing. She walked over and pulled me out of the meeting that I was in to ask me why I didn’t say good morning and if I was overwhelmed. There has been other occasions where I would be working with someone and she would just come and asked the person to go with her and not even acknowledge my presence or that I was working with that person.Then a good coworker of mine came to me and said she was asking about if him and I had sexual relations and he was very upset because he knows that I am married and wanted to insist that he would never do anything to jeopardize my marriage because he respects me, my marriage and our friendship. I didn’t confront her about it because of how I saw things escalating with her but then one day someone had a concern about my work and mentioned it to her and instead of her calling me over to clarify it or even elevating it to management, she took it upon herself to get a written statement and arrange a one on one meeting with me. The meeting was set for days later and during that time other people were mentioning that she was filing an official report against me, but she has no one of authority and doesn’t have the power to file an official report.When I went to talk about side complaints, she insisted on keeping a written statement and suggested that I follow up with that person for clarity (again not my immediate supervisor to offer me next steps). After she was like well since I have you here can we talk about what’s going on with us because there has never been any conflict between us and I feel like you were acting weird towards me (this is still at work during working hours) I mentioned the way that she pulls me and others out of my meeting without saying anything. And then I mentioned that my coworker mentioned something to me that was quite disturbing so I decided to keep my distance. She started going off and saying that she wanted to fuck that guy I needed to know if he fucked me first because she feel like she saw me have gestures towards him that may indicate that we had a thing. I insisted that she didn’t need to say my name or get me involved she could have just asked if he was with anyone. She kept insisting that if she wanted to “fuck him“she needed to know if he was fucking me first.It’s all conversation made me uncomfortable and I ended up leaving. Later she sent me a message saying that she didn’t like the way things ended but since we are still on the same team we have to make sure and still act professional towards each other. I responded that we are not on the same team if she went out of her way to get a written statement about me (not standard from coworker to coworker). She then sent me like a seven page long text message about how I am creating an issue out of nothing and I am playing a victim and I have been avoiding her and the team for a while now and is creating a hostile environment for myself and others. I ended up writing an email to my direct supervisor asking if we can limit the amount of time that her and I work together.I was just curious if this is considered bullying/harassment and also are the conversations that she had with my coworker considered sexual harassment? I can’t see it appropriate for her to think that it’s OK to ask if I am “fucking “a coworker and justify it because she wanted to make sure that I didn’t sleep with him first.",0
Short Term Disability. Was told my mat leave would qualify but now I’m not sure since my last period was 2 months before I started?  I started with my company in April. I’m in GA company is in PA.

" Just signed a job offer letter! Questions of NYC background checks for new employees Hi everyone. I recently accepted a new job offer that will almost double my existing salary. I'm super excited and optimistic for me and my family's future.That said, the contract states that the offer is conditional upon references (not worried), signing an NDA (sure) and a background check. The last one I'm worried about. My job history and education are all accurate or as close to accurate as it can be. No criminal records, lawsuits, tax related issues or anything of that sort. I am however sitting on a lot of debt and unpaid bills over the last few months due to unforeseen expenses over 2022. My credit dipped significantly. But I read that NYC has made it illegal for employers to discriminate upon credit scores, and they might not even be allowed to check. Is this true? Are there workarounds for them to still check your score and disqualify you for some other random reason?To confirm, my job is not related to city/federal govt, I am not in charge of company finances/equities, and the employer is a growing startup (maybe they're more relaxed?). I will be working in IT. The background check will be through Sterling, which I understand is more geared towards employment verification, but can they also run credit checks?I'm 95% sure my offer letter wont be revoked despite my credit and I'm certain it won't be checked and/or used to discriminate but I just wanted to be absolutely sure. Otherwise it would really suck for me to lose a job opportunity and chance to no longer be poor due to currently being poor lol.",0

"Attendance policy legal question  A company is in the process of changing its Covid policy. Here is some relevant info:The attendance policy is no-fault, as in points accrue regardless of doctor visits vs just staying home on one's own assessment of illness.The Covid policy remains that the company's HR team is telling a worker who tests positive for Covid that they must stay away for 5 calendar days after their positive test.Until now, there was a Covid exception to our point system, specifically a Covid diagnosis did NOT accrue points. No documentation was needed, just the employee's word.Under the new policy, Covid absences are pointed unless the employee gets FMLA paperwork from their doctor.My questions are:If the company MANDATES the 5-days-away policy, can it also write up the employee for attendance violations based on those points accruing? Would this run afoul of any labor protections or laws?Does the policy create a motivation for an employee to lie? For example, if a worker calls out with the flu, they can return to work within 24 hours of symptoms going away. So a worker with no PTO hours left has a financial motivation to hide a Covid diagnosis.Thanks!",0

"Corporate Finance: Credit and Inventory Management Senior Year in College. Taking Advanced Corporate Finance and reading chapter of credit policy (the aspects of extending credit to business customers). It's a weird topic (or at least it's explained poorly by the textbook), but essentially, here's a scenario that describes my confusion: A company makes an order for $1000 and is granted credit by the seller with terms 2/10 net 30. The book says that the effective credit period is 20 days (since the 10-day discount period is basically ""free credit), and the cost to the buyer of not taking advantage of the discount is equal to $20/$980 ($980 in the denominator because the book explains that the credit is essentially a loan for $980 and the interest is basically the foregone discount of $20--it's a weird way of thinking since it's kind of altering reality, but im going along with it).Now, the confusion lies in calculating the ANNUAL cost to the buyer of foregoing the discount. The book says that there are 365/20=18.25 such periods (referring to the credit period and effectively assuming a repetitive buying process throughout the year), so we have to compound the per-period interest rate of 20/980 to arrive at the effective annual rate of   - 1 = 44.59%.Now, I understand compounding and effective rates when it refers to compounding interest rates on an investment (for example, invest $1000 and get 2% a month with monthly compounding...what is the effective annual rate? bla bla bla), but why are we compounding the per period rate in this case (meaning, in the case of missing out on a monthly credit discount?). Because... in my thoughts, the book is assuming that there are 18.25 order during the year of (based on the ""loan story""...) $980 and we pay $20 of interest each time. So isnt the effective annual rate just ($20 x 18.25)/($980 x 18.25), which is just equal to the per-period rate (=$20/$980)?",2

"Is there any recourse in cases of abusive reporting to social-services protective agencies? My brother works in social services, which for this discussion means that he knows some tricks.He has wanted Mom out of her house since Dad died, which (in my opinion) is context for all of his actions relevant here. ""John"" has no special position of authority or responsibility and contributes nothing to Mom's well-being. (The power of attorney was stripped from him several years ago because he was behaving erratically and irresponsibly.)Last summer, he filed a report with Department of Human Services against me, her de facto caregiver living on-property. The caseworker's visit found his claims to be without merit. But there were no consequences. There are no consequences for false reporting to DHS.Today Mom is in hospital - hip fracture and replacement. The injury happened mysteriously, in the kitchen on a flat, non-slip surface where I found her and cared for her in consultation with her doctor's team before calling EMT's on their advice.Now, ""somebody"" has filed a report against me with Adult Protective Services. The hospitalist refers to this as a matter that ""muddies"" the issue of her immediate future, but believes we'll get through this okay.My question is: what can I do about gratuitous reporting? Is there anything, or nothing I can even do? Is there any recourse? Conversely, what might I best not do. I'm restraining myself from any exuberant expressions of emotion, and certainly not making any accusations.I'm in the depth of my heart hoping to get Mom home and that's my only real priority now.

" Company wants to add On-Call to my position and not pay for the hours I am making myself available for being on-call. How do I say No and keep my job? UPDATED in comments:I am a salaried software support analyst. I came into the position with no experience and I’ve already been asked to start training for a Professional Services position for when I becomes available in the next year. Our team is very small (less than 10) and the company is only five years old. I am at the level of the other support analyst who has been with the company for four years.  In addition to our 40 to 44 hours per week, we alternate one Saturday coverage every three weeks, 8am-12pm from home, only for P1 level tickets. We get a set amount regardless of whether there is a priority call or not. We do not have to work past noon.Last week they informed us that we will be doing after hours coverage through 4 AM in the morning on-call, 7 days in a row every other week. We only get paid if there is P1 ticket.Essentially I will not get paid unless there is a ticket and I will have to sit around the house and be available for a ticket in order to respond in less than 15 minutes.Their argument is that it won’t put us over 45+ hours because there will be very few tickets so we shouldn’t be negatively affected at all.My argument is that I should be paid to make myself available so that I can respond in 15 minutes or less. And that I will have to change my private life to accommodate this new responsibility. I will get virtually no Compensation for this.Additionally I feel it will change our customer’s behavior. I am the only one that is available till 5 PM in our time zone. Which means the customers will now push to get all of their tickets in before the end of the business day and I will have to take all of those and then work more hours because if the ticket is in before 5 PM I don’t get any extra compensation.I asked if I could have a three month trial on this new program and if I didn’t like it would I be able to opt out. They said no. I asked if this is optional at all and my supervisor said that we “may” not have a choice. I replied that I always have a choice, I don’t have to work here.They have not officially implemented this program and I’m really stressed out about the situation.

It's paid fully by them and is not part of NJ FLI or any other employer  programs.I submitted a request  for this benefit through my employer prior to the birth of my child, and  I was only required to provide proof of birth for the leave request to  be approved, which I did. So fast forward to my next pay statement which  covers the time included in this leave request, and I see that my  employer made a deduction for 'state disability offset.'I  called up the team that handles leaves requests and they said they  couldn't help me and that I'd have to speak with payroll. Payroll says  nothing other than 'I have to claim the benefits.' (our payroll team is  outsourced and probably doesn't know any more than that.)I  called the leave team again and then tell me that I have to fill out NJ  FLI to collect. Not knowing any better I went and applied for FLI.  Shortly after this my manager reached out to our assigned HR rep to ask  why my employer didn't pay 100% and he responds ""HR has fixed the  issue."" I assumed that this was the end of the confusion. My pay was  fixed when he said it would.Today  I received a debit card in the mail from the state because my FLI  benefits were still approved and paid out. So now I was paid by my  employer and NJ. My understanding is that NJ does not pay FLI benefits  if you were paid by your employer during this time frame. My manager  reached out to our HR contact who stated that my employer will not do  anything and that it is up to me to resolve this with the state.So  my issue / question is around this; at this point in time my employer  is not going to garnish my paycheck or take back the money they paid,  even though I'm in this situation because of their mistake. What is the  worst case if the state will not reclaim the benefits paid out to me,  and my employer won't take back the money they paid me? I don't want the  state benefits, and getting a hold of someone who can help has so far  been unsuccessful. I'm going to continue trying to contact the state by  phone in the meantime. I also filed an appeal with the state asking to  revoke the claim eligibility but have no idea how long that will take,  and I had planned on using FLI in December but can't because this claim  is still open.Thanks!",0
"My health insurance company called a family member (I am an independent adult, I don’t even know how they got their number) to get me to download an app See title.A week ago, I got a phone call at work. It was from a nurse at my health insurance company, asking me a bunch of questions relating to my mental health and asking if I’m doing all right and that they were concerned due to a recent “crisis”.I was confused as hell, since while I’m seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist for depression and anxiety, I have not expressed suicidal thoughts, hearing voices, etc. to either or them, or any of my doctors, nor have I expressed such sentiments or experiences recently elsewhere. The nurse went on to say that I could download an app for mental health support and said she’d be checking up on me in a week.I was so confused that I ended up calling my roommate immediately after I hung up, just to ask him if he’d made some bogus report on me somewhere, or something. I was really grasping at straws. Then while I was on the phone with him, I received a text message from my dad, telling me that I needed to call the insurance company.They’d called him trying to get ahold of me after I’d talked to them. I have never given my insurance company his contact number information. I never would - if I needed to provide an emergency contact, my roommate would be first, my mom second, my dad maybe fourth or fifth. They’d have to get his number from maybe one of my doctors, when I’d give him as an emergency contact there perhaps, way down the line, or, jeez, I dunno.They called again yesterday while I was at work to “check up on me”. The app, blah blah blah. I asked point-blank, precisely what is this all about? What inspired the first call in the first place? And the nurse pretty much refused to answer my question. The first call, she mentioned an unspecified “crisis”; the second, she explains “Well, we just have these resources available……” Like no I wanna know why you’re calling me. Why you called my parent.This whole thing makes me incredibly uncomfortable. The fact that they called me out of the blue for no reason, referencing a “crisis” they they won’t give me details about (and apparently didn’t happen by the time they made their second call); that they contacted a family member that I did not give them permission to contact for a non-emergency after they had already spoken to me; and the fact that they’re so evasive about their reasoning for all of this just seems wrong. Is it legal? Is it ethical? I get my insurance through work - who do I go to?",1
"I need help with an exercise Hello, everyone! I am teaching  English as a second language for someone who needs it for her career.

Is there a Term to define when a minor turns into an adult and requests for a pay raise to compensate larger living expenses? Hello. I’ve been working a company for 6 years now.

"Voluntary resignation.. is this legal? So, the vaccine mandates have begun and my employer, my local hospital, is being forced to implement it. Failure to comply will result in what they are referring to as “voluntary resignation.”However, that’s just not the truth. Those who refuse vaccination are not wishing to resign at all. They simply want to be able to make the choice for themselves. They are actually being forced to resign for not complying with their mandate but otherwise have no desire to leave their jobs. They are being forced to take the vaccine, or they will lose their jobs.So my question is, is “voluntary resignation” under these circumstances actually legal?",1

"need advice please!  For some background: i interviewed for the job I currently have (HR Generalist) and I was told the salary range then when I was offered the job I was told they told me the wrong thing and it was actually 3k less (I decided to not negotiate or fuss because of the benefits and it being hybrid because I really wanted that perk) and they also told me I’d receive training and Ive received barely any training since I started over two months ago.Also during the interview my now boss told me that they just implemented a remote policy and as long as two people on our team are in the office each day he doesn’t care. So fast forward to a little over two months into the role I asked to start working 2 days from home (the only other person on our 4 person team that does is my boss, the other two people decided not to) and yesterday he told me that new hires actually need to be here for a year before they can but he’ll let me know by thanksgiving what’s going on. Not ideal but okay. Today as he’s walking past my office and he says btw you can starting working from home 1 day a week at your six months, but if you’re working on xyz project you can work from home now. Which honestly makes no sense because what difference does it make? I have zero meetings in person and no one stops by my office for anything because a majority of my work is done on the computer. He told me from day 1 if I’m not happy to tell him so I don’t know if I should just email him twice a week that I’m working on xyz project and wfh like I want to or sit down and tell him I’m not happy because when I interviewed this is what was said and was a major factor in my decision to accept the job. I’m just really disappointed and frustrated because everything they said in the interview seems to of been a lie.Please ignore my terrible writing and grammar etc., it’s been a long day.",0

" How to stop employers knowing about my past. A few years ago I made the unwise decision of being homeless mainly to save money and be less dependant on jobs I disliked, it was supposed to be temporary but a few months turned in to a few years, when on a long unemployed stint I was a witness to a serious incident (which meant I went to hospital for a check up and believe they were told I was homeless but I personally only told the police) which was reported in the papers I avoided reading them but I know they revealed that I was homeless, when I finally got back into work it was obvious that my bosses knew things about me and had told others (this job was related with the NHS), this usually means I get treated kindly but that's the problem after being out in the cold so long any kindness sends me a bit crazy especially by women, I've lost two jobs because I developed insane crushes on people, my question is how can I get things cleared from my record? I have a unique name but if I google myself nothing comes up so I guess employers make more detailed searches or view my NHS file, also a few years earlier a guy was attacking someone in a shop and I helped stop him but it was reported that I had been in the shop when this man came in and attacked me!, this was in the papers but they spelt my name wrong so I'm not sure if this comes up, on another job a guy I was friends with was bullied I was called in to talk about this I tore into the place and I suspect they thought I had been bullied too, I don't use this employer as a reference or on my cv, is it possible new employers learn about this too?

My friend is a quiet person and doesn't really interact with anyone at work minus me and his direct supervisor. I've known this person for a while as we have met outside of work and have actually worked together in the past and I can attest that this person would be the last person to discriminate against another person.My friend was shaken after the incident.

"Why Do Youtube Videos Never Seem To Need Citation? Hello, Legal Reddit.I've got a question I've always wondered about, and I was hoping someone on here could shed some light on this particular conundrum.I've been working on a short video piece for a class, and while I'll certainly be making some sort of citation document on the side to go along with my submission for the educational side of things, there's something I've always been curious about on the video side of the equation that has always stood out to me as a researcher.When on Youtube, like many, I've fallen down the ""documentary"" rabbit hole many times. Like any good documentary, many of these videos will point to things like historical documents, scientific papers, or anything else that might be useful as a source. That being said, however, when it comes time to credit these sources, many of these videos get away with just listing the name of the document or vaguely specifying the organization before moving promptly along.Down in the description, occasionally you might also find links to some of the resources, but rarely does it link to all of the images, text, or other media it might use in it's production.My question is, especially for very profitable channels such as perhaps ""Game Theory"" or ""The Infographic Show"", how exactly do they get away with that?

"Airbnb host strong-arming me, afraid contacting Airbnb will make situation worse I'm doing an internship this Summer and booked a room for me and my wife via airbnb. I booked this 6 weeks ago, the booking duration is for 12 weeks in the Summer, starting in 3 weeks.A couple days back, the host cancelled saying the last guest trashed the room, and the room wouldn't be fixed for the first couple weeks of our rental. I asked him if we could stay in the trashed room, or on the couch, until it was fixed, as at this point finding a place, especially a short term rental, is way out of budget. These are short term rentals in the bay area- our initial booking for 12 weeks was $4,500. Now looking at similar places 3 weeks from the move-in date, we'd have to pay north of $10k.I contacted Airbnb support and they proudly told me I was compensated a $160 coupon, only usable on a booking of $4,100 or more. They also said they'd message me a list of similar rooms. They haven't gotten back to me with that, probably because they know that similar rooms aren't on their platform for those dates anymore.According to Airbnb listings our host rents out many rooms in a couple of houses in the area. He offered for us to stay in another room for ~4 weeks then move to yet another room. I agreed, and he said tried undo the cancellation with Airbnb, but they were not able to undo a cancellation. He then sent me his phone number and proposed we do a rental contract outside of Airbnb, and I Zelle him the first month's rent upfront.I was open to this idea, but verified with others and decided sending him $1,500 via Zelle was not a good idea. I offered to book the other rooms via Airbnb or pay on arrival. He said he was doing us a favor by helping accomodate us, and would not hold a room without a deposit. He opened the rooms on Airbnb, but the total cost was $5,600, $1,100 more than previous. The best part is, since it's 2 separate bookings of $2,800, I can't even use the $160 coupon Airbnb gave me earlier.I told him I felt like he assumed very little risk with pay-on-arrival, since we're willing to sign a rental agreement, while I assume a large risk. I offered to pay the full $4,500, allowing him to circumvent Airbnb fees (which again, was his idea originally). I told him it felt like he was strong-arming us.He did not respond to my messages. After about an hour, I booked the Airbnbs for $5,600, and he accepted them promptly. After I booked, he said he was ""sorry I felt like I was being strong-armed"", that we didn't have to book it, but he would have left the rentals open, and the ""risk would have been with us if it was booked"".Due to how little help Airbnb was and the fact that we have booked a place already, I'm worried if I contact them the situation will get worse- if the host is warned or banned, he'd assuredly not rent out to me. I also got the vibe Airbnb does NOT have my back- being cancelled on this close to the date is a really difficult situation, and the type of which I thought booking through Airbnb would protect against. This host appears to book around a dozen rooms at this rate, so I imagine they have far more incentive to protect him than me. Even if they didn't, and banned him, that wouldn't resolve my situation.One more thing: the new bookings are for 1 person. The last one was for 2. I'm worried that he may use this to pull something else when we show up as 2 people.As far as evidence, he sent me his phone number via Airbnb messages, but the correspondence isn't extremely clear that he proposed going outside of Airbnb- it's enough for plausible deniability. He proposed it in a call, and I discussed it via text in further communication.",1

" Formal written warning ?? Somewhat long.... Okay so I've been with my company for 5.5 years now. Never been in trouble until recently.About 4 months ago a coworker of mine returned to work after her maternity leave. We had previously butted heads but were okay because we didn't work the same shift, when she returned to work she transferred to my (graveyard) shift.Within a few days we were starting to have some issues that spiraled out of control. I lost my temper and made a rude hand gesture at her in a fit of pique. I immediately turned myself into my on duty supervisor for doing it once I cooled down. I went as far as turning myself in to HR because I felt guilty and realized that I'd gotten hot headed. At the time I was given a verbal warning and signed an acknowledgement of such.Yesterday my manager came in to work a day shift and asked me to step into her office. I did, not aware of what was coming. She informs me that she has had reports from several departments that I have been spreading ""malicious gossip"". She informs me that I'll be receiving a formal written warning. When she gave it to me it listed 2 dates, but no specifics about the incident (s) that supposedly happened (basically it said ""on day X and day Y you spread malicious gossip"" no times or places or anything).I signed the write up because I didn't really feel like I had much choice.When I got home I called our HR department to request a meeting but am unsure how to prepare. I feel frustrated that in the span of 4 months I somehow went from never in trouble to a full write up. No mitigating steps were taken in the interim and no guidance was provided by my manager.So when I meet with HR....how can I clearly communicate my issues without making it seem like I'm blaming my boss?",0
 New Boss Well it looks like a lot of changes are coming my way. My coworker left the company a few months ago and I’m also getting a brand new manager. Any tips during this transition?

 Moved from CA to TX and loosing my vacation days Hey all! I'm hoping someone out there can help me figure this out. I worked in CA for 6 years and accrued 25+ vacation days when I accepted a remote position for the same company (that operates in different states) and moved to TX. It's the end of the year soon and I was told that my vacation days that I accrued in CA cannot carry over in TX and will be lost if I don't use it. I tried to take all of them before the end of the year but my manager isn't giving me more than 10 days vacation as we have a project deadline and I'm leaving the team in Jan. HR is only offering to carry forward 5 days but I stand to loose the rest. No one is budging to accommodate my situation and I'm pissed.I read that vacation days earned in CA is the same as wages earned and stay forever until I quit the company. I'm not sure how this law translates if I move between states. Looking for any advise.,0
" Employee constantly threatening with ADA. Let me preface with this: Yes, he should be fired. Trust me. I want to. Every day.So, long story short, we have an employee who is making everyone miserable. He went from model employee to a living nightmare. He is using “mental health issues” and “chronic illness” for reasons he’s like this. Examples, 30+ minute bathroom breaks in addition to his regular breaks, leaving early, being late, and calling out multiple times a week, snapping on other employees and just overall being mean/rude, and then citing the ADA as to why we have to accommodate him and can’t question him. We’re a small company with no real HR department and we can’t really deal with him suing over ADA violations.  We have done everything to make him “happy”. Let him pick his own schedule, included him on bonuses he didn’t deserve, help pay for dr bills and therapy, everything. The latest stunt is now changing his address with our payroll app to an out of state address we know he doesn’t live at and we think it’s because the taxes are lower in this other state or he’s trying to revive benefits there as well.Can we ask him to provide proof he moved or that his address changed? Can we even ask for proof of his mental health and physical health issues since he’s requesting accommodations non stop? Can we get in trouble if he changed the address for fraudulent reasons? Or can we just fire him without an ADA issues?Sorry if these are obvious questions, I just don’t know.",0
" A help for my very tech illiterate relative... Hi all,this is a bit confusing situation for me and my relative, so please bear with me. She is in the NC, USA.My relative and I are really close, and she is very tech illiterate. I often have to explain A to Z on how to click stuff and whatnot and try to have her learn as much as possible. I make sure to not submit anything on behalf of her.Today, she called me in panic that and told me that her previous submission for 2023 benefit election somehow showed as ""cancelled"" at her MyWorkDay.About two weeks ago, she had been notified to enroll/update her employee benefits by today 5PM (Oct 31). She told me she simply reviewed and signed everything without changing anything from previous enrollment details (no life changing events, no health changes etc). She has been at this employment (a large luxury company) for exactly about year now.I asked her if she really reviewed/signed, and she swore she did. She barely managed to resubmit her benefit election in time (again, no change from last year). After she took some deep breaths, I asked her to look around why it shows as ""cancelled"" instead of incomplete.In MyWorkDays, you can apparently see which corporate employee took what actions on an employee's certain actions. She said she could see chain of people and their 'actions,' and one of the corporate benefit analysts cancelled her initial submission for some reason. I was really confused why anyone would do that. I asked her to send me the enrollment guideline PDF file, and in the guideline, it said that if no other changes were made, then healthcare coverage (PPO)/life insurance policies will automatically rollover to next year, which I understood as ""if you don't change anything or not take any action, then you will automatically be enrolled in the exact same coverage.""I told her to send an email to all these corporate employees she could see in this chain processes, but if I am optimistically guessing, she should not be worried because as the enrollment guidebook said, if there is no specific change to be made, it will be automatically renewed as exactly same, right? I still don't get why her initial submission was ""cancelled,"" though.Another weird thing is that in her re-submission, there was a date ""Submit the election by Nov 8th"" not October 31st.sorry this is so all over the place....",0
"Auto Shop Negligence - Arizona I live in Southern AZ. Took my car in to have the front right axle replaced. Had the axle replaced, $550. Car seemed fine. Drove over to San Diego. Half way discovered steering was a bit hokey and it seemed to shake a tiny tiny bit while driving, but was able to carefully get there.Took it to a local small time shop in SD and they jacked it and on the spot told me and showed me the car was completely missing a critical bolt that held the lower control arm to the wheel. They told me that I was INCREDIBLY lucky that I didn’t get into bad accident, multiple times. They even said the guy from the parts department of the dealership was incredibly surprised I made it. They also told me this bolt has a self-locking function and normally doesn’t snap off or become loose. They also told me this bolt typically needs to come off during an axle replacement.So they fixed her up for $199, including the $10 bolt they grabbed from the dealer, an hour labor, and an alignment.What legal recourse or claim can I make here? I didn’t get into an accident and was on the hook for just the additional service. I am a bit unnerved that the part was likely forgotten… and that I could’ve potentially been killed if this car flew off I-8.Thank you.",1

"Sister is trying to get personal info from SO for cremation expenses Hey all. Due to a family member passing away, SO(the older brother) has been asked by his sister to provide his drivers license, birth certificate and a notarized letter of consent for cremation in order for her (youngest daughter, claiming to have power of attorney over the family member) to claim insurance. Thats what we're guessing anyways.She even stated that giving the info would help her cover the costs of cremation, and she was explaining how expensive it was and it was draining her funds already.He felt uncomfortable dishing out that info to her, to which she replied that he could give it to the woman or government official.He still refused and she became verbally agressive and spoke fast, he tried getting the point across that if she were power of attorney then why would she need his info to make decisions? We learned from the nurses that since he's the eldest that he has overall say and her requesting that made us wonder if she even was PoA. She has had a bad habit of lying these past few agonizing weeks, so understandably he doesn't fully trust her.Does anyone know why she would need that information?

" I'm curious about what HR would do, of anything: (1) abusive and oppressive communication, (2) lack of staff I (F) have a slew of issues that are compounding. I am considering taking them all to HR, but I'm concerned about retaliation. I'm also curious if HR can do anything. Issue 2 is more recent, but Issue 1 is ongoing.Back story is that I'm a rehire I used to be friends with the people who brought me back (""Ted"" and (""Dave"").  The boss above Ted and Dave is a badass, so we will call him ""GOAT"". Ted and Dave work in a different specialty, and we dont work together on any projects (I have one with Dave, but he doesnt do anything on it, and he doesnt respond to emails, show to meetings, etc).There is a third boss; he's just cool. GOAT and third boss work in my specialty, and we work together often. I like my work, and I like working with GOAT and third boss a lot.Eta:  Ted and Dave are still my superiors, even though we don't work together on projects. Ted (first boss), Dave (second boss), third boss, then GOAT (everyone's boss).Generally: Ted and Dave are pretty overtly nasty to me.  If I say goodmorning to them, they ignore me (idc, I don't really want to talk to them, im just trying to be professional). Their emails are always curt and accusatory.  They're never helpful, and I have not had a pleasant communication with either of them in 11 months.  With that said, I don't work with them, so they're easy to avoid.ISSUE 1: Ted is in charge of staffing, and support staff.  Currently, we have only have 2 actual support staff and almost 20 professionals. This means that    10 professionals are assigned to 1 support staff. I've never heard of staff having more than 3 or maybe 4 professionals at a time in my field.This obviously leads to a lot of complaints from the support staff about being overwhelmed.  Ted's solution is to push support staff duties onto the professionals.  I already work 10 hours a day doing my professional work.  This added 2 or more hours of work to my day.  During a 5-day work week, I am working 12 hours a day, if not more.Ted messed up by trying to make GOAT take over some support staff work relating to a project that I was staffed on, and GOAT put Ted in his place. I didn't tell GOAT, he found out through his own channels. But that only fixed the 1 project (so maybe it saves me 30 minutes a day). We still have the underlying issue of being poorly staffed.Is there anything HR can do?ISSUE 2 In my spare time, I started a voluntary lunch group at the firm for the professionals (and staff. If they wanted to join), to discuss changes in our field and how to approach particular problems. Third boss joined, receieves all emails and calendaring.  He has attended meetings as well.

"Class action lawsuit against Agero Hello,In short, I'm paying for a roadside assistance service with State Farm and they partner up with another company called Agero. I waited for a tow truck and no one showed up for up to 7 hours when I was completely stranded in the middle of nowhere. They couldn't assign anyone for me and they also wanted me to pay extra for an ""out of network"" tow truck. AAA showed up within 45 mins. Agero offered $20 compensation for all of this which I refused.This is the full story...I'm from Oklahoma and I spoke with several different lawyers in regard to a class action against Agero. I have Agero as my roadside assistant via state farm. I have seen so many people having issues with them. I will explain my situation below and please share your experience as well. Let's make this stop for good. I will also want to mention that they offered me a $20 gift card as compensation which I refused.On Saturday, October 1, 2022, our car was disabled in the Wichita Mountains near Indiahoma, OK.  There was no cellular reception where the vehicle was located, making a sticky situation even stickier.  We were able to find a ride and cell reception at the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge Visitor’s Center approximately 6 miles from where the vehicle was disabled.At approximately 4:50 pm on October 1, 2022, I contacted Agero (State Farm provider/partner) for Roadside Assistance.  After a somewhat long wait (high call volumes) I was able to reach a representative and set up a tow from Indiahoma, OK to Legend Honda in Lawton, OK.  I checked the request online after receiving the text message, and the representative I spoke with put the vehicle location as the Visitor’s Center, and not actually where the vehicle was disabled despite being provided an address and the GPS coordinates.  This may have just been a minor misunderstanding on their part, but we made it clear that we couldn’t wait with the vehicle due to lack of cell phone coverage, so we had to wait until the driver called us to let us know they were on their way before heading there (if something happened they wouldn’t be able to reach us nor would we be able to reach them).As soon as I realized this, I placed another phone call to Roadside Assistance and gave them the correct location of the vehicle, and the request was updated.  No driver had been assigned yet.  At about 5:30, we had to leave the visitor’s center as they were closed and had to close the gate to their parking lot, so at this point, we were illegally parked and waited on the side of the road as there was nowhere to go within a reasonable distance to the vehicle due to lack of cell phone coverage.I then remembered that I have Hondacare included with my bumper-to-bumper factory warranty for my vehicle, so I contacted them as well and opened a request for a tow with them.  At this point, it was after 9 pm.  Hondacare uses the AAA network, and we were given an estimated wait time of about 1 and a half to 2 hours max.  No one had been assigned to my request at Agero (state farm partner) yet.Shortly after I made my request with Hondacare, I received a call from Agero (State Farm provider/partner)  roadside assistance stating that they contacted all in-network providers and no one accepted the case.I was starting to get frustrated as it’s been over 4 hours already, and I am illegally parked, stranded in the middle of nowhere.  The representative stated that no one in-network could take the request, but they could try again in 2 hours.  We asked them to try again in half an hour, and they said they would. I was being very patient with them.We waited for another hour, then got another call from the Agero (State Farm provider/partner)  Roadside Assistance representative.  They said once again that no one was available to tow us.  However, we could go out of network and pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket and then apply for reimbursement.We weren’t going to do that, we pay for a service that is supposed to provide us with towing that we pay monthly for, and we need to get this service that we are paying for.  The representative also told us that there was one that may be able to come in 4 hours (that would put us at 12 am-1 am waiting time from the beginning at 4:50om).  We asked that they keep trying.  At this point, it was starting to get dark.  Really dark since it was a mountain road.We waited another hour or so, and then called Agero once again.  Given the situation, the representative escalated the request.  I requested a supervisor, and the representative said she contacted her supervisor and there was a wait, and placed me on hold.  In the meantime, my request seemed to magically have a driver assigned and we would have a 1-hour wait (this is after giving them a statement from a lawyer that I called so they provided me with a driver immediately after).  Even more interesting, the tow company was the same one that was offered prior out of pocket for hundreds of dollars.  I got sick of waiting for the supervisor and had the number of the tow truck driver in the request, so I reached out to them myself and it was confirmed that it would be about an hour as he was dropping a vehicle off in Lawton as we spoke then would head straight to us.An hour passed, and we contacted the tow truck driver again.  He still has not left Lawton and was still dropping off the previous vehicle.  This was getting fishy, but he told us another 30 minutes or so and that he would be there.  I waited another 30 minutes, then called the driver again and they sent me to voicemail.  At this point, I called Agero Roadside Assistance once again to see what was going on.Since it had been more than an hour and a half, Agero canceled that tow and started looking for another tow, they admitted that this should have been reassigned after 60 minutes.I requested to be transferred to a supervisor, and had a long wait time again, but was eventually transferred to Charlotte.  While this was happening, I got a call from the owner of the towing company (Liberty Tow), stating that the payment card that was provided by Agero was getting declined and his employee wasn’t comfortable coming out to get us until this was resolved.  This was guaranteed to be another half hour after this was resolved for them to get to us since they were coming out of Lawton and hadn’t left yet, so I told them to just not bother coming at all.",1

" Poor performance due to mental health and family How much do I talk about my family struggles with my boss, in my new job, where I am already struggling?

The pay and flexibility are great, so I want to do what I need to keep the job. Some of the stuff my colleagues are able to do, well, it's beyond me. I figured that with time, I could at least learn some of it, and maneuver my way to a different position if needed, and at worst, make them fire me.

Typical customer service work.At no point was I told that my willingness to do one job impacted my employment for the other.Recently, they began to ask me to start working on a software project, but said they couldn't offer any payment. When I declined to do this, the owner of the company sent me a furious email saying that since I was unwilling to do this job (for free), he would consider my employment null and void. Effectively I am also being fired from my customer service job, which I desperately needed.I saved pdfs of the emails, and I even saved a phone call where he asked me directly to work for free.Should I consider legal action? If so, who should I talk to?",1
"Registering as a company in order to buy and own copyrighted assets. Hello, I’ll try keep it as brief and simple as possible.What route should I take if i want to register as a company in order to secure the company name and pay creators to make assets for a game project that I am working on alone?I have a number of freelance artist, animators, designers, etc that want to create assets for me. I will be paying for them for it and they have agreed that these will be owned by my studio. It will not be a salary, just a fixed amount for these assets.Should i be registering as an LLC, company, business, studio? Will I be looking at annual fees of some sort? The company also won’t be expected to be making any sort of revenue any time soon.I am located in Australia as a student, but I am American and looking to be registering it there. Most likely in the state of Florida.I’ve looked at USPTO. gov, but before I continue I just want to get a bit of guidance and make sure first.",1
" Do I Have Any Recourse? I work in Texas. I have a coworker who has Narcolepsy. She sleeps at her desk quite often. She seems to perk right up when it's time to eat or clock out or play around on the internet, but is sound asleep when actual work needs to be done. This company is small. 4 people including the boss. She is also a family friend of the owner.Our HR department only handles payroll. If we have serious issues that require HR's attention, she tells us to talk to the owner who in turn, gets hostile that HR was involved. I have seen this in the past, so I am reluctant to go to HR.My issue is with her workload being dumped on me while she snoozes. I am doing her job and mine and only being paid for mine. My boss makes accommodations for her and gets really hostile when anyone mentions anything about her screwing around on the web and sleeping.We now work from home but it is evident that she is not working, at all. My boss will not confront  her but will yell at me if her work isn't done in a timely manner.I am certain I have zero recourse and should probably find another job if I want anything to change. I just thought I would ask here as well.",0

" Seeking advice on hostile work environment I’ve worked at my restaurant for 8 years through three parent companies. Over the summer, a server was hired who decided early on that she did not like me. This was not a big deal to me at the time, so I mostly ignored it and tried to be nice to her when we interacted. However, she was objectively not a great hire. She would show up high as a kite and then leave during her shift to get high, and her work ethic was about what you’d imagine. This was at a time when we were short-staffed, so her absence and lack of contribution were incredibly palpable.Eventually, she took issue with my seniority and created drama with me, essentially saying that my getting “good” shifts takes money out of other people’s pockets. She badmouthed me to other servers and got them to band together to keep me from getting closing shifts on the weeknights, an arrangement I’ve had there for years not just because of seniority but because I keep my children while my husband is at his 8-5, so I literally can’t come on any earlier. I also do a damn good job and have relationships with our regulars going back years, whereas she has picked fights with customers.Are you wondering what the hell kind of management team we have? It’s one of the worst I’ve ever worked for, and I’m working my way out, particularly after the most recent incident.A few weeks ago, I found out during my shift from another server that I was no longer closing that night. I asked the manager on duty, Bart, if that was truly the case. He said, “Well, the server you’re having ongoing drama with says she hasn’t been making a lot of money lately, and I figured since you picked up a shift this week, I’d let her take your close.” I was obviously pissed but didn’t kick up a ton of drama about it that night. However, I found out later that week from another server that this shit-starting server delighted in getting my closing shift taken from me. So I went to Bart to discuss that she is creating a hostile work environment for me, and his response? To disclose that she’s actually being sexually harassed by our GM. Which is obviously not okay but it’s not a credit to her personality, it has absolutely nothing to do with me, and it was completely inappropriate to share that with me in that way at that time. I am actually extremely trustworthy with sensitive information, but I side-eye anyone who shares something like that so casually.I had to follow up with him every shift following that because it felt like he has decided my situation with her wasn’t a big deal. In fact, a couple times he had said that he needed to deal with the sexual harassment first. Eventually he did talk about it with her, and this man actually told her in the same conversation that I had highlighted her marijuana use when talking to him about her being hostile towards me! So she, unsurprisingly, became worse towards me and managed to turn more servers against me.She has since contacted HR and filed a complaint about them showing favoritism. And I’ve since experienced sexual harassment by the GM. Apparently he does it to every female staff member.Do I have any options from here? I don’t want to work for such a shit-show of a management team, but if it’s possible for me to say anything, I’d like any advice on how to best approach the conversation. I have the opportunity to meet with the district manager soon, and I was thinking of sitting down with him with an organized version of this post to keep unnecessary details to a minimum.I mentioned earlier that we’re on parent company number 3, and I want to highlight that again because it means that my standing with the company only goes back a year. Most of the previous staff has moved on, so I don’t have a ton of good people to vouch for me.",0

" I have misused my responsibility for personal recreation at my student job as an international student. What are the consequences. So, I have this job for over 2 months where I work at the compute lab and purchase hours for gaming room users. I have played in the university gaming room since my freshman year and have spent over 700$ so far. However, I had to get a job this semester as I was in a financial trouble. I thought using the system admin access to add hours to my personal account was just like eating at the back as a restaurant server (maybe I just rationalized so). Anyways, I had a talk with my supervisor and director and they said ER are reviewing my case. I am extremely worried because I just wanted to use the esports room for recreational purposes. Because I am an international student, I am worried the consequences might be more than simply being fired. Maybe I am overthinking, but I need advice on what I should expect and what I could do. I have emailed my supervisor and ER with additional details and now waiting for their reply.Upd 1: Investigation will be over within a week and they are planning to have a discussion with me. I will post the updates. I talked personally with my supervisor and said he will do his best so I can “resign” from my job as I explained how damaging it might be for me if they fire me.",0
"Father and Firearms Hi! Hopefully I can gain some insight on how to handle this situation. In October my father had a hemorrhagic stroke. They didn’t think he would survive. Thankfully he did. After rehab and hiring aids to assist he is back at home with mom.In December he fell and hit his head. Caused brain bleeding again. Due to Covid and his unwillingness to wait for a nurse and confusion they asked a family member to stay with him in the hospital. I stayed for two days and nights and it was continuous batshit crazy. He thought he was in a POW camp. Very delusional. Before he went home, I went first and removed all of his firearms, knives and ammunition.After returning home from the hospital he seems mostly normal now.  However, I don’t want intend to return the firearms as he does have some bouts of confusion. He is becoming more insistent that I return the firearms. I just can’t. He also isn’t going to drop it as the firearms are very much s part of his identity.I don’t think I have the legal authority to hold them, but returning them wouldn’t be ethical. If the brain bleed were to suddenly occur again he could because me very delusional again.

" Question about hours listed on paycheck vs actual hours worked Hello all,I am new to this subreddit but hoping someone can help me out or give me some feedback. I have been working at my company for almost 4 years as a full salary employee (was hourly previous to that at a different branch/location).My working hours are M-F 7am-5pm for a total of 10 hours a day or 50 hours week.What I have never understood/always questioned is why my (and everyone else's) paystubs show 86.66 hours worked. We are paid 2x a month, so I understand what is shown is for more than 1 week but what I do not understand is why my managers/bosses insist that everything is based on a 40 hour work week and that ""the hours listed on the paycheck are irrelevant."" Any time this is brought up they simply state that I am a salaried employee so hours worked/hours listed on the paystubs do not matter.For a little added context, in the 4 years I have been at this location I have been promoted 4 times. Each promotion has come with increased salary and a change in working hours (from 12hr days, to 11hr days, now to 10 hour days) yet the ""hours worked"" section of my paystub has always stated 86.66 hours. If accurate my current paystubs should be showing ~110 hours worked per pay period).I am in the wrong for thinking something is not right in this situation? Any feedback/comments would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",0

" Question on if my HR office, which takes forever to answer questions, is even worth going to about issues? I work for a large company. Over the course of the recent (and even distant past) I have experienced different levels of harassment due to me being in a protected class. Other coworkers have experienced some levels of harassment because they are a minority. I have gone to middle management in the past with no luck, and tbh some retaliation. My HR director takes weeks, even sometimes months to get basic yes/no questions answered.Should I even bother going to HR if they take say 3 to 4 weeks to answer a question on timesheets or on simple policies? I have thought about just quitting but my friend who used to work in HR said I must do what is right, and at least try to go to HR.If an HR department consisted of 1 person and that 1 person took 3 to 4 weeks or even months to respond to a simple email, why should/would I or anyone for that matter go to them over a complex workplace issue such as harassment?

"Double jeopardy question Hi there, I’m unfamiliar with the criminal side of the law so I was hoping someone might clarify something for me.  My father in law was recently paroled out of prison for a crime he did 3 years for.  The crime was attacking an officer, fleeing the scene and going over state lines (Oklahoma to Arkansas).  I believe all were felonies.  The OK police caught him right over the border and subdued him by taser at which point the AR police took over.    He did his time in AR after conviction.  Now that he is out on parole, OK has a warrant out for his arrest for fleeing the scene of that same crime and his parole officer is saying he has to turn himself in.  The option for bail bond or attorney is not available due to him not having any funds.  Is this double jeopardy or does that not apply here. All advice welcome and thanks for reading!",1
"Any legal advice? Please help Ok so this is a rollercoaster of a story so please bear with me. I am an FSU student living off campus. On Tuesday, a shootout happened in front of my apartment, resulting in my car being wrecked by the car that was shooting and being shot at. When I came out of my apartment there was a blood trail leading to my doorstep, which is on the second floor of the apartment building. The following day I asked management if I can leave my car where it is until an adjuster takes it away the next day (it’s not obstructing the driveway or the sidewalk, it’s only taking up 2 parking spots rather than 1) and they said it is fine. The next day while I am on campus I get a text from my neighbor saying my car is being towed by management along with his and another neighbors (all 3 of our cars got wrecked by a chain collision when the shooters car hit mine). My car ended up being the only car towed bc I wasn’t there to fight my case unlike my neighbors. Now this morning, there was yet another shootout right in front of my apartment that happened around 4 am.Now I know this is very watered down version of the whole situation but I want to know if there is any type of legal action I can charge against anyone. This has left me with a great inconvenience, having to temporarily move on campus to be able to continue my classes but still paying rent in the place that was not able to provide security twice in a span of a week. (Not even including the day before the shootout when there were a couple shots fired and no police arrived on scene even after calls to them), and left with no transportation for a couple months at least until the insurance claim is settled. And many more unexpected expenses that I now have to deal with. And also add the mental hard it caused bc the shootout happened 15 minutes before I arrived home, where I avoided waiting those 15 minutes in cvs after getting my Covid vaccine shot, luckily avoiding being in the middle of the shootout, and the mental damage that comes with having blood trails leading to my front door and having a guy yelling that he’s been shot right i outside of it.Please let me know because I feel like there is but my knowledge of law is pretty low and I wouldn’t now where to attack this situation.",1

After the first incident, once I escalated it to a higher boss, he also denied that any harassment was taking place and that I was somehow misinterpreting it (I had been sent personal notes and cards from this person, a former politician that the office was familiar with, and besides that, he singled me out for this and never sent any such correspondence to anyone else there, so their argument that this was normal behavior was not valid), but assured me that if I was uncomfortable, I would no longer have to speak with him. My immediate bosses were aware of this. Not two weeks after this, he asked for me specifically on the phone and they transferred him to me without even mentioning who it was, or if I was okay with speaking with him.Papers ripped away from me in a dramatic fashion because I’ve yet again made someone angry by missing work due to sickness, family issues, or an emergencyCalls in which I was deliberately hung up on in disgust when I called to say I’d be late because my car was broken into and I had to contact the police and clean upAccounts of exactly what I’ve been doing at my desk reported back to me, because one of my colleagues (not a superior) sits behind me and has been closely watching me, and continues to do so - I am not doing anything strange, or different from anyone else, but she just feels the need to watch me and report everything I do back to my boss as though I’m doing something wrong - I’m not, but it puts me on edge since now I literally don’t know what I’m doing “wrong”I’ve also been subjected to loud, in-office discussions about how women who report rape or assault years after the fact are just lying for money - which make me seriously uncomfortable (I was raped at 18 and was just too scared to tell anyone); been told by my boss that “the CDC says COVID is officially over” and other anti-masking, anti-vaccine claims; and been given condescending “advice” on how I and the person I’m sharing my life with have wrong political and social opinions.",1

"Getting into Ex’s apt( I’m on the lease) Posted this in the advice subreddit and was suggested to post here :Throwaway account and here’s hoping to my ex not seeing this.

I took my essentials bc I knew I wouldn’t be able to come back to pick up the rest for a while bc of my college moving to in person; I left my keys bc I didn’t think I’d ever need them again(regretting that now). He sent some of my things with his mom (he offered, I didn’t want to bc his mom is not one who does favors with a good intent but accepted bc he said it was my Apple Watch, plants, and a small box of clothes he sent more than that without letting me know including things I was going to donate so sending them was a literal waste but then didn’t send things that were convenient for him to keep was then told I was ungrateful and that his mom didn’t even want to bring me my plants…okay?). The problem is I bought the furniture, and majority of the home essentials. I figured he’d use them until he decided to move out then I’d pick them up with the rest of my stuff and sell the furniture, after making it clear he didn’t want “my” stuff in his apartment I want to get my things and not deal with this anymore but now he’s saying he’s keeping the furniture and shipping my things to me (which again I bought the furniture and I left my bike there and glassware so shipping will obviously not be an option). I want my things back I have an older friend who is suggesting taking him to small claims court if he doesn’t give me my things bc the furniture is quality and not expensive but of value and the bike is pricey but honestly I don’t see myself doing that. Will the apartment complex let me into the apartment if I ask? I’m on the lease and I don’t think they know I’m no longer living there. I also contributed a large amount to the security deposit but by the way he’s been acting I doubt I’ll be seeing any of that anymore. I know there are obviously a lot of mistakes made here, being over him has made me see where I should’ve protected my own interests more and that trusting all would be amicable was a miscalculation on my part, lesson learned for the future but I need advice on how to handle this so that I can avoid some more regrets down the road.

" Negotiate more severance? I got laid off today, along with most of my team. Unfortunately I’d been “saving” most of my unlimited PTO for a trip I leave for in two days, which is three weeks long. I feel completely screwed over buy this. It’s been approved in our HR system for about six months.I’m getting 8 weeks severance. Is it within the realm of possibility to try and negotiate an extra two weeks to compensate for this? Or should I just let it go and move on? I don’t really have any ground to stand on except that it feels wrong when it’s been documented that I have this PTO approved.Update - I asked for an extra two weeks and they gave it to me. I framed it as “this time away has been approved for six months and we’re going into the holidays, an extra couple of weeks will help my family as I transition to a new role” more or less.",0
"If my student loan has no interest left on it, is it still worth paying off the principal early? My wife has about $9000 left on her student loans. The interest rate was 7% and it says the remaining interest is about $20. We were wondering if it made sense at all to put a lump sum of money toward the loan from our savings.If nothing else, there are psychological benefits to having the loan gone and dealt with. We're currently putting $550/month toward the loan. If we went ahead and paid it off, it would take about a year to build back up our savings.Also, is it really only $20 in interest remaining? They're suggesting we pay $200/month for almost 8 more years... would they really want to do that with no more interest?",2
" - What’s the likelihood of potential employers actually verifying job history (for low skill positions)? The past several years I have been working in factory jobs & retail before that.

I have also bounced around a lot.Most of the jobs around here require you to stand the whole shift, which I can’t do without extreme pain.

" I've been Mistakenly Underreporting my Hours Hello all,I got my first salaried position out of college about 6 months ago and it has been going well. When I first joined, I was told to make my timesheets equal 40 hours, which is how I allotted my time.Fast forward a few months, things got really busy and I was working well over 40 hours. However, I was still reporting my standard 40 hours (because when I joined that is what I was told to do). Nobody said anything, and I finally decided to ask a fellow coworker and they said I should have been reporting the hours the whole time.This whole situation kind of irks me because I have been working really hard and I don't feel like it is going to be recognized through the timesheet process because I was told wrong and didn't think much past that.I guess this comes down to my question: Is this something super important I need to bring up?

" Need Desperate Advice in Addressing/Abruptly leaving Toxic Work Environment I left my previous company (engineering consultancy) on good terms some months back looking for something new. I found another consultancy closer to home that seemed like a great fit. It is a young and friendly team and from the beginning I thought I made the right choice. I was interviewed by the head of the discipline in another city, but I never met my line manager until I began working. Now after almost four months, I really cannot stand working with him and it has taken a great toll on my mental and physical health.While the rest of the team is really good to work with, he has shown himself to be very belittling, demanding, blunt, and overall difficult to work with. It's as if I am both working to meet deadlines for clients but have to continually watch my back to make sure he does not get upset about a minute detail on a spreadsheet. In terms of work, he is quick to nitpick any sort of small detail, does not show any encouragement whatsoever, and is never quite satisfied with my work even if I was up until 2am the previous day trying to get it done. Needless to say, he is not the kind of person I can go for help in project work, so I'm left to address ambiguities of my work on my own and hope that when he reviews it, he will agree with my approach.It's just has not been a healthy working environment and I want to leave. What's sad is that everything else about the team is amazing. However, as his only report I feel I'm the only one that really gets to see this side of him although I can see that the rest of team is a bit uncomfortable when it's comes to him. It's almost like a school bully scenario, where one simply does what they can to not get their attention.This month I have done what I can to get out, I've been sending applications and have already had a few interviews but have yet to hear back. The hard part is having to explain why I want to leave after only 4 months at the current place. From reading online, it seems prudent to never mention management issues so I've come up with an explanation that work is different from what I was expecting. In general I feel that I'm throwing up red flags since I'm changing so suddenly, but I'm not sure how I can deal with that.In the same vein, if I was to quit (which I could do with my savings), I'm afraid of then having to find a reason to explain what I did without the interviewer assuming I'm the issue. So I'm stuck in a really bad place, although I would quit even if I didn't have a job as it is too much. However, the practical side of me thinking of my future prevents me from doing so.Beyond this, I wanted to ask about how I can deal with references when I eventually do leave. There's another more senior engineer that I get along with and occasionally work with, that I could ask but I'm wondering about what I say when I leave to not ""burn bridges."" I keep being conflicted between making up some reason about being overworked instead of saying that it has been due to my line manager. Since I'm afraid that if I'm honest, I might be considered the issue and will not get a good reference which will then lead to the initial issues once more of not being able to secure a new job. The other thing is that I do need this reference since I have not been in the UK long and this is only my second job here. So not providing one from here might also throw some red flags.This is to say that I feel trapped in my current employment, but due to future prospective job opportunities, I am unable to quit as it might impede my employability further. I suppose I'm just wondering if any of you have gone through similar experiences and how did you deal with it. I would appreciate any advice.",0

She only went outside to go to the bathroom, on a leash, and then would eat and sleep in her kennel. after 2 years of this (i know.

"Ontario: Scheduling Changes Causing Missed Work due to a lack of informing of said changes As the title states, I'm in Ontario, Canada and recently, my employer made changes to the schedule without informing me of said changes causing me to miss a day's pay.  Errors with the scheduling happens quite frequently and has happened to me three times in the past year.   They informed me once of the change but let's just say relations hasn't been good and they have kept communications rather sparse.   Something to note is they require us to have 3 weeks in advanced for any time off requests but schedule changes seem to be done with less than a week's advanced notice.   I don't see how this is fair, but according to this link it seems Ontario doesn't require employers to even inform us of changes.Can Employers Change your Schedule Without Notice in Ontario? - Levitt Sheikh Employment & Labour Lawyers (levittllp.com)I'm not sure if it's the same as not required to let us know it has changed rather than asking for permission.   How else would an employee realize their schedule has been changed and take the necessary steps to make sure they can work or not or in the latter case, inform their employers they can't fulfill that obligation.   It really seems like they make changes at their whim and with impunity although I haven't heard of anyone being reprimanded when they don't show up for their shift that was a late change.So this isn't a question about seeking compensation but more about how to protect onself if they try to play games and accuse you of not coming to work.",1

" is HR protecting my toxic boss? This is going to be long, TIA.My boss is a known bully to everyone on the HR team. We are in TA, so we coordinate with HR often.He is openly rude to team members during HR meetings, he’s been openly rude to an individual during a marketing meeting, and it had gotten to a point a couple months ago where he was completely icing out and “quiet firing” my teammate for no apparent reason. He would call me multiple times a day every day (I wfh) for 10-30 minutes at a time just to talk AT me and complain about this employee, and the fact that they had asked for a raise. He shared details from conversations that should’ve remained private, and just bad-mouthed every single person on our small team and even shared his negative thoughts of the Executive team and other hiring managers.He’s referred to the LGBTQ+ community as random letters and numbers multiple times because “it’s just too much for him to remember”, he’s called a new hire r*tarded, he’s anti-BLM, fat-phobic, and the list just goes on and on of how inappropriate he is.After getting fed up and deciding to ask other coworkers if they had this experience, I’ve found that he’s called other people multiple times a day just to talk at them and gossip to two other people at various times throughout his time at this company.I reported all of his behavior to the VP of HR with audio recording of the gossip and fat-phobic examples and had a coworker corroborate these same behaviors during his exit interview the same week. They claimed an investigation was done, yet nothing changed except he stopped calling me multiple times a day. In fact, he has stopped communicating and meeting with me 1:1 pretty much all together the past 2-3 months. I think he is “quiet firing” me the same way he did to my old teammate. This feels like retaliation, and I also feel like HR is protecting someone they shouldnt.There are so many more details I could share about his inappropriate behavior if you need context but I just feel unsure about it all and would love a professionals opinion?",0

"analytical correct efficient price of an option under simplified hypothetical conditions I'd like you to help me work through my thinking, with easy, big, round, numbers and perfect information.

We will have a pharmaceutical company that has all its eggs in one basket, and a single stochastic event.

The event is that in 365 days a study result will be in, and either the company is worthless (worth $0) or worth $100 billion. (just accept this stochastic condition please.)

For ease of computation, let's say that due to the efficient market the current trading price is $50 billion, since it perfectly factors in the single stochastic event - i.e. due to 50% chance of being worth $0 and 50% chance of being worth $100 billion, it is therefore worth $50 billion.

Now.

How much should a call option for 1 year (and a few days) at a strike price of $75 billion be worth?

My thinking is that there is a 50% chance that it is in the money a 50% chance that it is worth 0%.

"I feel like my supervisor raises his voice at me when he's upset. Is that appropriate?  We meet one to two times a week to discuss updates but I work mostly independently. I am relatively new to this time of position and do not know the expectations without them being communicated to me. I learned a few months after starting that I was somehow missing something (I thought my supervisor was having communication issues but tried to brush it off, but my supervisor thought the same of me). This is related to work that my supervisor started ahead of me getting there, and I do not always have all of the information I need about all of the work that already happened as a result.Several months into the job, I learned about my supervisor's communication preferences because he notified me that he thought we were having communication issues (the fact it was my responsibility was implied). At this same time, I learned about expectations he had for my role for the first time and acted like I should have been aware of these tasks/structures. They are not explicitly stated in my job description. I been trying to adapt but it feels like a guessing game because I am supposed to tell my supervisor what I am doing, only to be told no, that's wrong, do it this (not wrong but specific and preferred) way. When there is a miscommunication about projects, he will sometimes raise his voice. I'm honestly a little afraid of having to talk to him because I have anxiety issues and until we had this conversation, I was otherwise blissfully unaware and otherwise okay with my job.I have a disability and think that could be a possible cause from my end, but I do not feel like this is fully my fault even though I'm open to adjusting my approaches. I was assigned a mentor who basically confirmed that it kind of is a guessing game but he was able to give me advice that helps in my meetings. Two people who were hired earlier than us left very early after starting (this is kind of heresay because I wasn't there yet) but this may have been due to job offers of higher salaries, not necessarily the jobs themselves. My supervisor is older and is an advanced professional, but I am an experienced adult with credentials myself.Is this a red flag? I was really excited about the position at first and have kind of lost motivation as a result. How early would it be to switch jobs in the same institution? I have a union contract, so I am aware it has to comply with that as well - any advice? I think I will stick it out for now and reassess in December. It's good for my career and I do not necessarily need my current position for anything other than a salary (no need for recommendations).

" Calling Black male co-workers Brother First-time poster and first-time manager looking for some advice here. To put it very simply, one of the people I supervise, a white female, has made it a habit to call her Black male co-workers “Brother.” Obviously this isn’t okay, and I’ve talked to the two main co-workers (who I also supervise) about it, checking in on how they felt about it and if they needed to be connected with any resources. They’ve both acknowledged it’s not okay, but thankfully they haven’t been personally offended and understand she has no malicious intent. We’re a very close group - all around similar ages and we generally all get along quite well, doing things together outside of work and being quite comfortable talking to each other about non-work subjects.

What is the most effective way to pursue action that will rectify this?  HR doesn't care, or doesn't know any better (possible, as our current HR director has no experience in the field).  Upper management seems oblivious, and even offered one of these people a third contract to help him pay for private health insurance (while still excluding him from company insurance).  I think an outside report is probably going to be essential to get this corrected.  Who do I report to?",0
" My job is causing too much stress   ever since I started this job I have had no training. Now, there are some things that I absolutely can not teach myself.

"Missouri. Hostile work environment. Considering quitting but I’m not sure if I’ll get unemployment. I posted about this almost a month ago and didn’t get a response, but I’m desperate. I am the youngest person in my office and my political views do not match theirs (not that I’m super vocal about it but they sure are) and I am beginning most mornings in years before I go in.Most recently, one of my bosses decided I must have a second job. This is because I took time off to drop off, pick up and care for my dog during and after she underwent heartworm treatment. She took me back to her desk in front of the public and berated me for ten minutes and repeatedly demanded to know what my second job was. I told her every time that I didn’t have one (I don’t). She evidently decided I was lying, that I was making up excuses (I wasn’t), and called our superior boss to report that I had a second job and was lying about it. I DO NOT HAVE A SECOND JOB. I HAVE A SICK DOG WHO WAS GETTING TREATMENT.I was then ordered to go into superior boss’s office to get berated and asked about my “second job” AGAIN. They kept telling me as well that “everyone has problems and they don’t bring them to work” (I am currently losing my home and car due to my partner cheating on me and leaving me with another woman while at the same time starting jokes and rumors that ruined my reputation; I can’t afford them on my own and sometimes I’ll go to the bathroom and break down for a few minutes because I have no family nowhere to go and no one that actually loves me except for my dogs. I do not break down in the office except when they are actually yelling at me in front of the public, which has happened on multiple occasions).Some months ago I got yelled and screamed at in the office, fingers shoved in my face because I asked one boss a question that my other boss thinks I should have asked her, despite the fact that she was busy at the time.I have been repeatedly given the silent treatment. I ask a question even to a room full of people and everyone makes a point of ignoring me. Sometimes someone will ask the exact same question or make the same point a few seconds after me and they are acknowledged, but again they make a point of ignoring me and only helping that person. Sometimes I’ll even ask for a book or item I need to do my job and it’s like they pretend I don’t even exist.I have heard my boss on multiple occasions talking negatively about me on the phone. I can hear her and there’s no doubt she knows that. She also gossips about my personal life in a deeply humiliating way and yes, I hear that as well. When I’m trying to have a private phone conversation they eavesdrop on me then actually call each other to talk to each other about what I said.One boss seems to think that it’s funny that my partner left me and teased me about it.We got new office chairs last year. Apparently they’re notoriously terrible across the office but I tried to make mine work. It ended up completely destroying my back and I had to WFH for a month or so while I was in the early stages of physical therapy. I was treated like I was a lying pest throughout this period. I couldn’t even stand up and take a deep breath without feeling the most excruciating pain. Apparently when anyone else here ditches the new chairs and deals with crippling back pain, it’s legit, but when I do it I’m just faking and dramatic.A coworker that sits behind me has decided to watch me work and reported back to my boss about everything I’m doing. Rather than tell her to mind her own business and work on her own stuff, my boss took me back to her desk and told me that I was being watched so I’d better be more careful. I’m just trying to do my damn job.I have had papers dramatically ripped away from me after I’ve been shown them. I’ve been told that I’m “making up excuses” for things like doctor appointments and deaths. I got hung up on after I called in to say I’d be late because someone broke into my car and I needed to call the police and take pictures and assess what had been stolen.",1

"How do some criminal cases have defendants that plead guilty without a plea deal (how exactly to pleas work)? I just read an article on the Christopher Belter case, where he was sentenced - as an adult - to no jail time for 3 counts of sexual assault and 1 count of third-degree rape.  I am confused that this individual plead guilty, and then the judge decided his punishment.  I was under the belief that pleading guilty was a mutual agreement between the prosecution and the defense, where the prosecution may offer a lighter sentence for pleading guilty to some of the crimes being charged.  How does the defendant enter into a plea deal with a judge?  If the defendant does plead guilty to a judge, how would a judge decide to go so far outside of sentencing guidelines?",1

" Medical Documents HiTo give some background, our company went fully remote during the pandemic for two years. We were told that we are now fully back in the office earlier this year, maybe June?Some people did not take this well and quit. I was indifferent, not happy but you do what you gotta do. As I started coming in, I noticed many people were not. Someone on the team came in the first day, then WFH till last week when they found a better position elsewhere. Their boss is overseas (HQ is in a different country) so they didn’t notice or know they were not in the office. One team consisting of 4 people is entirely WFH and they come in every now and then to collect stuff that they ship to the office. When they come in we chat because it’s nice to see them. I know for fact that they don’t have any special case going on other than work life balance and their boss made it work.I recently was diagnosed with an illness/injury (end of last year). This is an illness that has no cure and will continue to get worse with time. It is all about pain management at this point. It causes me to be excruciating pain with triggers like riding the train, long car car rides, sitting for prolonged periods, among other things. I went to physical therapy while I was on a WFH schedule and it was helping a lot. Then when we were ordered to go back to office it started to get worse again. But I was still going to therapy. Then they cut me off, insurance will not cover.With the added commute of 5 days a week and sitting for 9 hours a day my body could not handle this level of aggravation. So I collected my medical paperwork that I had and requested a hybrid schedule. Long story short, it got denied by the lady that works in HR.A week later I am hospitalized and it’s been really rough lately. My PCP wrote me note saying I cannot come into the office and need to work from home for the next 4 weeks. I sent it in.I get a call from my PCP saying my job has been calling them every 5 mins for paperwork and if I have anything additional. I get my pain management place to expedite send over the documents to my PCP.However I had to sign a HIPPA document for that. Does my employer have the right to all my medical history?  Do I have any privacy in this case?",0
Can I sue my job I was recently hired as a key holder at the childrens place. A little bit after I started working my manger started to schedule me against my availability. I went to talk to her about this and she tried to push me out of the postion. One of the issues is I have church on Sunday I told her this during the interview and agreed to work one Sunday a month and occasionally two. She started to schedule me every other Sunday. I asked her to give me sundays off whenever she could and offer to work before and after church some weeks as long as I could just go to church. She started to tell me that I could have off any Sunday I want if I took a lower paying position. The other issue is I’m a cheerleader and wanted off for some of my football games. We also talked about this in the interview. I made it clear that I understand I might not be able to get all of them off and I could work before and after them. She again wouldn’t even agree to try and offered a lower paying postion. I told her to find someone else for the job and then went to her manger. Her boss gave me my job back and told me that me having those days off was no problem and she didn’t understand the issue. After this she did a number of petty things and started scheduling me five days a week. When I was hired she said she would be scheduleing me for longer shifts and less days so I texted her about this asking if possible she could keep her word on this. She never texted me back so I waited for the next schedule to come out. She scheduled me for five days again so I went to talk to her. She told me their was nothing she could do which I know is a lie because I talked to the other part time keyholder before this and she has no problem working more days. She also said I changed my availability which never happen I only held her to the things she told me in the interview. Other associates also told me she made negative comments about me before I was even hired. Do u think I could take any legal action or would I not have enough for a case?,1

"Are limited credit cards used to avoid free trial gotchas fraud? Recently, I’ve seen lots of adverts for “privacy (dot) com” , which offers a service that lets you create multiple credit card numbers for different purposes. You can also set a spending limit on these individual “cards”, beyond which withdrawing from it will be declined. In many promotional sponsored segments in popular influencer’s content, this feature is often the focus, and it is shown being used to avoid automatic charges that are incurred in some subscriptions (if they’re not cancelled in time). In particular, free trials, which often automatically renew themselves as a paid plan subscription after the trial period ends, are shown being given numbers for which the spending limit has been set to zero dollars, meaning why attempt to charge them will fail. Does this constitute fraud? After all, you are entering a payment channel address that you know will not work where it’d be expected to work. You are withholding payment, pavement you, in some sense, promised.",1

" Reported Bullying Behavior with Physical Aggression but was told by Director to treat this at a lowest level. I have experienced multiple bullying/hostile treatment of screaming and shouting by a co- worker (all with witnesses). This bully is known to have a close tie with upper management. She always brags as how many hours she is donating to the company as she stay over almost every day just to finish work for FREE. Bully would drop names and say “ Mr so and so told me that if someone is giving me a hard time I will let him know” She would give me some of her work saying it’s part of my responsibility while I am overwhelmed with my own responsibilities. The recent incident was she was screaming and pointing fingers at me in front of my teammates about a phone call that is supposed to be for her. I told the other person on the line that the phone call is meant for her as she handle those type of cases. She heard me mentioned her name but instead of clarifying what this phone call about she was screaming and pointing fingers at me and threaten me “YOU will SEE” I was so humiliated by her disrespectful behavior towards me in-front of my team, I stood up and told her (not yelling) but firm “can we talk in a professional way?” I said I don’t understand why you are acting this way?” Why so much hatred? All of a sudden I saw my other team mate got pushed by the bully to the ground. My team mate decided to go in between us to stop the whole drama but she got pushed by bully. The next day I found out that she reported incident to the management with her own version. I Reported bullying incident to my supervisor via email. Later the director sent someone to train in my position of which the bully said the director had asked her (the bully) opinion’s on who else can train in my position. I had meeting with director two weeks after the incident and was told that If I cannot work with her I have to re- evaluate myself cause positions  including mine will be awarded by bid and management pick and that he wanted the incident to be treated in the lowest level. I felt threatened, intimidated and scared. I told the witnesses that I don’t want them to take sides but I expect them to tell the truth as I was hoping management will be fair in their investigations. One of the supervisor was asked to inquire from witnesses but when they found out the truth- they kept quiet but they did not ask written statements from me the bully and witnesses. 2 weeks after, they were adding more work to me,  I ask copy of the minutes of the meeting but didn’t get one.I felt unfairly treated, I felt the company didn’t live up to their standard.

"Figuring out how much time to take off after a career change  I recently retired from teaching after 5 years. The last day of school was at the end of June, but technically my resignation wasn't official until September 6th. I decided to leave largely because I realized I needed an easier job. I'm planning on doing a career transition into tech, because I was a computer science major in college and it's probably my strongest marketable skill.In the mean time, I've been taking time off. Time off to not stress out about work for the first time in a while. I was speaking to a friend of mine who works in tech, and he advised me to start working again sooner rather than later. He said because of the recession, getting a job will only get more and more difficulty if I wait too long, and too large of a gap might not look good on a resume.However, I mentioned this recently to a friend who works in HR, and he was a lot less worried that this would be an issue at all. He told me that if an applicant to his company had a job within the last 6 months, he wouldn't even bring it up at all, and that because I'm doing a career change, I could probably take a year off without much of an issue.Wanted to ask what the general consensus might be on who I should listen to hear and how long of a break is ok.

"Ohio, United States - recourse for landlord entering without advanced notice? I live in an apartment complex in Ohio. Our lease got bought out by a new management company and I can no longer access my electronic lease agreement because it didn't transfer to the new system and I regret not printing my own hard copy. They claim that they only need to knock and announce that they are entering and that they can technically enter at any time, but that doesn't sound right to me. I'm already moving out in May when I graduate but I keep having issues. My landlord has been having contractors do renovations around the complex. They've entered my apartment multiple times without proper advance notice and done damage to my stuff, plus I have a cat and they've put her at risk.The first instance was in September when they were renovating the plumbing. They gave me a notice about updating the electrical work with instructions to move all of my furniture away from the walls and unplug all appliances each day in the one-week window when they would be doing this work. They never did the electrical work, but the day after the one-week window they came in and replaced the sinks and toilet. To do so, they dumped all my stuff out from under the sink and left it in a pile on my kitchen floor, and again in the bathroom. They also left construction materials (washers and screws) on the floor and they weren't exactly careful about how they did this, so there was an overturned bottle of bleach that spilled on my kitchen floor. I contacted them about it because I was concerned about my cat potentially drinking bleach or eating/chewing a screw and getting a foreign body, they assured me it would never happen again.The next time it happened, they were redoing the patio and porch lights. They gave a week's time frame to do it and then showed up after the allotted time frame. They dealt significant damage to my home garden. They also left chunks of metal from the railing project as well as paint can lids and paint brushes in my plants. At this point they gave me a 100$ rent reduction for the month to offset the cost of the damage.Today they entered without providing any advance notice to do the wiring project that they mentioned in September. They didn't do as much damage this time, but they still left construction materials all over the floor and my grow light for my houseplants no longer works.Is there any legal recourse to keep them from continuing to do this? I'm not as concerned about the damage to my stuff as I am about the potential harm to my cat, since they leave doors open when they're working and they leave screws and such on the floor. I really would just like advanced notice so I know to lock my cat up for the day, but I can't find any good sources for how far in advance a landlord needs to notify you to enter an apartment in Ohio. Would it be worth contacting a lawyer or is this something I'll just need to deal with until may? I'm a graduate student so money for a lawyer is tight.I do have photo evidence of all three instances and I've retained all the emails and the letters that they taped to my door.",1

"Can options contracts be priced less than $1? Since options contracts are for 100 shares each, is the lowest one can possibly be priced $1?Options are for 100 shares, but are priced per-share, and so premiums for puts or calls seem to be priced in penny increments. As a result, the lowest-priced option that I've seen is priced at $.01 per share, and hence $1 for the contract.Is this universally the case? Or is there anyone making markets (accessible by everyday people) that will price options in sub-penny prices per share, and so contracts sold for less than $1?I'm learning about options trading, and am exploring edge-cases that arise from how the markets for them work. Thanks!",2

" My company is moving to a new office space, which is causing some issues for me The company where I work is moving to a new office space. In the transition, we are also moving from arranged seating to an ""open workplace"" with free seating.My problem is that I work with image- and video editing, product design and development, some light VFX work - basically tasks that are pretty hardware demanding and colour sensitive. This means that today I have two calibrated monitors and a tower workstation PC.The problem is that I need to follow the new policy of free seating and A: Need a laptop and B: Need to calibrate or work around whatever monitor I am placed infront of each day.Edit: I should mention that I am basically the only one at the company with these requirements. We have a photograpger - but she works remotely, as does our graphic designer.Is there anything I can do to mitigrate or work around this? What demands can I make?Edit: I have talked to both my boss (new since 2 weeks) and the owner. The reply I was given is that ""policy is policy"" and no exceptions will be made. This is most likely due to the ""free seating arrangements"" not being a popular move and most would prefer a permanent desk. Should also mention that it is a small company with some 20 employees in total.I am also unsure if there is a laptop that can actually ourperform my current workstation.

" Issue with new coworker.. Should I ask HR? I've been working for a company close to 6 years as a developer. 5 months ago there was a new hire that I'll call Amy. She's a Project Manager. From the beginning the team and I have been confused on what her role exactly is. When I would send her some emails, she would reply to me with an attitude. I let it go in the beginning but later when working together she started being more and more rude. Whenever I ask her questions she usually goes to our manager to tattle (same manager) and my manager does one of the following: sends out an email to everyone, call me directly with Amy's question, or tell me in the meeting with the team about my concern.The issues have gotten worse lately. It has made a very toxic environment for me. I'm sure my boss knows of the issues. I got a very nasty email from Amy today, my boss was added in the email and said nothing of it. I see that my boss is on her side. Boss has been working around 6 years too.I reached out to HR to ask if she is available to meet. I would like to show her the email evidence of how Amy has been replying to me. I have been asking HR about what happens when someone leaves, do they get their vacation time paid in full, etc. I have been so stressed to the point that I want to resign. I don't want HR to talk to my manager or Amy about this, but I guess I wanted to let her know of this issue and to let me know if I might be wrong here. I have shown other people the emails I have received and they too see the attitude. Should I even meet with HR at all or ask if the things I show are confidential?",0

From a layman's eyes it seems to be at a loss compared to the previous year, but financial news report it at a huge win.It is my impression that the net cash inflow from operating activities is the main thing to look at here and not the equity - as the company was bought by the company Tencent at the time and a dividend has been paid to the former owner and present shareholder of the company Chris Wilson, of ~100 million.What confuses me is the comparison of a 12 and 6 month periods.

" I need desperate help with talking to my boss. Sorry this might be a little long. But I really need HELP. Technically (NV) and (PA) My problem is my boss is insisting on booking all of my hotel rooms himself. Mainly so he can receive all the rewards points. For his stay and mine. Plus my other co-worker.Little background I am F(39), my co-worker is also F(40-50) and our boss M(40-50). Also I am new to the corporate life and want to know how to handle myself in these situations.First trip he booked the rooms whatever right. I thought it was weird. When I got to the hotel I changed the room to only under my name and took his off. Then added my rewards account to the room. Took a little convincing with the front desk but when I told them our company paid they had no issue. When we got back from that trip. He made a comment to me. Telling me to not do that. He needs to get all the points on his (not our company, his personal) rewards account. Due to the fact he needs the points and status to book upgrades for anyone our company is hosting. In whatever area we are sending them to.I didn’t argue but was upset by the whole thing and weirded out. So This past trip when I check in it’s all under his name and not mine. I have to use his last name to login into the wifi and all. Before my co-worker and I got there he texted us saying he checked us in and sent a picture of our different room keys. To come to his room and get it from him. Then he said never mind get it at the front desk.During the trip, I realized he had been in my room. Before I got there. Cause of things he said, the air conditioner was broke in the room and he seemed to know. All of this put me over the edge and really creeped me out.My question is how do I approach him. To say I need to book my own room. I am a female traveling alone and need to be safe. I know he is probably going to get upset and I need to be ready. Plus I’d love to call him out on this points non-sense. He doesn’t need them and I always thought that was a bonus of traveling for work. I think he is trying to take advantage of my inexperience in these situations and I am on to him. Like I’m not stupid dude. I know you can just book a better room for anyone we are hosting. The company can afford it and you are not paying for it.I just want to also say, as creepy as it all sounds. I know he would never come at me sexually. He knows my husband very well and I don’t think would ever cross that line.Any and all advice is so welcome and would be super helpful. Thank you I’m advance.

We have permanent staff as well as on-call. The on-call employees give me their availability and I make everyone's schedule 1 week in advance. Currently, we are understaffed, so we have some on-call staff members working full-time and even overtime if they want it, which is never required even for our full-time staff. A few of our on-call staff actually do a lot of OT because the money is great and the job is not stressful. I manage 2 shelters and if we don't have enough coverage I go in. I am supposed to work 2 days on-site and 3 at home, however since we're so short staffed I am there a lot more, I went in last Saturday and came back Sunday night. I don't expect this of anyone else, I am the manager so I do whatever needs to be done to make sure our clients are taken care of, I just wanted you all to know I am not asking them to do anything I would not do.Now my issue is one of our on-call employees does not want to wants to dictate her own schedule weekly. She found an on-call schedule online and sent it out to the rest of the staff and me. She told me that it would be a way to make sure everyone only works one weekend a month and the others agree with her and are not happy with their schedules. No one has complained to me at all, I have an open-door policy so if they want to talk about anything my office is always open.

I am not worried about losing anyone, the job is easy and very convenient for people who can't work a regular 8-5 schedule. I have spoken with her and she does not care. She told me at this point she is going to create a rotating schedule and present it to everyone.

"Inheriting $ from a defined benefit annuity/pension? Hey guys,I never post and I don’t know much about finance so be easy on me. Around 4 years ago my grandmother passed, leaving myself and 4 siblings with 18% each and her son (my weird uncle) with 10% of the money from this so-called “retirement fund.” Shortly after, each month, a check is direct-deposited into my checking account of a fixed dollar amount. I was initially under the impression this would only last 5 years. However, after inquiring more about the plan through the insurance agency this past month, they are telling me I will receive these payments for life. My brother called separately and they also confirmed that with him.After asking more questions, they began getting aggressive, asking for my dead grandmothers social security number and requiring a death certificate (which, shouldn’t that have already been handled being that I’m receiving payments from her plan, thus implying her death was already legally confirmed ?)When I called her former employer (the owner of the plan) the hr rep explained it was an older type of a defined benefit annuity plan offered prior to 2001, but because my grandmother had started working their in the late 80s, she was grandfathered into that plan for the rest of her tenure. However, the HR rep was under the impression that the payouts lasted only 10 years and that only the company contributed to this plan.Now I’m confused once again.Also, I’ll throw in more info so maybe it’s more helpful.I treat this money as income and pay taxes on it annually. I just received this years 1099-R.Basically, what kind of plan am I dealing with? If it is a life long payment, do I have the option for a lump sum payout after withholding taxes? Frankly, the amount of money I’m receiving monthly isn’t substantial enough to make any dramatic changes (paying off student loan debt, down payment on a condo), but, if I truly am receiving this value for the rest of my life, it’s worth over 100,000 dollars if I live to be average age.At this point I’m speaking gibberish.

I’ve been a victim of blatant sexual harassment and physical advances before and I know this is not the same situation. No one ever handled my previous case seriously or cared for what everyone saw in plain view. Im just looking for a base course of action to take before something might possibly happen again.Context is important. I Work for a construction contractor who is currently employed by a hospital to do some retrofit work. I spend a lot of time in a central operations plant waiting on a contractor that my company employs. I have a workstation/desk in this room where I often converse with hospital employed maintenance. Myself, and them often have good banter. However, the past couple of days they have a new guy working in the plant. He is older, at least 50+ who was sitting next to me for a couple days. At first he seemed nice, and friendly. Then he’d randomly start talking to me while I was working about the most random of topics some sentences not even making sense at all. He has also told me “stories about back in my day” but it seems like he’s trying to convince me he was cool or a ladies man from his “clubbing days”. Then I noticed him on multiple occasions peeking over my shoulder to see what I was doing on my phone. Now when he is supposed to be monitoring a plant that is crucial to the functionality of this hospital.

Like I said, we often have banter but no one really invades each other’s personal space, or asks personal questions, except this guy. I’ve made a point to sit away from him due to his spouting off random shit to me that literally don’t make sense.

A woman once called our office demanding to know the owner of a particular old school building slated for redevelopment. Her 14-year-old daughter had decided to break in with her friends, and had pulled a nearby dumpster over to the fence so she and her friends could climb over it, then broke inside (I’m not sure if they busted down a door or broke a window) and then managed to climb to the roof and stand on top of one of the external pilasters on the facade, subsequently falling down and “cracking her skull.” The mother intended to sue the owners.Now, the building was locked and fully fenced; I’ve driven past it before multiple times. Would the owners still be liable if the 14-year-old pulled over another object to scale the fence and get inside? If the doors and windows were locked, and she broke one to get in?What if the child were younger - say, 9 or 10, or even younger than that. Would the owners be liable for failing to take into consideration that a child could climb the fence if they had enough objects to use as steps, and if, say, the fence was crossed in that way, and then the child got hurt attempting to crawl through a broken window?What if the child was 6 or 7, but was accompanied by a teenager, who assisted the child in getting over the fence and breaking into the building, and the younger child was hurt or killed afterwards whilst on the property?Does it matter if an “attractive nuisance’s” fence is secured by a regular padlock or a more advanced alarm system? Or if, say, a chain-link fence was on a property, a third party damaged it (such as by striking it with a vehicle, opening a hole) and a child crawled through that hole? How soon would a property owner be required to fix the problem? Or would it be argued that the property owner should have taken the possibility of the fence getting damaged into consideration in the first place, and thus they are still completely liable, since they did not take measures to ensure the security on the property in the event of such damage?Lastly, how is an “attractive nuisance” determined? Is the building described above an attractive nuisance? An appliance left out for trash pickup? A car parked in a driveway that the owner is repairing? An open garage?",1
"I had a verbal > written offer demoted in title and reduced by $30k!  I’m so confused and slightly offended lol. I went through 3 interview rounds and confirmed we were aligned on comp 3x throughout the process - including the last call where the CEO made me a verbal offer. The CEO went on about how she loved my experience, thought I was the perfect fit etc.I emailed to follow up on a written offer and the recruiter asked if I’d be open to an offer $30k less than the verbal offer with a reduced title because “the team has a concern regarding your salary expectations given your overall number of years of experience”I plan to decline of course, but what gives? This feels like reverse ageism if that’s a thing lol. I was clearly qualified, aligned on comp, and had the right experience for the role I originally applied to if I made it this far, right? 🙃",0
 need old payslip from current employer for background check but payslip no longer exists I recently received an offer at a new company and am going through the background check process. I didn’t want them to contact my current employer directly so they asked for my W-2s from my time there (July 2019 to now) and my first and last payslip.Here’s the issue though. My company switched to Workday in early 2020. So I was able to get my W-2 for 2019 no problem from the IRS but that first payslip from July 2019 isn’t in Workday. I asked HR and Payroll and Payroll told me I was supposed to download those Payslips before we switched and the old software was retired. They also asked why I wanted it 😅What should I do? Should I just have the background check company contact my current employer? Nothing to hide I just was nervous about them finding out I have a new job lol.Thanks!,0
"How to best dispute what I believe to be an unlawful charge from Airbnb? Here's a summary of the events I put together, I'm looking to file consumer protection or police reports. I'd really appreciate someone telling me if there are other courses of action I can go down concurrently. I've never gotten this in the weeds against a big company before, but I've also never felt this unfairly treated by one before.On Feburary 26, I booked a reservation for a room in East Palo Alto (HM8JFKYHM5) for the dates May 22 to August 13, for a total cost of $4,544.73.This was a reasonable market rate for rooms at this time, booking this far in advance.On April 28, the host canceled, citing the room being damaged. At this point, rooms were significantly more in the area.I was given a coupon from Airbnb for $169.74 on a reservation totaling at least $4109.00.Available listings in the area were, at the time of the host’s cancellation, roughly $6,000 higher total cost for the duration of my stay, an amount not fully covered by the $169.74 coupon.On April 28, I responded by asking the host if there were any alternatives- including sleeping on a couch until the room was repaired, or staying in another lodging until the room was repaired.The host responded by saying he could provide us with a stay that involved 2 separate rooms. I agreed.On April 30, The host then gave me his number and asked me to call him.In this call, the host told me he tried to reinstate the booking with Airbnb, and Airbnb was unable to do this. He proposed that I wire him $1,500 cash “security deposit” to reserve the room. In his proposal, I would still pay the full $4,500, but at least I’d get the room. I mentioned that I thought that may be acceptable, but after hanging up and discussing with others, I believed wiring a stranger $1,500 was too risky.Over text, I explained I was uncomfortable with the situation, and asked if he could simply list the new rooms on Airbnb.The host then sent me links of listings which were ~$1,100 higher than the previous bookings.I explained that I was comfortable with signing a contract, pay-on-arrival, and sending the previously agreed upon rate (where he would still be getting the extra full Airbnb seller and buyer fees). He did not respond to my messages.Panicked about the prospect of not having a property and seeing that the cancellation policy was “Strict”, I booked both rooms- one from May 22 to July 2 (HMQ3BAPZ8P), one from July 2 to August 13 (HM8JFKYHM5).“Strict” cancellation policy is listed as such: To receive a full refund, guests must cancel within 48 hours of booking, and the cancellation must occur at least 14 days before check-inLess than 48 hours after the reservation, I tried to cancel both bookings due to finding another reservation. I was relieved to have a landlord who I was not afraid of (as the host had explicitly used, and potentially created, our housing insecurity to make a profit).Reservation HM8JFKYHM5 was cancelled without issue. However, HMQ3BAPZ8P I was not able to cancel due to Airbnb’s policy on “long term” stays.",1

"Taxing Stocks Annually? If the government was to implement a 2% tax to every stock (payed by the owner of that stock based on its trading value on a annual date or some other metric) would it encourage trading, provide more equitable taxing, and increase the “velocity” of that money that’s currently sitting stagnant in the markets?You could exempt stocks that are part of retirement portfolios (ROTH, Traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b)...etc.).2% seems like a reasonable rate based on average portfolio growth of 10% annually. Stocks that grew less than 2% or decreased in value could also be exempted.",2

 Can HR help with a co-worker slandering my reputation? I am an educator and have seriously considered taking my concerns to HR because a co-worker consistently slanders my character. My immediate supervisor sent her an email to stop after an independent third party approached him with reports of ongoing slander and libel. This same co-worker accused me of sexual harassment last year. HR found no basis in the claim. She is a tenured  teacher so I think I just need to move on to a different school.

"Can I sue for false advertising from a car dealership? (In Maine, USA) I got a flyer in the mail from a dealership about an hour away, attached were three tickets for their ""Sweepstakes"" where you pull up tabs to reveal symbol combos and match the symbol combo to a prize. I won the ""$1000"" prize, the legalese at the bottom seems to confirm that I did as well.I checked the dealership's reviews, and a few of the one star reviews are about getting cheated on that flyer, not receiving the prize advertised, or being outright refused.I'd like to know before I go in; can I sue for false advertising if they don't meet what was stated on the flyer?",1
"Hypothetically speaking, is there ANY circumstance where a city/state/municipality/etc. could inherit (or benefit from) a majority of someone’s will? Region doesn’t matter, could be international but ideally let’s start in the US and work from there.This is a bizarre sounding question I admit, but for context I’m writing two stories revolving around ideas of justice. I often have legal questions pertaining to US law when I’m writing these genres, but in the past I’ve done alright just skirting around the problem so I don’t get into specifics. It might be a better idea to just start asking questions here though, if not for accuracy’s sake then for the sake of keeping my stories in the direction I intended them.So back to the question, I guess it’s as much of an economics question as a legal one. Similar to how many real-life murders are incentivized by lucrative life-insurance policies, is there any way a city/state/country/etc. could benefit from the death of a multi-millionaire or billionaire? What happens if their will is confusing or gibberish? Is that even possible? What if there was a will but a multi-death tragedy like a car crash meant everyone was dead?Okay lots of questions, just rambling to show the limits of my legal understanding. Don’t answer all of those, the one thing I was genuinely curious of was the main question and this: if there was a will but a death meant no one alive to receive, BUT a small portion to go charity, would that charity then receive a larger contribution? As in, there is no one left alive on the will EXCEPT the charity… could they get more? And if no, could a city/state/etc. stand to gain something?I’m not sure what happens if someone dies and there is no will, maybe that’s a better place for me to start researching and not waste people’s time on hypotheticals. But if you’re still reading I appreciate you and I’d like to hear your perspective.",1
" HR propose implementing 360 Review in a chaotic start-up: thoughts? My company (Swiss based with global remote employees; I'm based in Ireland) is a pretty new scale-up that had doubled in size in the past year from about 30 to just over 60. This year we had our first ever performance review, which was a pretty rushed job but whatever. It was the usual questions and then a discussion with your manager.Yesterday, the whole team got an email that next year they will be instituting 360 performance reviews across the whole team. This immediately raised massive red flags for me. There are so many small internal issues/grievances, combined with managers who are the first time in a management role, plus just general organisation chaos due to the massive growth and a completely remote working environment. They haven't confirmed if the information will be used to inform bonuses but I imagine it will be.I'd like to get some perspective on 360 performance reviews. I just feel instinctively that this is a terrible idea, especially in an organisation with poor psychological safety. I'm at a senior enough level that I can raise it and be listened to but I just want to get a sense check on other people's experiences with this type of review.TLDR: What is your experience/view of 360 reviews in a start-up setting?",0
 Bad Interview I just had a phone job interview for a job that I really want at a company I’d love to work for for an amazing job with a great salary.

I’m thinking I could explain that I was feeling under the weather/dealing with a heavy migraine. I’m sure it could not hurt to ask? Any thoughts?,0

" I'm a non-permanent state employee and I'm trying to get permanent status while still taking 3 months of paid family leave in the spring to take care of our foster kids. Oh, and I don't know who my boss is. Act 1: A couple of years ago I took a non-permanent job with the State of Washington. I manage a few pandemic-related programs, 80% of which depended on the state of emergency for their legal authority. Despite the state of emergency ending last month and losing most of my team, my original position's expiration date has been extended time and time again. I've been told that they're trying to pass legislation to allow my programs to run without a state of emergency, and it's been implied that leadership is trying to find a way to keep me around until then so I can run the program. But right now I'm still non-permanent and I don't have any guarantee past my current end-date in March of next year.Act 2: Last January, we took placement of a foster child (our first) and I was able to take 12 weeks of paid family leave through a state program. (My agency is super supportive of people taking leave and it's the norm for folks to take full advantage of any time off they qualify for, which is great.) Three months later (April), our agency asked if we could take our kiddo's medical-needs sibling as well, and so we accepted our second placement. But because the state's paid leave program is built with bio-parents in mind and assumes you can't have two kids just three months apart, I wasn't allowed to take paid family leave for the new child. But one year after the first leave request, I again will be eligible to make a leave request and will qualify for 12 weeks of paid leave for our second child, which must be used within a year of that child's placement. What this means is that I will have 14 weeks in which to use 12 weeks of paid leave for a child who will have been in our care for 9 months. This year has been hell, and I would like to use it all.Entr'acte: My leave can only occur from January to April, and my position is currently set to expire in March. I worry that if I am on leave, they will not extend me again, and I will not be able to advocate for myself.Act 3: Over the past year, turnover in my office has been insane. My original supervisor left while I was on leave, and since then I have had three interim supervisors. The last one was only here a month, and when she left, they didn't even bother to replace her. (Supposedly they are in the hiring process for the permanent replacement, but how slow these things move so I'm not holding my breath.) I'm fortunate to have had incredibly supportive supervisors who I would normally talk to about these things. Because who knows, maybe three months of leave is exactly the kind of stall that helps the agency ""keep me around"" until my program passes through legislation? But there was no hand-off after the last supervisor left so I don't really know who my supervisor is. The automatic org chart that shows up in Outlook says that I report directly to someone who has historically been my boss's boss's boss, but I've only talked to him like twice, and he is WAY too high up in the organization for me to feel comfortable bothering him about... well, anything.I guess I don't have a real clear question here, but I would love any input at all. I'm just not sure where to go on this one.",0

" need accommodations due to disability, but due to specifics of role those aren’t possible- is company likely to be willing or otherwise obligated to find another spot for me? Hi AskHr, I’m currently on FMLA and STD due to a fairly serious/well documented chronic illness. I’m set to return to work on January 12th. I work at a startup that’s killing it atm and has between 200-400 employees. I’ve been here for a little over 1.5 years.As I’m taking the time off to re-assess my health and capabilities, I’m realizing the type of working conditions I need to be successful moving forward career wise are pretty reasonable- namely just flexible working hours and a less psychologically taxing position (in my role now I’m exposed to a lot of dark stuff, like there’s a few former 911 dispatchers on my team to give an idea).These conditions are completely not compatible with my current position. My team runs 24/7 and I do 4, 10-hour shifts/week. It’s the kind of work where if I’m not doing it someone else has to be, so flexible working hours are not possible by nature of the position. And it would be impossible to remove the darker psychological parts of the job.So I’m basically realizing I can’t/shouldn’t continue in my current position, but I really would like to stay with my current company if at all possible- what should I do? There are a few people on my team who work non-shift hours, but they are mostly leadership level. I don’t expect them to have to accommodate me when I can’t do the basic functions of the role I’ve been performing and was hired for, though I plan to have a talk with them soon.Another idea I had is talking to HR about shifting to another position within the company. My team does a very distinct function than what the rest of the company does. Even before my health took a big turn for the worse, I was considering talking to my boss about getting some exposure to our sales team and their process. In my 2 previous roles I could have been a customer to my company’s product, and I have 3.5 years experience in this business now and feel I could really help with my contacts and understanding customer needs. I’ve also always just thought I’d be good at sales. I’m early in my career and happy to take an entry level role in sales or something else like business development, customer success, etc.So questions for the HR rockstars- what would be the best way to go about communicating the above? Does my company have any obligation to try to accommodate me? I understand if not as like I’ve said I cannot perform my current role, no reasonable accommodation is possible. Any/all advice would be appreciated here, including if you think it would just be better for me to seek employment elsewhere. I do know my company is fairly obsessed with employee retention- it was one of this year’s top goals.",0
"Why is the US allowed to be in so much debt? It's always blown my mind how much debt the US is in. My country, Australia, is approaching $850b and a lot of people are concerned for the economy. Is there a limit for how much debt a country can be in?",2
"Case filed against me by doctor and their attorney even after I paid my debt in Virginia I got a demand letter in the mail a week ago. I called up the plaintiff because I knew them from a prior medical visit. Asked them what was going on, long story short they sent bills to the address but not my apartment number and never heard from me. I asked for my itemized bill and paid it right then and there. I have my receipt, my itemized bill, and credit card statement showing the doctors practice.While this is happening, I see no court date on the court site with the date that was posted on the demand letter.Fast forward to today, and I get another letter with the demand letter being filled out and showing signatures to appear in court on a specific date by the same plaintiff. I check the court records and sure enough I have a court case for ""motion for judgement"".I immediately call the doctor, they say it's been paid already. So I call the lawyers office next and they say the same thing. (I've recorded both of these conversations as well). I ask them why a case was still made two days after my payment was posted. They state ""you can ignore that notice, it came in late and we've deemed the debt settled. You do not need to appear in court, the lawyer (plaintiffs lawyer) will inform the judge it was nullified"". I don't believe them so I ask for a letter stating what was discussed and that my debt is settled, and to send me email confirmation as well. I did not get an email yet, and I'm doubtful I'll see the letter by Monday.

"Employee funded health insurance (IL) (IL)Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but long story short….I currently work a government job that offers health insurance that is “self funded” meaning all of the employees insurance premiums along with the employers contributions go into a fund that finances the our medical expenditures throughout the year.It’s managed by a third party insurance company and it’s set up like a typical health insurance plan (deductibles, 80/20, max out of pocket, etc..) Coverage / deductibles are mediocre at best.Every year it seems like our premiums are going up, which is to be expected with the rising cost of healthcare and all, but this year, they skyrocketed (30%-125%) depending on the plan.The county board has a history of borrowing money from the employee funded health fund to finance unexpected projects or expenditures.  They say they pay back the money, but haven’t FOIA’d the documents to prove it.Is it legal for the county board, who’s members aren’t even covered by the employee funded health plan, to use the money for other projects or expenses?  Are their statues in place that regulate the use of these types of funds?Thanks",1
"Does the law allow someone to keep a company laptop sent from a company they don't work for? Title is confusing, but here's the gist:I work for an IT consultation company (and MSP) and we have a client that was working with a person to potentially hire them for remote work. The person lives in another state and they were working their way through the hiring process. The person backed out before the end of the process and decided they don't want to work for the company, but the company had already shipped them a laptop. It was signed for and received a couple weeks ago, but the person has gone completely no-contact. Won't respond to calls or emails or anything to attempt to retrieve the laptop.My coworkers believe this falls under the ""you're not obligated to return anything a company sends you unasked for"" - the one that covers you if, say, Amazon sends you a package you didn't ask for or someone tries to send you a product and then charge you for it unrequested.I believe that doesn't apply, as it seems to only apply to merchandise and items where the expectation is a purchase. This is someone who was issued a company laptop but backed out of working for the company before docs were signed. My coworkers argument is that the rule still applies here because it's not something this person asked for (since she doesn't work there) and received it unrequested.Any insight on this or how it could play out?Edit to add: as mentioned this is also across state lines so that may play a factor as well.",1
" Does Denying a Large Raise Request Poison the Well? Is there ever any worry when someone proposes a significant raise that the well, so to speak, is poisoned if that request is denied?For background: I work in a mid-managerial marketing and business development role in a very successful, medium-sized law firm. The role was actually created specifically with me in mind. However, I had just lost my job at a previous firm and, for risk of inadvertently pricing myself out of my own job, I low-balled myself. I think I have since proved the value of my position at my firm, but now feel like it is a drastically underpaid position - making considerably less than a first-year associate.I've done some industry research as to what someone in similar positions across the US makes, but those seem extraordinarily high, especially in light of how the 2 people whom I directly report to (executive non-legal positions) live. If they are making more than the research for my position says, then they certainly don't live like it (not to say that's a bad thing).I'm proposing a raise somewhere in the 50% range of what I'm currently making, which I know is extremely large. I'm worried that that may be out of line with what my managers are making and that they will be worried that such a large raise request (and their rejection, presumably) would indicate my level of dissatisfaction there. To be clear, I'm very happy here from a cultural and work standpoint. I just think my value to the firm, in billable time generated, is significantly more than what I am currently being paid, according to my estimates.",0
" I’m not sure if this is harassment or not, should I bring it up to my manager? I was redirected here, so I’m basically crossposting this with some added details.Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. For context, I moved here from another country alone for work about a year ago. I got assigned a mentor as I’m a junior in my field. I’m also FTM, but I’m not out at work yet, so they know me as a woman. I feel like that’s important to mention considering the context.When I first got to work, there wasn’t much work that me and my mentor could do together, as I was working on things that were out of his expertise. He kept on trying to meet up with me, or arranging meetings. I understand that’s pretty normal for mentors, so I didn’t think much of it. However, he started to get more forceful about it, and would visibly seem quite annoyed when I refused them. He insisted on them happening at some point, despite that the things I was working on, he was unable to help with. Nevertheless, I let it go, because I just figured he was trying to help.His behaviour has got more erratic, though. We have an office that lots of people take off shoes, as it’s pretty normal to take off shows when you go indoors. One of the times I went to the office, he got super close to me and started rubbing his bare foot? Which I don’t need to explain how uncomfortable that made me lol, but he also might just have been doing it absentmindedly. He’s still insisting on talking to me about nothing to do with work, which is fine, but given previous behaviours it honestly makes me very uncomfortable.Now I have taken up a task that will require some help. I put my name down for it, and I’ve just found out, so has he. I get that’s normal for mentors to do, but I just feel kinda cornered into working with him. He hasn’t helped me at all since getting here, and in fact has made many aspects more confusing. I’ve communicated that his way of working doesn’t seem to be helping, but he’s insistent.I get along with the rest of my team perfectly fine, but this guy is honestly really affecting my working life. I understand that he’s a mentor that’s maybe concerned that he hasn’t been able to actually help me much thus far, but he is extremely overbearing. The foot rubbing incident honestly creeped me out, especially since he did it right next to me and was looking at me. It didn’t feel sexual, but I’m not 100% sure. I’m concerned that bringing it up will make a whole thing out of nothing, so I haven’t. However, working with this guy is making me genuinely not want to go to work, and I’m actively looking elsewhere.Another thing that’s stopping me from going to my manager already is he honestly seems like he might have some learning difficulties that he doesn’t understand social queues. I know that doesn’t excuse what he’s been doing, but it might explain things.Now for what the title is: is this harassment? Should I bring it up with my manager? Or should I just accept it and move on?EDIT: To add, this is not my first mentor in this field, so I have an idea about how things work and don’t work for me. I also do as he says most of the time to save myself from any sort of conflict, but I’m getting to the end of my tether and would like to figure out the best way forward. Let me know if you need any more info.",0
"What does owning equity mean? Understanding its meaning and usage. I just want to check my understanding of what people mean when they say have have equity.So equity financing is when you for example sell company shares for money. This financing is obtained by utilizing the equity we own and turning it into cash. Company shares are an asset that's usually called by equity, because: 1. It's value is not certain; or 2. It's value can decrease from the original; If the value of a share decreased, that could result in a loss to the buyer. Specifically the loss from first buying the share, and then selling it at a lower price.Or maybe the reason I presented is wrong. What truly characterizes an asset as equity is that there is some associated negative-value to it, maybe you call this a liability. An example of assets that have some associated truly negative cost would be: 1. The selling of a put option. 2. A house.

" Asking HR for a schedule change due to my mental health Hello everyone, I first wanted to apologize if this was not the appropriate reddit page to post this is in. I have been working for Blue Cross Blue Shield call center for 2 years now and every 6 months they change your shift schedule to whatever they please and find fit at the time, which is annoying as this could really mess up with people’s outside of work lifestyle. They scheduled me 4 day weeks working 10 hours daily. We are in Annual Enrollment Period and the calls are back to back to back to back my entire shift. During Annual enrollment they want us to work 2 mandatory hours of OT a day because of all the calls. That means I have been working 12 hour shifts. This has really messed with my mental health as I am feeling extremely depressed and anxious and absolutely dread having to take calls. I am the only one in my team that got stuck with a 4x10 schedule out of 35 people, why? I have no idea, but I knew I would hate it. My direct manager states she can not do nothing about it and I have to reach out to HR. I really want to eeach out to HR about this but I have no idea wht to say. I do not want to lose my job, i want to work a regular 5x8 schedule as I feel I can manage that a lot better but Im not sure how to start. The constant calls have left me in a state of fight or flight it has just become unbereable and im crying writing this post about to take my first call of the day in 10 minutes.",0

" Lowballed myself in HR conversation, how do I recover? A bit of context: I've been approached by a recruiter to apply for a role similar to the one I'm in now at a different company. During our initial call the recruiter asked me what salary I'd be looking for and I named a salary which is approx. 10% over what I'm making at the moment (worth noting my current company pays below market level). The job ad includes a “salary band” but it’s not explicit (e.g. band 6) so it’s not very helpful. I've been invited to interview officially and only now (sadly) decided to look up the average salary for the role on Glassdoor. It seems the starting band for this role at this company is, on average, about 10k over what I asked for. So I suppose I’m wondering two things:If they have a set salary band for this role and Glassdoor is roughly accurate, could they pay me under said salary band because I asked for less?How do I recover from this? Should I:speak to the recruiter ahead of the interview and mention I've done more research and realised I'm undervaluing myself and ask them to confirm what the salary band is? (note they are internal talent acquisition so don’t think they get commission from this) orwait for an offer first if the interview is positive and negotiate at that pointI'm finding it difficult to decide on next steps so any advice is welcome. Thanks!",0

" Laid Off….Did I receive the correct amount of notice? I’m a Full-time employee working for a global publicly traded consulting firm out of the New York City office. I currently hold a position within corporate functions-recruiting and have been employed with them for 1.75years. I was given notice 3 weeks ago that I was being laid off due to restructuring of the group and was repeatedly told it was not due to performance( my performance review just a few months ago was great and I didn’t receive any negative feedback).I was given 45 days notice. There were others who were also laid off, either due to performance or bc of the restructuring across the US. What really bothered me about this was we were extremely busy all year, I was covering another role for 6 months along with working my own role and they finally filled the position about 3 months ago and there have been a few new additions to the team-replacements for those who’ve left, a few weeks before my notice was given (these new additions were internal moves. These employees are a level lower than me but doing the same job)After doing some research on the WARN act for NYC, I’ve come to find out that I should have been given 90 day notice just for being laid-off /+being located in NYC. Could anyone confirm if this is true or are there details I’m not considering that would be in favor of my employer giving me 45 days instead of 90?I want to approach my HR department with the request for additional time but want to be sure I have the proper info before asking.Happy to provide any additional details to assist with advice.

"My (paid) internship put us on hiatus and won’t tell us when/if we’re coming back. Are they allowed to do this? I (20m) started working as a paid intern at a startup on June 6th earlier this summer. Although I had other options, I accepted this position because it offered a large pay. There are two other college aged interns working with me. During the middle of our third week, our supervisor announced that the company has been purchased and we will be going on an (unpaid) hiatus until July 15 and we would receive a lump payment for our first three weeks on July 1st (as we were originally going to be paid bi-weekly). The other interns and I weren’t happy, but we accepted it as it was only 3 weeks. July 1st comes and goes and we haven’t been paid, which the company says is because they had to freeze their payroll until July 15 as they transfer to the other company. We still haven’t been told what company we were bought by, as they said they haven’t “publicly announced it yet” even though we all had to sign NDAs. We had a meeting on July 8th for them to update us on how everything is going, and it was during this meeting that the head of HR said that our supervisor was in an accident and they weren’t sure if she would be returning this summer, which means we wouldn’t be able to return either. At this point we still haven’t been paid and they won’t give us a concrete answer on when/if we’re coming back. I feel as if they’re trying to take advantage of us because we students, are they allowed to just leave us out to dry like this? It’s too late in the summer to find another internship and we’ve already been out of work for three weeks at this point. None of us are really informed about our rights as workers; if need be, could we have a legal case against them seeking compensation for the weeks we were promised to be working?",1

"Are estates responsible for upkeep of property? Who (if anyone) would be responsible for upkeep on a condemned property with an occupant. There is a structure near a place we are renting for the month. No running water, no electricity, the structure is over grown inside and out with weeds, the massive holes in the roof are covered with cardboard or tarps. The occupant is in jail for the next two weeks on harassment charges. I guess the nextdoor neighbors got tired of him pouring his pee bottles out in their yard, among other disgusting things. I’m renting a home nearby and wasn’t aware a person lived in this building until I saw police talking with him. I asked around and apparently the property is in a trust which has made all payments for taxes, trash pickup, etc. My question is, if the house has already been condemned (the notice is plastered to a window) who is responsible for it? Will the Estate need to bring it up to code or pay to have it torn down? If the neighbors filed a civil suit over harassment would it be against the occupant or the estate? Why would the state continue to collect taxes, knowing this man’s life is at risk by continuing to live there? This seems incredibly over complicated. I’m sure there’s tons of red tape but obviously the Estate Lawyer doesn’t care he’s living in squalor, the neighbors have had enough and this man definitely needs help.",1

I went ahead and deposited it, and I figured if anything was wrong with it my employer would let me know pretty quickly. My boss is the owner of the restaurant and is frequently away, so we don't often communicate unless it's necessary.

"Litter of Puppies, Now Adults, Now Health Concerns 10 years ago my dog (small breed) had puppies, I kept one of the puppies from that litter and gave away (free) the remainder to then friends and family. Some of those “friends” are no longer friendly. The puppy I kept, now 10, may have a heart condition. We are awaiting the final results.

"Lawyer ""objecting to himself"" in Depp case I keep seeing people laughing at Amber Heard's lawyer objecting to his own question, but the question asked was ""did you know"" and the witness answered ""Dr Kipper told me.""

"Did my husband violate his restraining order? My husband currently has a restraining order with peaceful contact with his 14yr old daughter. He has barely seen her in the last 6 years because the mom doesnt want her to have contact to get his side of things and to lose child support.  Now things are being said from his daughter that don't line up with the truth.  She claims that there was horrible abuse to the mom that she will never forgive her dad for which didn't happen. Before Christmas she contacted my 12 yr old daughter and said she randomly wanted to come by with her friend to visit the pets that she hasn't seen in forever and my 2 daughters. She was told when she came to the door by my daughter that her dad was going to be home any minute and that I told them that they should stay on the porch.  She came into the house anyway and we have this saved on the doorbell camera video. She was there 5 min before my husband came home.  His daughter ran to him and hugged him for a long time and they hung out for 45 min while he showed her around. Her friend had to leave and as they were leaving the cameras recorded her talking to her dad and hugging him. We decided to contact the mother through talking parents and she said she was aware of the visit after the fact but didn't know the dad was there. When we brought up the idea of making another visit, the mom said she had a very long talk to her daughter about how her dad could be in serious trouble if someone reports the visit because of the restraining order and how he could go to jail. Now the mom says that his daughter is not interested in having a relationship with him and he should leave her alone. Is this correct? Is he possibly in violation of she came by of her own will and we have it on video that it was peaceful?",1

"I feel like I’ve really screwed up Please, I need some legal advice. I was supposed to pet sit this puppy but now I’m starting to believe I was scammed. And now I’m freaking out. I think I got a fake check that I deposited unknowingly. For a lot of money. And since the funds haven’t been made even partially available yet, the person I received the check from wants to cancel and send a smaller amount.Context: I saw this ad to dog sit a chihuahua on Facebook. I needed some cash due to being between jobs and they were willing to pay a lot for an extended period of time. Then I discovered they were out of town for work and would need to send the puppy over to stay at my home. They showed me a screenshot of their account and they definitely had the funds. The first red flag though is when he said he’d send me money to pay the delivery service. He said it’s because my name is there to receive the puppy, which means I’m the one ordering the service. Okay, whatever. But I get the check, which is way more than I thought it would be, and I deposit it via mobile yesterday. But today the funds aren’t even partially available. That’s red flag 2, I feel that it’s being put on hold but the person who sent the check seems eager to cancel it to send a smaller (still large) amount. Red flag 3, I keep stating I want to talk with my bank and he keeps trying to rush the cancelation telling me that he knows what he’s doing.So then I take a closer look at the check and start doing my own research and I think the check is printed and fake! And that’s really scaring me because I’m just starting to get my life in order and I feel like it’s all about to be destroyed because of money I can’t pay leaving my account and being held accountable for fraudulent activity I wasn’t aware of. Im in a panic. Even if the funds came through, I am not going to use them out of fear of the canceling. But even if I don’t use them, am I still liable to pay it back if the check finally bounces? Am I going to face legal consequences and tons of fees because I was scammed? I just started a good paying job, I have to care for my disabled fiancé and our pets/his service dog in training, I have to pay my rent, my bills, etc. I was just beginning my life. Im scared that this might end it faster than I can blink…. What do I do? Please help",1
"Can I sue JUUL? I started using that as a never smoker before. Used for one and a half months and it damaged my tonsil and made it become chronically inflamed and because of that, it gave me a horrible dry mouth and now I’m suffering with dental and gum damage after 3 years of having this. Getting my tonsils taken out next month but this journey has been so awful. I’ve thought about ending my life because of the pain of this and I now have pretty bad depression because of this. It really affected my life and I’m certain using this device caused it. I remember the day this started clearly. It’s like my Indio had enough and felt hot all of a sudden and too much nicotine caused it to become dry and irritated or something and it must have burned or irritated my left tonsil because I used it in my left side and the inflammation of that tonsil caused altered saliva flow and made my mouth incredibly dry and painful for years. It took me a long time to find doctors in my area and get real answers and even now no one is sure of what happened but I remember the thing just damaged that tonsil and made it become bad. I’ve suffered from like 5 cases of tonsillitis since this and have never had that before in my life. Just looking at my gum damage makes me so sad and depressed.",1
"HOA Dispute My HOA (condo complex) recently held an unannounced vote to remove dumpsters from the community in favor of trash cans with curbside pickups. The problem is that there was no planning for storage of the new trash cans for the upstairs units. The layouts of the condos are you walk in the front door, and there is an 8’ long x 4’ wide space to the left when the front door is open leading to the stairs that take you into the living room/kitchen. In speaking with the HOA, they have said that all downstairs units can store their bins in the back, however the upstairs units are required to keep outdoor trash cans in this entry way area. The width of the trash cans is 29.75” leaving residents just an 18” gap to get into their homes. The HOAs response so far has been if you don’t like it you can leave the community (residents own the units). The majority of units are occupied by elderly individuals with mobility problems and while not only does leaving trash in the entry way of a home welcome pests carrying disease, but it also impedes those trying to get in and out of their units. Do I have a case here, and is it worth procuring a lawyer? I am dumbfounded that the HOA thinks it is remotely acceptable to force residents to store trash bins in the entryway of our homes more that halving the space.",1

He had the authority to reject my application and he did it. I understood his opinions on me and proceeded to apply without informing(to reduce his influence) for a entry level position(internal vacancy) that is related to my study. This position was not in anyway related to him so he didn't have access to my application. But he came to know it from my co-worker and now he is threatening to not extend my contract because of this and he said he will contact the recruiting HR and tell him/her that I am not a good profile. I have tried to talk with him before about my motives but he has decided that I am not capable of doing any other job without even knowing my capabilities and qualifications. He said that I am not working hard and I asked him if he had proof of it and he replied that if I had any proof that I worked hard(there is no monitoring system).

"Missing cost basis for parent's investment My parents had a long-term advisor who they have been paying a percentage of assets under management for decades. Their returns were terrible and their fee was high. I offered to move their assets into my advisor's management and cover the fees now that they're retired and dad's in long-term care.

" Question about an incident at work I work for a company that is virtual and I was hired as a Texas employee but their headquarters is in a different state.There was recently an issue where I was supposed to be delivered company equipment. It was delivered to my old address so I had somebody return it. The company told me they would send me a new package at my address.I was informed the company did not have a record of the return because the label was not scanned. They asked me for the tracking number but we didn’t have the receipt anymore from when we returned it months ago. I asked my family member who returned if they had the receipt and I asked my other family member to call the post office (I do not have international calls)They also asked me if I received the new package. I did not receive a package, I did not receive a delivery notice, and I also did not receive a phone call. I never got the tracking information for it either. I assumed that they probably just wanted to confirm the return before sending me new equipment, because so much time had passed that I would’ve definitely received a new computer if they sent it out to me.Recently, I had a meeting with a supervisor. I wasn’t allowed to work that day until the issue was sorted out. They IMPLIED and ALLUDED to many things so they could say whatever they wanted to me and I would not be able to complain, as they did not outright accuse me. I felt extremely uncomfortable either way.They referred to the return of the package in the conditional tense, as if we didn’t actually return it (they also said “maybe they just told you they did”), they threatened me with the cost of recovering the equipment, they told me my email responses were vague (because I answered using only the information that was available to me at the time- they pulled up the new delivery courier and tracking number in the same meeting which was the very first time I was hearing about it, and told me there was a delivery attempt. I had no idea when they asked me.)They were also very condescending to me. They said I wasn’t taking the situation seriously and I was not actively working to solve it. They then gave me a deadline to “provide some answers”For the new package: I entered the very same information w the tracking that was given to me and I saw in two minutes that it was returned to the warehouse. I called and confirmed with the courier.For the return: I had my family member phone the post office again and they said they could see where the package was if I contacted my company and asked them for the original tracking details on the prepaid label. I phoned the supervisor who seemed inconvenienced and they contacted the appropriate authorities. This whole time I was under the impression I’d be fired or fined by that deadline, so I don’t appreciate that they also left me in the dark while waiting for that response.All they said the very next day was “yeah it was returned.” Not a single apology. They sent me two emails and a text right after, asking for me to respond to the emails.",0

"Net Working Capital - Valuation Question Hi all -




I was wondering about NWC's impact on company valuation. I'm at a more accounting-based internship right now, and learned that when firms bid on a company, they submit a letter of intent that includes a NWC ""peg"". On close, the seller owes the buyer any decrease in NWC from this ""peg"" (conversely, the buyer would owe the seller any increase in NWC from the ""peg"").




This means inherently that the valuation of a company within the period from LOI to close goes up with an increase in NWC. However, basic finance dictates that an increase in NWC reduces free cash flow and causes the valuation to go down.




Why is there the opposite effect on valuation from LOI - Close and pre-LOI, and if not, why?",2
" Is my boss sexually harassing me? I have been at my current job for a little over a year. This all started a couple of months after I started my job. I think my boss is sexually harassing me. It started with him asking if I was up for a ""challenge"" with him. He has been asking me to help him with picking out women's items for himself. I was always uncomfortable with it but never felt like I could say no or tell him I was uncomfortable. Even when he asked. I didn't feel like I could because he's my boss and I also thought he could have issues with his gender identity. I wanted to be supportive of an older man who didn't know how to express that. He has given me his personal money to buy holiday decor for the office and asked specifically for ""cute"" and ""girly"" things for his office as part of our ""challenge"". He has asked for my opinion on women's hairstyles he wants to try and if I thought it was too obviously feminine. He has asked me to pick out women's shoes for him before and tried to buy us matching women's shoes. He will wear androgynous clothing and ask if I noticed or what I thought of them. The entire time this has been happening I was uncomfortable and it felt... off but I didn't know how tell him that. He has asked me to buy girly office supplies for him too. All of these have happened repeatedly for about a year now. He is incredibly petty and unpleasant to people who he does not like. I also did not want to come across as transphobic. I truly do not care if people wear clothes not designed for their gender. I support and affirm the trans community. Recently I found out he has done the same and more to two other female co-workers. One he sent photos to of him in women's clothing, of lingerie asking which he should buy and wear, and he also changed into women's clothing for her with her in his office without telling her what was happening or for her consent.For better context, we work at a university. I have the lowest position on campus and he has one of the highest. When he found out I'm taking a class that gets out late he offered to let me stay the night at his house so I didn't have to make my hour commute back. It seems nice on the surface but given everything else, it seems not appropriate either.Am I being sexually harassed and do I have enough to go to HR? If they do nothing about it but he finds out then I still have to work directly for him.",0

 How to decrease NO SHOW rate of first interviews? I am a manager for a small medical office. I find that I could schedule 10 interviews for a given day and only about 2-3 people would actually show up.Is this normal? Or is there some room for improvement?The two positions that I am looking to fill are front desk receptionist and a medical assistant.I post the job openings on indeed and then call/text each candidate that I am interested in. I realized that people don't really read the job descriptions so I would often waste time with pointless interviews.To mediate this I started doing during the first call is ask them a couple of questions.Are you okay with the posted salary range?Are you okay with commuting to our location?Do you speak Spanish and able to translate to and from?Are you okay with the times we are open?I also tell them briefly about the clinic and the daily duties.After which I give the applicant the opportunity to ask any questions they might have.If they answered YES to all of the above questions I ask if they would be interested to coming for an interview. Interview would get scheduled.,0

" The company I work for just sent notice that NJ employees will lose 40hrs of PTO to accommodate the mandatory sick time we accrue due to NJ laws, is this legal? I work for a retail company with locations all over the US. I'm a FT, hourly employee in a retail store. NJ requires employers to provide up to 40 hours of sick leave per year. This is accumulated 1 hour of sick leave per 30 hours worked. The company sent notice to all employees in my state and some select other locations with the same law stating that we will have 40 hours of PTO taken from our annual PTO to essentially cover the 40 hours we get in sick leave. Their justification is to make it fair for the employees not getting the sick leave hours, I guess.Is this legal? Sick time isn't rolled over, and doesn't get applied in a lump sum at the start of the year, unlike PTO. So I  have 88 hours of PTO every year, but they will be taking 40 of that, leaving me with 48 hours of PTO. Then I have to wait for my sick leave to build through the year so I may earn back the 40 I lost. They say the sick leave can be used for any reason, implying it could be used for vacation instead of it's intended purpose of being used for sick leave.",0

"Executor withholding information regarding my inheritance? Hello reddit! I have a question regarding myself as a beneficiary to my grandfather’s estate. (I am in ONTARIO CANADA) My grandfather died a year ago and made a relative the executor to this estate. Myself and 3 cousins (4 people total including myself) are beneficiaries to this property.The relative who was executor to this estate had not shown any beneficiaries of any of the estate the will. They basically mentioned to me in passing that I was 1/4 beneficiaries to the property in question and that it was being sold.I have three questions regarding this.The property sold a week + ago and I have heard nothing. Is there a deadline for when I shall receive my portion of the proceeds from the sale?What action can I take/ what would my next step be, if they do not pay me in a timely manner?Will proceeds of the sale be used to pay land transfer tax and other fees? I was told by the executor that a large chunk of my profit will be taken for this purpose. How can I know I am receiving the correct amount of money?I asked very gently today about the property in question as I noticed it had sold. The executor responded “yes it sold.” And did not give any more information..I have not been prying or asking because other beneficiaries of my grandfather’s other properties were asking questions and it destroyed their relationship with the executor.. I feel that I am unreasonably being left in the dark. I have an excellent relationship with the executor and now, upon asking the first question ever regarding my inheritance, they have become very short with me.I am young and inexperienced with this so any information is greatly appreciated…",1

It’s not technically in my job anymore to drive retail customers.

When I reminded boss of this and said it made me uncomfortable to drive this guy alone given his history my boss said he didn’t care and to do it.Luckily a male coworker stepped in to give the guy a ride.But I feel like after explicitly stating the situation made me uncomfortable then I shouldn’t have been told to still do it.

" Language Discrimination My employer (a factory) utilizes a temp agency that sends Central/South American workers that are here in the US, usually out of TX and FL, to us because we can't find enough people up here to work.At the start, almost none of them spoke any English, which made training them all extremely hard because we had so few bi-lingual Spanish speakers.

One of them had his brother-in-law come last week through the temp agency. He made it through orientation, and then on Saturday was informed he would be let go for not speaking English.Is that legal? How does an employer that already has Spanish-only speaking people working through the temp agency turn away people for not speaking English?

" Should I go to HR a file a complaint about my Manger? I am having many problems with my manager, and I am unsure if it is in my head or if she is trying to get me to quit my job. Here are some recent examples of thingsI was supposed to attend a meeting where I was the lead in finalizing some documents. Right before the meeting, she told me due to competing priorities, she would go to the meeting and take it over, and I could not go to the meeting and focus on other tasks. She didn't ask me for any background and just took over. This is highly disruptive, and I have no idea what she is doing.She demanded that I move my approved vacation (Friday) so we could go over a presentation. I asked her if we could do it Thursday because I already have a plan. She said her schedule was booked for Thursday, so I must do it on Friday. She took a last-minute vacation Monday and Tuesday, and I have to work extra time to accommodate her. But now I have to cancel my plan for her?We have an unlimited PTO policy, so if I don't use I will lose it. I worked so hard this year and didn't take any vacation. So I asked her if I could take some Friday off. She agreed but later demanded that I must be aviable (via slack, phone, and email) when I am needed before she can approve my vacation.She is micromanaging me and demands everything go through her so she can pick and choose which item she can get credit on. She often took credit for the work I did without mentioning my contribution.When I asked if I could create a RACI (responsibility matrix) so we can know our responsibility and better support each other. She said no because I kept asking for it, ""I was not fit for the company's flexible start-up  environment.""Exclude me from several important meetings with the leadership group. Even I need to attend the meeting for my project. Her reason is that she will relay the information messages to me, but sometimes I am the last to know, and it disrupts my work.I did try to bring some of these issues up at our 1:1 and ask if she could better support me. She always turns it around as my problems. I am trying to manage her, or I am not a good fit. At this point, I don't want to bring it up anymore. I am afraid she is planning to get rid of me soon. She just hired another person starting next week.TLDR: I am afraid my manager is trying to get rid of or push me out.

" Coworker is abusing PTO, don’t want to snitch so what can I do? I work at a  large mineral mine, and in my role there I run a piece of machinery with two other coworkers. The crews are very large and we mostly operate outside the normal day to day production that you would expect a mine. The crew that we work with are in a rotating schedule and ours is a Mon - Thurs straight days job. I feel this is someone pertinent to the situation, we don’t always see our direct supervisor, we more often deal with engineers, geologist and geotechs.So when one of the group has to take time off we have a running group chat to keep in contact with one and other and make sure we have the means to get to work. We have a company truck that we share out of the three, two of live in town that is about 50 miles from work and the other coworker lives in a smaller town that is on the way to work that is about 20 miles in that direction.Here is my issue. My coworkers that lives in the town closer to work is abusing his PTO. We are expected to communicate with the on duty supervisor and advise him of our absence and adjust one’s own time card thru a program at work. Honor system, more or less. Since we don’t always see our supervisor he assumes we have reported to work and all is in order. My coworker has, on several occasion not called a supervisor when the time is being taken off, or adjusted his time according. I can’t personally verify these claims but going off of years of services and that we work 12 hour days, your pto goes quick. He also bragged to our other coworker that he got a whole week off while being paid like he was at work. He has taken no less that four weeks off this year and that’s at 48 hours a week. That’s at the very least 192 hours this year. His years of service is under three years and the company gives those people in those years of service 120 hours a year that is accrued every two weeks in increments of 4.5 in his case.My dilema is that he wants wants to take another week off near that end of this year, and I can only assume that he wants to take it off and still get paid. What can I do to bring this to the attention of the proper people with out being a snitch. I’m posting this on 10/25 and he pull crap yesterday and I made it point to see my supervisors several times thru our my shift to see if they noticed his missing and had no luck. He even asked my coworker our supervisor saw us yesterday while he was absent. I’m frustrated because he gets away with this nonsense.

"Firework Lawn Fire (minor) I live in Indianapolis and was setting off fireworks tonight (July 2nd) during the legal set firework timeframe set by the city. We set up in the center of the cul-de-sac circle since that was the largest amount of pavement in the cul-de-sac. We didn't invite any of our neighbors, but we did let the ones we knew that we were going to have our family holiday on the 2nd. We started lighting off our fireworks and a few neighbors came out to see what was going on. One lady came out and watched for 5-10 minutes and then went back inside. Saying nothing. Another neighbor's children were watching from the window. No one was complaining.Then the accident happened. One of our larger fireworks sparks hit a stack of 3 multi-shot fountain squares. I went to try to get the out of the way, but it was too late. 2 of fuses were off and running. Well the one on top was knocked over by the one it was sitting on top of. This caused it to start shooting out the projectiles to the side. My family started darting around to ensure the young children were out of the way and safe. 90% of the sparks stayed in the cul-de-sac as expected, but 2 sparks hit 2 different neighbors lawns and ignited. One has a burn area of 2x6 and 1x4 and the other a patch of 3x7. We put the fires out very quickly. Needless to say the neighbors affected were not very happy. They were honestly very belligerent and today you would have said they were acting like Karens. I, of course apologized and tried to explain what had happened, but they just wanted to yell and cuss at my family (2 and up children present) and this set off my children and their spouses. Luckily it did not come to blows. One of the neighbors called the police about us letting off the fireworks; even though a release was made letting people know it was legal and not to waste the police's time. They did not come.All of that to come to my legal question; what am I responsible for and what upper ground do they have? I would be willing to pay for sod to be placed in the areas burnt, but I won't pay for a whole yard treatment. Anyone's fireworks could have done the same thing. We were just the unlucky family that caused it this time. Everyone knows that fireworks will be going off for the next 2 weeks and that they need to keep their grass moist to prevent anything. Hell even the city's fireworks could have caused their fire. I'm not trying to wiggle out of the sod, but I don't want to have to deal with redoing their whole front your or worse a lawsuit.Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",1

" Performance Review I recently got my performance review and my manager rated me a 2/5. This is completely shocking to me considering my last evaluation was “meets standards” just a few months ago. The manager used extremely vague summaries that provided no information or examples about my performance. In one section she wrote that I haven’t helped my team and it’s been mentioned to her. This is the first time I’ve heard this and don’t believe it’s true at all. I take a lot of pride in building strong internal relationships and work hard to make sure my stakeholders are happy. She then goes on to say that I’m not managing our content strategy but she owns that and assigns the projects to the team. There are 3 other people responsible for content. The examples she cited mention work owned by another person on the team. The feedback has left me feeling like I don’t belong here because it doesn’t matter how hard I work, what I do, I’ll always get the blame for whatever goes wrong…I guess I’d like to know if it’s worth having an addendum added to the feedback through HR. I have emails and slack messages that support me and I honestly feel like this review was not accurate at all.",0
"Is this a viable way to avoid interest? So, I bought a laptop last year through Very, using a 'buy now pay 12-months later' scheme. I have £300 left to pay in the next two months before interest is added because the 12-month period has ended. Unfortunately, due to COVID, I've been unemployed and can't afford to make that payment.So, I've had an idea, please tell me if it's stupid, please. I know I'll be in a better position in the next six months but want to avoid interest. So, I was thinking, would buying another product (valued around £300) using the 'Buy now, pay 12-months later', then selling that product for cash to cover the original item I bought, thus avoiding the interest, be a good solution?Leaving me with the same amount to pay back but with more time to pay it back. Does this make sense? Just to add, should I not make the payment, the interest is £200. Also, I'm not looking to eraze the debt, just off-set the payment dates.",2

" Broke my knee at work, my manager didn’t submit an accident report I’ve (48f) worked at this company for 20 years, and two years ago, I broke my leg while on the job. It was well known that this happened at work, in fact two people saw when it happened and helped me. My manager didn’t write up an accident report, and I didn’t think any of it at the time, as I have good healthcare and wasn’t worried about copays or having enough PTO for recovery. I was (and still am) a lower level manager.Recently one of my direct reports injured himself at work, and as I was writing his accident report, I made sure he understood this was for his benefit, because if there was permanent nerve damage, or the injury was worse than we originally thought, it is in his best interest to make sure it’s known this was a workplace injury.This made me think about my own injury. I’m getting older and things are not healing as quickly or easily anymore, I have more aches and pains than I used to. What if my knee ends up starting to cause problems due to arthritis because of the injury I got at work? I’ve had to take off a couple days here and there this year due to sciatica, and also other back pain issues (unrelated to the leg injury, my point is that I’m just having to start taking time off cause of my body is not 20 yo anymore!!)Is it too late to report the broken leg, and was it my responsibility to fill out my own accident report because I am an actual manager and have filled these out for my own direct reports so I understand the need for them? Could my manager get in trouble for not writing this up for me?If it’s too late, it’s too late. I’ll move on and won’t worry about what MIGHT happen.I live in the USA, and work for a large company with over 6,000 ‘employees. And also, my job is one where I am physically active, and mobility is very important to my daily tasks.",0

"If Gage Grosskreutz had shot Kyle Rittenhouse instead of trying to disarm him, would he have been within his legal right? I watched a lot of the Rittenhouse trial, and I don't want this to become a post about whether or not people agree with that verdict, but I still don't understand who was legally, ""correct,"" between Kyle and Gage.  If you don't know, Gage was the 3rd person that Kyle shot, and never made physical contact with Kyle.  Kyle shot Gage and was found not guilty of attempted homicide, with the defense claiming that the fact that Gage had a deadly weapon entitled Kyle to defend himself.  However, it would seem at this point that had Gage shot Kyle, he would have been very well within his right to defend not only himself, but others around him (given that his statement under oath is that he was responding to what he thought was an active shooter, then witnessed that person shoot somebody right in front of him).  So who has the right to defend themselves in this situation?  Is there an overlapping area where one person can use deadly force to defend themselves (and/or other people) against a person that is using deadly force to defend themselves?",1
" Am I overreacting about being touched by a coworker? I started working at this place about 3 months ago. At first this coworker was mean when I asked for help (I'm in training) but after being confronted by management they changed their ways.

I froze in panic and said nothing.

Two weekends ago we had 3 people retiring, so my boss asked me to run over to the grocery store and buy 3 cakes. I came back and threw the cakes in our fridge and gave my boss the receipt. When I got my pay-check last week, I noticed I wasn’t reimbursed for the cakes my work made me buy, so I confronted my boss. Normally my boss was been super nice and I’ve worked for her for 7 years now, however, she said she lost the receipt and can’t pay me back. So the next day I brought in a bank statement showing what I had purchased and she still refused to reimburse me. I talked to her higher up, however about 2 months ago we had gotten new upper management, who could care less about us, and when I contacted them, they said it’s out of their hands since the original receipt was gone.

"Trust / Crummey Letter Question My grandparents set up two trusts for grandchildren (11 of us total). The first one was created in 1990, before my sister was born. The second one was created in 1993 or so, after my sister was born. In my understanding, there are 10 beneficiaries on the first trust and 11 on the second, but I could be wrong.My grandmother died in 2014. My grandfather died in 2020. After my grandmother died, my grandfather was still contributing to the trusts annually. From 2015 - 2020 I received a Crummey letter, and every year I waived my right to receive my share of what was gifted to the trusts.My grandparents’ estate was pretty large, and it is still being settled. One of my cousins asked my mother recently what all the Crummey letter stuff was about and if we would receive money from that. My mother told her that we (the grandchildren) would not be receiving money from the trusts, and that is something my grandparents did to avoid taxes. I don’t think my mother or any of her three siblings have any malicious intent (I know families can get ugly in these circumstances). But I also think my mother misspoke in saying that the grandchildren would not receive money from the trusts.My questions…The grandchildren should receive money from the trusts, correct?When will the grandchildren receive the money from the trusts? Is there typically a date of maturity for the trust? Or is it just likely when the estate is resolved, and the powers that be get to this piece of the larger estate puzzle?As a beneficiary of the trusts, do I have any legal rights to acquire information regarding the state of the trusts?Thanks for the help.

" Boss said something really racist in my 1-1 meeting yesterday. It is really really pissing me off. So  I had a meeting with my boss yesterday. He was berating me for some  slack message I sent out. I sent out a message saying ""I will let my  colleague continue this conversation. I am just helping her. I have some  work to do."" He was berating me because I said I have some work to do.I  don't know why I said that this, but I said that I saw people get into  shouting matches at my previous company and none of them were fired. I  made this up. Nobody at my previous company had any shouting matches or  anything. I don't know why I said this. At this point he gets really  riled up. And says ""We don't do that stuff in America. Maybe they do  that stuff in those Asiatic countries. Maybe they do that stuff in the  Bangalore office. But here in America we don't do that stuff"". I am an  Indian and I have been living in America for 7 years now. Surprisingly  this is the first time someone said anything racist to me. My boss is  an Asian too, but not an Indian.His  behavior is really really pissing me off. I can ignore the rest of the  shit that he said, but this thing that he said really really hurt me.

There is absolutely no chance that my boss doesn't know where I have previously worked.  Even when I corrected him and told him that my previous job was in New York, his response was that New York is different and doesn't really reflect American work culture.Edit 2: I was helping my colleague by posting on behalf of her in a public Slack channel. I have tagged her atleast 2 times in comments. People were asking me questions in that channel about her project that I was not able to answer, so I said ""I will let her lead the conversation.

"Question about secured loans and double pledging collateral. If you had say, a really nice painting, a really large building or residential property, or piece of land, or portfolio with long term assets -Could you potentially used two credit accounts to pay each of them off month to month without collateral being seized? The idea would be that you would double pledge the collateral for two different loans for accounts that you paid off on a staggered basis with the other account. If you had millions of dollars worth of assets, and you just pledged them on an ongoing basis to two different accounts, taking advantage of the low interest rate and lack of down payment needed for a collateralized line of credit, could this go on indefinitely for something like consumption expenditures for some amount of years without any credit score depreciation or interest rate penalty as a result?My thought would also be that you could use it to purchase other assets and put your collateralized assets up on the market with a pretty high ask price and eventually sell it and then pledge the newly acquired assets and repeat the process.Or would you quickly accrue lots and lots of interest payments and have a shit credit score as a result?I’ve heard that some people with net worth in the billions do this in order to avoid selling their assets and incurring capital gains taxes, and I’m wondering how they’re able to maintain their credit scores and avoid getting collateral seized frequently. Because you can be delinquent and have your collateral seized, which was my initial thought, ie essentially selling your collateral to the bank, but I imagine you would get a penalty for that.How do they do it exactly?",2

My sister is selling her car, but 1) she hasn't been able to actually give me (rather my mom because apparently she cant just communicate with me abt this) a set price, it was 3k, then 2k, and now 3.6k, and 2) she, in the first place, is only selling it because she wants to buy a pretty new car for a road trip coast to coast.The car itself is I want to say 2-3 years old, she's still paying it off, but one of the big turn-offs for me is that it has no ABS (therefore no cruise control). I travel a lot for band, and possibly in the coming future as a military wife. Having comfort features like cruise control are very important to me because who wants to be driving 5 hours one-way every other weekend in an uncomfortable car?I've found so many cars online that have way more than I could ask for, where I'd only have to pay a high-200 monthly if I put down the price my sister is asking me for. Would it be more worth it to go for one of those (especially since i have no other monthly fees other than rent) rather than the car my sister is trying to sell? I know it sounds kind of bougie, but she's also practically begging to have me buy it off her because she cant find anyone else that would want to buy it.TL;DR: old car from my sister for $3600 that lacks comfort for long trips, or new car for 3600 dp + ~275 monthly that I would love?",2
" Education I applied for a job with my resume. On my resume, under education, I listed Bachelor’s Degree along with my GPA, as I was already supposed to be completed with my degree at the time of applying.Well I found out that some of my electives didn’t cross over and now my commencement date had been pushed back to 12/19/22.I emailed the recruiter who had been my point of contact about the situation along with the paperwork form my school that gives the new commencement date.The job doesn’t require a bachelor’s degree but says “A bachelor’s degree or a combination of education and experience.”My question is, how bad does this look for a candidate? I have my last interview on Friday and wanted to let them know beforehand so it doesn’t look like I’m withholding information.",0
" I was fired over false allegations. How do I recover from this? Last year my employer fired me over false allegations. I was not able to properly defend myself at the time because I did not have all of the information. It took nearly a year for me to learn the whole story. I will give as much information as I can without violating my privacy.I worked for a place with a lot of rules, many of them very odd and overbearing. If I mentioned the name, many people here would recognize it and immediately have a bad impression. A few people would have a good impression. I was actually doing what I had trained to do and was in the position that I had always wanted. The pay was good for my field. I had a contract, but the atmosphere was toxic for many reasons. I was working with HR to build a case about the cause of some of the toxicity.The HR director asked me for some information. I had to contact 2 people no in my department to get that information. The people claimed no knowledge of what I was asking about. The next day their boss (a VP level position) comes into my office and asks me a strange question that made no sense to me.The next morning when I went into work I was locked out of my email and all other accounts. The HR director appeared and took me to my VP. I was accused of breaking a policy and placed on suspension pending an investigation. I had to turn over my keys, ID, etc.The next day I was allowed to give a statement where I denied the allegations. I could not make an effective defense because since I was innocent I did not know what evidence they might claim that they had against me. I wrote a follow-up letter explaining my side and once again denying the allegations. 2 days later my contract was terminated and I was fired.My unemployment was denied. I filed an appeal, which was finally heard a couple of months ago. During this hearing I learned a few things. Someone had entered my office and planted evidence.  I was supposedly warning about violating this policy in the past. 1) I never received any warning. 2) I never did what they accused me of doing. I swore under oath in front of a judge that I did not do what they had accused me of doing. They had 2 witnesses testify that I did. I learned that the VP who made the strange comment to me was the one who initiated the investigation into me. My lawyer was convinced that I was the victim of retaliation. The judge ruled against me.I am innocent of the charges against me. Most of my colleagues believe me. I got a new job, making significantly less than I did. My current employer does not care about this incident because they know me and they know how awful my former employer is. Emotionally and psychologically I am better off being away from that environment. Financially, I am in bad shape.How do I recover professionally from this experience?How do I explain this situation to future perspective employers?Thank you.",0

" Can my current employer find out if I have accepted another position if I don't tell them? Okay, so my current employer recently notified us that we are being laid off in November due to our client not renewing their contract with the company. They are offering a retention bonus to those of us who decide to stay through the contract end date in November, but they have placed eligibility requirements on that retention bonus. One of those requirements is that we cannot accept another job offer until after our employment has been terminated.So here's my question:I obviously have been job hunting and just accepted a new position with another company. They are willing to work with me on my start date so that I am able to work through the contract end date with my current employer. If I just don't tell my current employer that I've accepted another offer, can they still find out and revoke my retention bonus? The only thing that concerns me is that the new company is completing a background check as part of their pre-employment process and I'm worried that they will contact my current employer and they will find out that way. Am I overthinking this? I obviously don't want to keep working for my current employer if they aren't going to pay me the retention bonus, so I don't know what to tell the new employer with regard to my start date.Thanks in advance for your input!!",0

"Would my friend be prosecuted if she sought legal action? Shortly put, my good friend was sexually assaulted a few weeks ago. She was staying the night with a mutual good friend who unfortunately took advantage of her while she was asleep. She asked about my thoughts on legal action, and I gave her my advice to take legal action.Now, I think we have enough evidence to make a case. We have texts between them where he confessed to doing it, both with her and with her boyfriend. I was also with them that night (I left before they went to bed), and I have video evidence that they were together that night.The only problem is this: they were both drinking, and they were both 19 (I'm also 19, but I didn't drink because I had to drive home for the night). He was the one who possessed the alcohol and gave it to her. I'm not going to speak on their levels of intoxication other than to say that it appeared that she was drunker than he was. Her concern is that in order to pursue legal action, she would have to admit to underage drinking, which in our state is a third-class misdemeanor, punishable by up to a month in jail or a $500 fine.I'm wondering if she would be persecuted for her drinking, if she would be able to get a plea deal of some sort, or if her charges would be waived under the circumstances.Please help me out here. In the messages he sent her the next day, he confessed to doing the same to several other girls in the past, and I want him to be brought to justice for his actions. I don't want him to get away because my friend is afraid to be punished.",1

" As a conversationalist should I purposefully not include a Cover Letter? Ok I let me explain. I'm  a recent graduate and most of my internships I have gotten were from jobs where I never submitted a cover letter. I have been taught that having a good cover letter is very important (something I am currently working on).I'm a conversationalist, and I think I do well in most interviews (I think LMAO). My issue is that I am not the best writer. Though I can do well writing, I much prefer getting into a room with someone, sitting down and talking, rather than trying to expand on my experience and skills through a single paged document paired with my resume.So is it ever a strategy or does it ever make sense to purposefully forgo a cover letter when it is not required? or does not including a cover letter only lower my chances of getting an interview and a job?Many thanks for any responses!!!",0
"Advice on how to tell a brand new employer I am 5 months pregnant?  In California, but the company offers 12 weeks of paid leave across all locations. This is the best job I've ever had and the first with full benefits. I was told my interview stood out over the last year. I feel like I am about to be a big disappointment or that I am letting them down.It's a tech company with 500+ employees.

My first 1:1 is tomorrow - day 3 of work.Questions:Is tomorrow too soon to tell them? I worry about waiting since I don't know when their internal assignments begin.Should I apologize? Offer to take the leave unpaid (especially because I'd like to be off longer than 12 weeks)?What's the best way to phrase things as I let them know?

If she does not take one, at the end of those 2 months she will get a severance package of 2 more months all at once.She is not interested in staying, because the available rolls would be a major step down in pay and schedule, so she is determined to go external.

"Account that functions like a real estate trust account What type of account would suit this type of a business transaction: The transaction is similar to earnest money on a house in the way that there are three parties. The person who is paying, the person who is receiving the payment (according to the terms of the contract) and a third party who is facilitating the deal and who would establish the account. For this scenario it would need to be an account that money could only be removed from according to the terms of the contract, but ideally multiple transactions from multiple parties could go into the account. Does a trust account work like that? Can earnest money from multiple buyers on multiple houses go into a trust account or is there a separate account for each transaction? In essence, do you know an account where funds can be securely held by a third party until the contract is complete and that allows for multiple contracts and parties that is not for real estate?",2

" 6mo Unpaid Travel.. can HR help me? So I started at my job June 2021, and in October they asked me to start covering for a part-timer who was in the hospital at a location 25 minutes from me (my typical drive is like 8). I was told by our district manager at the time I’d be compensated, and over the next two months I received ~$200/mo for working every Saturday and some wednesdays. So now it’s January, and said district manager leaves, followed by the manager of the 2nd location, the territory manager, and the part-timer. In all this chaos there was never some one available to send my mileage to. We changed hands every few months and honestly I was juggling work and school and couldn’t keep track of who or where or when.

So, now we’ve been under direction of our current territory manager for some time, and it’s official it will be that way for some time, so I went through all of my texts and pictures and any date I had evidence for I compiled. I wrote out the list and gave it to my manager who said she’d pass it on, and eventually I get a call from the territory manager.

TLDR In short she said that due to the changing of hands, I’ll only be reimbursed from July of this year onwards. Those 4 months amounted to $90 which didn’t seem right considering what I was paid last year. And those 4/10 months are nothing-the majority of my coverage and drive time there was in the first 6mo this year when she wasn’t here and there was no one to really report to. Something about this just doesn’t seem right- and I don’t know if HR would be the right call for something like this, or if I should just be happy with what I got. The associate handbook for travel time is as follows;

“”TRAVEL TIME AND MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT ____ pays both travel time and mileage expense to Associates who have been requested by appropriate supervisory personnel to provide temporary coverage at a store other than where they are normally scheduled to work. The rules and method to record and submit authorized travel time and mileage expense for payment are as follows: Travel time will be recorded and paid through Payroll ON THE TIME SHEET OF THE LOCATION TO WHICH YOU ARE TEMPORARILY ASSIGNED and must be entered as a Time Clock Edit. If commuting from home to the temporarily assigned store, travel time in excess of commute time from home to base store will be paid. If asked to change locations during a regular shift, travel time between locations will be paid. Mileage expense for approved travel will be paid at the company's standard reimbursement rate per mile that is in effect at the time of travel (check with District Manager to confirm rate, if necessary).",0

"Is a self-exculpatory clause in an adhesive contract enforceable? I have a complaint against a stock broker.I had a bull put spread on IWM and a stop loss order to liquidate it if the stock hit my short strike. I got hit, the stop loss was triggered, the short position was covered, but the long position was not sold. I was also not notified that I remained long. This is clearly shown in the record and isn't in dispute.Next morning I sold the long options, losing $8400 more  compared to the price shown at the time the other leg was closed.I demanded that the broker reimburse me, for their obvious failure, but their dispute resolution team gave me some excuse that there was a problem with my account that prevented them from selling the long position, but couldn't tell me exactly what the problem was. I'm still pressuring them for an explanation.In the mean time, I was reading through their adhesive Account Agreement, and came across this gem:""We will not be liable for lost profits, trading losses or other damages resulting from the delay or loss of use of the services. In any case, our liability arising from any legal claim (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) relating to the services will not exceed the amount you have paid for use of the services.""Is such a self-exculpatory clause in an adhesive contract enforceable?

"Which order is better to May off loans in? A small one with no interest or a large one for interest? For context, I’m referring to a mortgage at $150000 with 3% APR (30 year) and a $6000 loan (5 year) with no interest for furnishing. Typically, I overpaid the mortgage with $100-$200 dollars each month. A minimum of $100 of that is going towards the furnishing loan. That leave about $100 per a month I could use for either of the loans. Which would be a better choice?  Also, is there a formula I could use to help calculate this?Thank you.",2
" Importance of Job Titles As I've asked this subreddit before, I'm gunning for a significant raise with my current employer. Part of that will likely entail a change in job title. I normally think job titles are silly, but I'm also realizing that it helps to titles reflective of the role when it comes to job searching (not that I'm in the market but you never know).I'm currently the only person in a role/department that was essentially created just for me. My role and duties are essentially very senior-/executive-level duties, despite a job title that is VERY junior sounding. Any change in title is going to a promotion in name only as it won't change my duties at all.Besides looking good in the event I'm job searching again, what are other ways/reasons that my employer could benefit from giving me a more senior title?",0

How to execute a will in Florida My dad died this week. He had a will prepared a couple years ago which was done at a free law library not by a law firm. So basically a LegalZoom will.

" Seeking advice - co-worker continues to come to work contagious I’m seeking guidance on behalf of a family member who is not on reddit. They work at a small company (approx. 50 employees) and one person consistently comes to work with contagious illnesses (colds, flu, stomach, flu, even COVID). The company does have a policy that encourages employee to stay home when they’re sick, but it doesn’t seem to be enforced – or at least not for this person, who seems to buck at authority and just comes to work anyway. My family member has not been with the company long enough to earn sick leave or paid time off. So whenever they get sick and have to stay home, that’s unpaid time. Additionally, their spouse has an autoimmune disorder, which places them at risk for more significant symptoms, particularly when it pertains to upper respiratory viruses. Since starting at this company, my family member has ben sick 6x as a result of this person coming into work sick. They missed an entire week of work (and wages) in early September, due to this co-worker coming to work with COVID and passing it around the office. At that time, the co-worker was given a “talking to” about not being at work when sick. But over the past two weeks, that person has repeatedly come into work with a stomach flu-like virus (GI distress, diarrhea, vomiting) and my relative finally caught it. And, again, had to take unpaid time off to recover.Staying away from this person is not an option. They share an office area and the co-worker is one of those toxic people that “allows” their stuff to “bleed over” to my relative’s work area, is always breathing down their neck, looking over their shoulder to see what they’re doing, etc. My relative is trying to find a different job, but wants to minimize the damage (financial and health wise) while in this process. They also have a concern about not giving an opening for the manager to say she’s been blindsided by my relative’s decision to seek work elsewhere. How should they approach their manager, knowing that this will be a repeat complaint?Is there a better way to make a complaint and request that this co-worker be made to stay home when they have a communicable disease? Does it go too far to ask that this co-worker be moved elsewhere, so that if they come to work sick, my relative is not being so constantly and directly exposed to it? My relative cannot be moved, because they work in a front desk/reception capacity and have to be where they’re currently stationed. What about asking for the ability to work from home when the co-worker is sick, so that if they choose to come to work while infections, at least my relative can protect themselves? These are all ideas that I have been discussing with them, but we’re not sure how to best introduce them, or how to best approach the manager, regarding these concerns?",0

"Falsification of Property disclosure I bought a house in May 22 and there was no indication of basement flooding on the property disclosure. During the inspection, there were indications of basement flooding so I asked explicitly about it and was told it was not a problem. In July, my new neighbors informed me that my basement does flood but the seller had something installed but they didn't think it addressed the problem completely. Last weekend we had heavy rain while I was at work at the fire department for 24 hours. I checked the basement camera and all appeared to be fine. After being home a couple days, I went into the basement and found about 4 inches of standing water. It took hours using a shopvac to empty the water 5 gallons at a time.

Thankfully most of my stuff was above the water level but there will still be a loss of property and personal, irreplaceable, and collectors items.

" How would you react to audio recordings submitted for harassment allegations. Hi HR pros!My SIL is currently experiencing harassment in the workplace. She was warned when hired that her boss was ‘eccentric’ and ‘difficult’. His harassment has escalated and I’m concerned.She employed in VA, which is a single party consent state for recording conversations. It appears as long as she is in a public space and records, she is in compliance with the law.Her boss has 15 years tenure as a scientist (i.e. difficult to replace) at this company, while she has only been employed for 3 months (also a scientist, but far less experienced). I believe HRs warning about her boss indicates they understand he is potentially abusive and are not inclined to step in.Rather than initiating a ‘he said/she said’ accusation, I am wondering if recording a few conversations for evidence would be in her best interest? Will HR consider this as evidence? Is it worth it? She loves her work and wants to stay.Any advice you can give us greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!

Issues resulting in complaints are more systemic: 1. Info needed to do our jobs can be hard to attain.  Staff do not understand ""teamwork"" and ""communication"" so, 2. some staff will  not address an issue directly, seeking to understand co-workers' rationale. Instead they complain about the co-worker.Rules for the job have changed suddenly and dramatically.  We have been disciplined for not being able to track rapid, sweeping changes in practice. Therefore, I have unfactual info in  my  file. I was interviewed by management, and I also replied in writing, in an effort  to clarify. This has had no affect on my file. Some of the complaints  mischaracterize the events reported and mischaracterize me. I have addressed this in writing.

"Can i get someone (or anyone) to pay for damages they incurred if they don't have insurance? I bought a building earlier this year with the intention of moving my business into it once certain repairs were completed. These repairs included having the outer brick walls redone as it had fallen into disrepair over the past decade of being vacant. Because the brick issues were a safety concern, the only insurance any company would sell me right away was liability insurance to cover any workers that were working on getting the building up to code. I would have had it fully insured if anyone would have offered it.A little over two weeks ago, someone ran a stop sign (my bulding is on the corner opposite), was hit by another car, and wound up crashing through the front of my building. Once i got a copy of the police report i learned that the driver who was responsible for the accident didn't even have a driver's license, let alone insurance for the car. So my insurance told me that this isn't their problem due to only having liability insurance and his doesn't exist.My insurance company told me to take him to small claims court but between the work that was already scheduled to be done and the new repairs that are now needed I really can't afford a lawer right now. I'm also very skeptical that this guy has much money. (I'm basing that off police/court records i was able to look up on him) so I'm not sure if there's any point.Also, i have had some of the new damage looked at by people who can fix it but at the moment i am not fully sure of how much his car accident caused.

" Work forcing me to use the term ""master bedroom"" Hello! I work in marketing for a property management company in California.

I’m a trainee and my training should be finished by now and on company time but I’m 7 months in and haven’t even set my first test and she doesn’t give me time during work and suggests I do it at home in my free time.This Halloween some members of staff went on a night out and one of them dressed up in black face and posted the picture in the WhatsApp group chat with the caption of a black disabled patients name we dispense for pretending to be their cousin (e.g. janes doe’s cousin), and my managed replied great costume guys… It  really just shows what kind of people I work with. I’ve also witnessed my manager be passive aggressive with methadone users because she knows she can get away with it and make other comments about patients walking out such as “she reminds me of a prostitute”.Another pharmacist brought the way I was being treated to the attention of the district manager who replied “there’s nothing I can do until the employee comes forward” and handed my manager a bunch of flowers a few days later for her 10 year service with the company. The managers are so cliquey so if I speak up everyone will know, my manager tells everyone’s business to anyone she can gossip to and the same goes for all the store managers in the surrounding areas.My mental health has completely crumbled and I no longer feel confident after after getting put down for so long. I feel suicidal a lot, it’s affected my relationship with my fiancé as I can’t wind down and feel so stressed out. I cry a lot in the bathroom at work.This is a well known pharmacy chain who spends a lot of diversity campaigns but the inside of the company is absolutely toxic I need to get out of this job but no two employees are allowed to be off work at the same time and the full of November is fully booked out and no one is allowed holidays during December, sick days aren’t an option as I need the money and they get held against me.It seems like I won’t get time off for interviews to get out of there.  What are my options?",0
 Use of psychometric assessments for employees reapplying on their current jobs Our organization is going through a reorg Some jobs will be cut and some job descriptions are being rewritten. Current employees will be reapplying on their current jobs. Korn Ferry psychometric assessments are being considered as part of that reapplication process. Is this normal? I assumed that those assessments could be used for new hires but am not sure why they are being discussed in the case where a current employee is reapplying on their own job. Is this normal practice? I feel that this could lead to grievances and discrimination complaints.,0

" Can I get reprimanded for not meeting the standards of a job I didn’t want nor qualified for? During my interview with my current job, they told me what some of my duties would be which included user testing and technical writing. They already had my resume and I gave them examples of my web design work and more. The minimum qualifications didn’t require any programming, coding, etc. During the first week, I wasn’t really told about my duties but soon realized they placed me in a web development position; front-end to be specific. I spoke to my supervisor and she was confused with my placement too since she wasn’t included in the interview process to ask any technical questions. Basically, they confused web design with web development even though they planned on placing me in a technical writing position but when they heard web design, they decided I’d be best in the production area even though my skills were listed on my resume.When they realized what happened, they offered me a vacancy in a different division doing something I wasn’t interested in nor could physically do so then they told me they’d book classes for me to learn programming. A few weeks later, they said the classes weren’t in the budget so I tried learning from Google, YouTube, and other free resources. I just received my 6mo performance review and failed. Everything I was given that I could do wasn’t up to par due to lack of instructions and details even though I asked multiple times in person, email, and Teams. I did what I could with what I had. My supervisor said to get used to it because that’s how they unfortunately operate there. I added comments in my PR to make sure it was documented that this wasn’t the position I applied for and was not qualified for the position I was placed in.I’ve been applying for new jobs but I also don’t want to get fired or written up for insubordination for not grasping JavaScript because of someone else’s mistake.

"Shorter or Longer Term Loans? Lets say I am a lender and I have 2 options of loans to give out,1 Month Loan @ 1% interest rate over the 1 monthand12 Month Loan at 12% interest rate over the 12 monthHow do I determine which loan to give? Assuming the borrower will accept any loan I give out.For example if a borrower wants to borrow $1000. I can offer them the 1 month loan and make, $10 in one month. Or I can offer them the 12 Month Loan, and receive $120. If we only evaluate it this way, then the 12 Month Loan is the answer.However, if I give the one month loan to the borrower, I get $1010 back in one month. And if I lend this $1010 out to borrower 2, after getting my money back in 1 month. I can charge 10% on $1010, and receive $1020.1 back at end of month 2.If I do this over and over again until the end of the 12 months. I would receive $126.83 in interest. Which is $6 more.So how do I compare these two options?The 1 Month loan has the risk, that if I can't find another borrower for month 2. Is there a way I can take into consideration this risk?",2

" Was I strung along by a prospective employer for eight months? Is this normal HR hiring work? In February, I applied for a top manager position at a think tank which is very well-respected and well-known in my industry. I did not meet the experience qualifications, but I work in an adjacent space to the think-tank and felt I do much of the responsibilities listed for the position already.Over the next month, I had two interviews; in the latter I was told by the HR person I was just too inexperienced compared to other candidates. I understood and moved on.In May, I was reached out by the same HR person for a position directly under the exec position. HR person said I would be a top candidate. I ""applied"" (I just emailed the same resume, as instructed by HR person) and had two more interviews for the position. Then I received radio silence the entire summer. I thought I was rejected.In August, the HR person reaches back out to say the position has been rebranded and modified, and if interested, I am still the top candidate. In fact, HR person and I start discussing salary ranges in our first interview for this position (that's 5 interviews now). HR person even connected me with a subordinate in the company (if given this position, I would be her boss) to assist her project, to which I was very familiar about through my current work.I had an interview last month (6th one total), which I thought went pretty well. After a month of no contact, I received an email on Sunday night saying they are moving forward with different candidates. HR person thanked me for my patience and encouraged me to apply again.My partner who has been privy to all this exploded last night at what she claimed is huge unprofessionalism by the HR person and this think tank. She claims what has happened in on par with getting strung along and said to never apply to this place ever again. Perhaps I'm just worn out by the long-drawn process, but I couldn't bring myself to be so angry.  I'm asking for some clarity on whether this kind of behavior is normal (or abnormal) and if there are any learning lessons from this.",0

"(US) I know of a military guy who keeps marrying poor women to get family loans and other types of family assistance from the military and then abuses and ditches the women.

"I don’t know what to say to a doctor about something that happened during surgery or if this is against a legal policy So today I went in to get my wisdom teeth removed as one does. I have had many surgeries much longer than this one and much more intense. The last surgery apart from this one I had I got an infection afterwards and my life was put on hold for about 6 months. Afterwards I have been really apprehensive about any form of doctors. I had to go to the dentist and I thought I found a really amazing practice. They had great reviews, understood my past surgeries, and seemed very sweet.Well today was the day of my wisdom teeth surgery. I discussed the procedure with the dentist again and the nurse making sure to emphasize that I would be put under and that I’ve done it a few times before. Well I didn’t even know this could happen but I woke up around 10-15 minutes before the surgery was over ( this was supposed to be a 30-45 minute surgery) and I was trying to tell the dentist and the nurse there. He told me to be quiet and stop crying. I could feel the surgery happening in my mouth and started crying and freaking out immediately. He just did not seem to care at all. He then left the room and my mom came it to get ready to take me home (you can’t drive yourself after). They had to hold me extra because my heart rate and blood pressure were so high trying to ask the nurse why he did that and telling my mom what had happened. I have to say I was freaking out and everyone in the room and near it could hear me. The doctor came back in the room and said something along the lines of “I’m sure I’m going to hear from you tomorrow/ get a call tomorrow”.I want to call tomorrow but I have no idea what to say. I am really scared of this man now and just writing this I am crying. I also felt like he didn’t even care about what happened when I was in a lot of pain.What do I say? How should I handle this?I was pointed to this discussion after a sub to ask doctors advice about this situation.",1

" Employee harasses and undermines me at work. How do I protect myself? I started a new job as a manager about 8 months ago. Generally speaking I love my job. My hours are very reasonable compared to my last career, I like my coworkers and I find the work we do to be very fulfilling. There is one major issue though. Part of my responsibility is managing a small part time staff. I am having major issues with one member of this staff (let’s call her Jennifer). I will start off by saying I have not taken on disciplinary responsibilities yet because our boss wanted to mitigate my professional responsibilities til I have a chance to learn how to do my job. I was made aware of this before I was hired as it was in the job description and I am totally fine with it.The first few weeks of my job before I was officially hired I worked at a special event my company sponsored. Jennifer was a staff member at this event too. I completed a minor task incorrectly and Jennifer berated me to the point that it made me extremely uncomfortable. After that incident she made it a point to follow me around and  give me really nitpicky feedback so I made it a point for the remainder of the week to be polite but distant.For the most part I have continued my strategy of polite distance. When I know Jennifer is coming in I put in my headphones, put my head down and work. (Which is not hard because I have a lot of responsibility and I am still learning how to do my job) Unfortunately Jennifer’s behavior has escalated to the point it is very difficult to ignore.Jennifer emails me frequently about things that are outside of her job responsibility that most of the time I am already dealing with. A lot of the time she cc’s my boss and sometimes she’ll go speak to my boss directly if I don’t respond quickly enough or do things to her liking. Jennifer also goes above my head and makes changes to the program I run without consulting me. About a month ago she consulted with our technology coordinator and scheduled a meeting with him without discussing it with me at all. Several things like this have happened since I started in my position. Recently she has started getting into our shared drive at work and editing public files I have not edited to her liking.The worst incident that has occurred involved her screaming at me in front of the rest of our office staff. The issue was she wanted me to order a machine part and I didn’t do it. (I communicated with her beforehand i would not be ordering the part and why) I don’t feel comfortable giving her feedback because of her erratic behavior. I felt like this specific incident was intended to “put me in my place” and Jennifer is used to bullying others to get her way.I have had multiple meetings with my boss and Jennifer. I have been told Jennifer has a history of treating people in my position badly. Another employee told me this was extremely frustrating for the last person in my position. My boss is fairly new to our company and I think she’s pretty great. She has limited Jennifer’s hours in the office and always takes my concerns seriously. All of our PT staff are buddies and I think there is some concern they’ll all quit if Jennifer is fired and our company will be left in the lurch. Jennifer and her friends have been with our company for the last five years so I have some doubts she’ll be dismissed any time soon.What should I be doing to protect myself and my job? Do you have any advice on dealing with this kind of person from an HR standpoint? I limit my interactions with jennifer as much as possible (which is difficult because I don’t have a private office), I communicate with my boss immediately when there are issues and I try not to meet with her if nobody else is present. My anxiety is sky high whenever I interact with Jennifer in any capacity. It is starting to have a really negative effect on mental health and I find myself really fixated on this issue.",0

"I now am well aware that a past smartphone of mine was extracted and doxxed, I suspect by the Police. For reference I'm in the UK.

Suffice to say I felt pretty violated by that and it evoked strong reactions and hate towards me. I stress that it was obviously nothing illegal but it was NSFW.I believe a past smartphone was extracted following a police report I submitted for harrassment in 2018 and the phone may have been tapped. I believe I was suspected of criminal activity but this was false. Subsequently this private data which had been extracted and retained by police was leaked.

Conversely, if the Fed is cutting interest rates, money flows into existing T-bills driving up prices as investors buy up the higher-yielding T-bills.""If I understand correctly, any bank can be the recipient of fed funds rates. So when fed fund rates are high, the banks have very little money and vice versa. It says that T bills go down when fed fund rates are high. If a bank needs money while fed fund rates are high, it is gonna raise the interest rates of the bonds it offers to raise funding. Is this why T bills go down? It becomes more attractive to buy bank bonds rather than treasury bonds?And when fed funds are low, bank bond rates are low so treasury bond rates are relatively high?Also: does the money market include both treasury bond opportunities and bank/corporate bond opportunities?",2
"Are Balisongs Illegal in Washington state I've recently picked up Balisong flipping as a hobby, currently I use a trainer but I would love to own a live blade at some point. I am not really even looking to edc I just have found Washington knife laws to be very vague, it says nearly anything is lawful to carry openly as long as there is no ill intent. Here's where it gets confusing, it seems anything considered a switchblade is illegal explicitly. Yet Stilettos are legal (which are a spring release knife,) I've seen some states describe balisongs as a switchblade because gravity knives fall under that category, when they have no release mechanism and even using gravity is something you can do to open a pocket knife. I've taken the mindset at this point its kind of don't ask don't tell and it may be confiscated, but if I own one am I breaking the law and will I get into legal trouble if I pocket clip carry?

"USPTO Trademark Protection Question / USA Hi!  I am in California, USA. I submitted a trademark in my company name to the USPTO about a month ago.

" What do recruiters think of candidates who “jump” often? In January I started a CDD risk position at a start up, but despite being praised for performing well, I was laid off three months later (early April) as the company was going through losses. I was hired at another company, a bank, in June for the same position. I was hired through an agency, which then got me a placement at my company. This means that I (1) get paid less than market standard since the agency takes a cut, and (2) there’s no real job security since I’m not hired by the bank and I can just be terminated for any reason. The bank offers permanent contracts only after 1.5 years. In the job interview, they gave the impression that it will take less time. Im just about to enter my 5th month with the new company. Because of these reasons, I’m thinking of starting to look around for other job openings.All that said, what do recruiters think of candidates who have spent only a short amount of time in two previous companies?

"Question about fees & online accounts + prisoners Hello AskLegal - I have a family member in a county prison.  She has already pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing.  She's been there for 2 years now.  They keep pushing out her sentencing because they want her as a witness in her co-defendant case and sentencing will put her in either TX or MN. (This is frustrating in and of itself. County prison doesn't give her access to GED materials or rehab for her physical issues. )Sadly, I'm not a stranger to the prison system- My father was incarcerated for years when I was younger.  I know that I can reduce the risk of her recidivism by having a relationship with her and encouraging others close to keep their relationships active with her  as well. As you probably know, this will be difficult with her going to another state.The county jail she is in uses a third party for communications (InmateCanteen). I've been ranting about them for a while to my friends - They charge $8.95 service fee- whether you add $10 or $100.  I think it is predatory on low income families, which I know represent a disproportionate # of prisoners. My waitress sister likely uses her tip money to communicate w/ her daughter and has small amts to deposit.Now I see that they charge a monthly fee to keep the money in the account.  Their terms of service do not spell out their fees, and it actually says that they have the right to change them without notice.  So they are going to get the money they want out of me one way or another.So I have two questions.  First, can they do that?  Keep money without explaining fees or giving you notice of changing fees? Just because it is in their ToS does that make it okay?Second, where do I start writing/calling if I want to reach out to gov't about this system?  Is it my congressman?  The congressman of MO (ugh - Left there for PNW for a reason!)tl;dr I find the fees charged to speak to inmates unreasonable and not explained in their ToS. I would like to affect change.",1

" Request to correct disclosure I called Benefits before retiring. They gave me the answer but failed to inform it would change the next month upon CBA expiration. Upon retirement we have no union association, so I never dreamed the contract expiration would affect the terms of my retirement.

It was a simple question, did they still provide retiree health insurance? Answer: “Yes they did, the same plan I retired under, no cost but now with a lifetime accumulation.” They omitted it would soon change with a costly premium schedule. Then change back, with the new contract.

Doesn’t ERISA require questions to be answered truthfully? They were aware of the circumstances - contemplating retirement. What if retirees insurance was being discontinued? The following month?

HR has corrected other retirees missteps, I found a letter of agreement where they extended the enrollment due to confusion. The DOL feels they should rectify and the process is exhausting. The conference calls are upsetting, HR is furious. DOL suggests I contact HR director or Vice-President??

" coworker was caught taking a video of me (from behind, from a distance, without my knowledge). the video practically shows nothing except my butt. is this a fireable offense? I work in manufacturing and I (21F) am the only woman we have working in the shop. As far as I know, I am the first woman to do so ever. A few days ago, a supervisor noticed my coworker (60M) was recording me. Once I turned around and saw what he was doing, he stopped the video. His explanation was that he was taking a video so that I could show my mom what I do at work. You can barely see what I am working on, the video was filmed from about 25 feet away, zoomed in. He does not know my mom and I did not indicate that I wanted to show her my work. My dad (who is another supervisor here) happened to walk by, and the man filming me said he would text the video to my dad so he could “show my mom”. I was weirded out but was busy and my dad didn’t open the text, so I didn’t watch video until after work. Coworker claimed to have deleted the video after this. Once I saw the video, I reported it and forwarded it to my boss. The last two days, coworker has been on paid leave pending investigation. They have questioned everyone, me, my dad, and supervisor who witnessed. They keep expressing that if it were their daughter he were recording they would freak out, fight him, etc. but that he will likely not lose his job over this. They said to my dad that “if he had touched me, he’d be gone”. Does it really have to get to the point of sexual assault for him to be fired? Is sexual harassment (with video proof) not enough?

I Haven’t worked with this person directly for 5 months (she was my manager prior to that 5 months). When I asked during our 1:1 about specific examples based on the letter, she gave vague responses like it happened several months ago or isn’t aware of the specific details but will dig to get the details. Seems either she’s been trying to document any negative thing she can about me during the last several months despite not managing me or a lot of it is fabricated.Yesterday I found out she scheduled skip level interviews with all my direct reports (similar to what they did when my boss was fired). Fully expect to get fired like my boss later in November. She is very close to our CMO and felt she was sent not only to replace my boss but myself also and they made this decision weeks ago. They are just going through this process to fire us and minimize severance payouts.

" Boss Trying to Take Away 40hr Work Week Limitation - Can We Do Anything? Hello,My partner works for a large corporation that regularly assigns crazy amounts of mandatory overtime to its employees, especially given how short staffed they've become (in no small part because of this crazy overtime).A few months ago my partner started seeing a therapist (masters not a doctorate) who provided him with a written note suggesting he be limited to 40hrs for mental/emotional reasons such as PTSD. His employer honored this for several months, and only required the note be renewed every few months or so.As his partner I can promise you that this limitation has drastically improved his mental/emotional/physical state. He's no loner in constant pain, he's no longer got explosive anger issues, he's got the energy to live his life again. Its difficult to put into words, but he's much better, and this is the only solace he finds in his current job.Today he was handed a form requiring a physician's list of limitations, and is required to complete it by December 1st (which is too short of time to get in an appointment with his therapist currently). He's panicking because his limitation comes from his therapist, not a physician.My question is what is the logical next step for a company where their HR has been entirely unhelpful? Can they legally require new standards in this short of a time frame? Can the therapist list his limitations in place of a physician? I intend to look over the form tonight, but I feel like something here is fishy and I'd like to do anything I can to make sure my partner doesn't have to go back to the constant and unyielding stress that was tearing out relationship apart at the seams.",0

"Why is share buybacks painted as a bad thing in the media? So when I read a newspaper and it talks about share buybacks, it takes the view that it's greedy and a waste of money, something about pushing stock prices higher and thus triggering bonuses linked to share prices.But is it all negative? I thought, and I don't have a business / economics degree or anything, that shares are a way for for publicly listed companies to essentially borrow money without going to the bank to ask for a loan. The interest for what would be a loan is paid out as dividends instead to the shareholder. If that is the case, why wouldn't a company want to buy back it's shares? As bank loans expire when repaid, but shares last forever, then companies borrowing money by issuing shares seems like it's going to cost them more over the long term, forever. So why wouldn't companies when they have spare money buy back their shares and terminate in effect their loans?",2

" Telecommuting vs. remote, travel to and between office locations, and how these factors impact mileage reimbursement A small company has all employees sign a Telecommuting Agreement, indicating that the majority of their job functions can be completed at home but they may need to travel to an office for some duties.

This might occur once a week per employee.Is there official guidance on when or whether any of this travel constitutes anything besides a typical commute? What if one of the employees typically works in office #1 instead of at home for focus, then needs to go from there to office #2 for a matter - would that require reimbursement? Another employee simply likes to work from office #2, no particular reason why, just to be available near clients if needed.

New York has just instilled a new salary transparency law (thank God) in which companies have to list the salary in the job description.I’ve just checked and it says the salary for the role i’m currently interviewing for “starts at $55,000 (with increased salary steps as you learn and master the role).” On one hand, I’m happy that my request was very close to the budget for the role, but after learning more about the role and it’s requirements i’m worried that I lowballed myself and that I’m leaving money on the table.If their range starts at $55,000, I’d assume the other end of the range could be as high as $65k-$70k. How likely is it they’ll exceed my initial salary expectations?",0
" My boss is ghosting me after an interaction with a new employee. I work as a training coordinator for various customer service positions at a small, web based B2B operation.  Last week, we brought in a new employee that has been extremely difficult to train. We’re all remote employees, but she thought the online training sessions were hard to follow and the training guide wasn’t helpful for her.I offered to spend a couple days in our actual office with her, but my boss thought she would be fine training with me at my house. I thought that was a strange suggestion and should have said no, but I didn’t want to press to go into the office (and the new hire said she would rather go to my house) so I agreed.She spent about half a work day here and left early due to a headache. We got very little accomplished. She said she read the guide and she seemed to be listening, but she just wasn’t retaining anything.The next day, I emailed my boss with my thoughts and suggested some other strategies we could try (short training videos, demo web pages etc.) My boss replied very curtly, stating that the new hire didn’t find the environment at my home conducive to learning, so she would be training her personally, in-office.I replied, asking what she meant. I can’t think of anything that would warrant a statement like that, but I’m happy to address and correct any potential problems with my job performance, if that was part of the issue.My boss did not, and has not responded. Not to that email or any of the others I’ve sent regarding other things in the last 3 days.  She hasn’t even responded to a PTO request I put in for the end of the month.I can’t think of anything I did that would warrant this kind of reaction from her. We’ve had a great working relationship for years. I have no idea what this new hire said to her and I’m hurt that she didn’t check with me for my side of whatever story was told.We don’t have an in-house HR, really - the HR dept we report to is at our corporate office and we don’t know them well so I’m hesitant to reach out. But I have no idea how to resolve this with my boss or with the new hire. Please help.",0

 Potential Hire Asking for My Salary I was promoted to Director in 2020 and have been assured I’m “within range” for my pay scale. I’m hiring a new Manager for my team and during review with the recruiter he showed me the current scale for the Manager Range - I’m just above it by $3k (and this is after a September merit increase that I had to fight for). The prospect is asking for my same salary. He’d be a huge benefit to my group and for organization - I desperately need the help. but I’m not sure I can stomach making the same salary. Has anyone else been in this situation?  How’d you handle it?Quick Edit: am not suggesting that we don’t pay. This is more about me coming to terms with it as it’s new territory for me.,0

 HR never came back for my I-9 identification documents after 3 months and I'm still missing one. What problems can arise? When I was employed my driver's license was one month expired and my passport was stolen when my car got broken into (I reported it as stolen already).  I thought my parents had my SSN card and Birth Certificate but they couldn't find it either (at the time).  HR said it would be fine for now if I give them my expired license + receipt of renewal and an e-receipt of me ordering a new SSN card and provide them my real documents later (never specified when).When I Google'd my situation it seemed like I had 3 months to do so.It's been almost 4 months now and HR hasn't gotten back to me yet about my documents.  I received my birth certificate and SSN card from my parents since it turned out they had it after all but my renewed license was lost in the mail so I recently went to the DMV to request a replacement + REAL ID.Are there any repercussions I might face for not providing this yet?

" Employer messed up insurance enrollment, do I get a refund?

" Sick Pay Question Hello all,I'm a single mother and I tend to save my sick hours in the event I need to care for my son whenever he is sick. I'm currently down to having only 18 hours of sick pay and guess what.. I am sick. I usually still go to work but this time I have not been able to even get up from bed since yesterday, this is how bad I am.  Luckily these were my days off. It's so bad that I don't even know how I'm typing this, please excuse any typos. I've tested negative for covid so I can't use any of my  covid hours. My concern really is that I can't work tomorrow but I also can't afford to spend my sick time because I fear my son will be sick between the time of now till next June 2023, which is when I get another 40 hours of sick pay. I just started to think how unfair this is and am wondering if there are any loopholes. My kid doesn't usually get sick but when he does I'm the only who can care for him. Aside from having ADHD, he is a healthy boy.I'm afraid that if I call off tomorrow and use sick time, IF my kid gets sick in the future and I don't have enough sick hours, they will discipline any future call off to the point they'll terminate me. Why is this a concern of mine? Because I'm the hourly manager that presents associates with their termination notice due to their absences.I know i can ask my HR director but before heading to their office I want to have a better understanding of what I can ask for or at least what to expect.

Context: I'm a now senior in an ALS (Alternative Learning Solutions) that's a charter school in the state of Florida, I decided to go to this school after my poor mental health has been ruining me from my 9th grade year to 11th grade year, and with covid happening in when I was in 9th grade and my poor mental health, I decided to go to this ALS charter school to try and get schooling done so I can actually get a highschool diploma instead of GED.I'm a student who has already completed two semesters worth of work plus some from said school to make up credits BEFORE summer started. Well summer ended yesterday, just today I went back to school and had new teachers which is alright, however I'm pretty sure due to the fact that B.E.S.T (Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking Standards) replaced the standard common core in the state of Florida, the teachers mentioned that the math and english curriculum will be updated in the following year/week/month (honestly forgot the timeframe) and then proceeded to mention that classes would need to be reset. Which I felt like there was no need to reset the classes but obviously kept my mouth shut because it's school, then my teacher started going through the list of students who needed to be reset and then mentioned my name, at which that point I wasn't having it and printed out all my current progress in each of my classes, each quiz and lesson I have done, my graduation plan, the credits I have, my test scores and so on and so forth. I'm already halfway finished with the classes I'm currently taking. I don't want to lose the progress that I have already made in my classes.Is this legal? And if it is legal, is there any way I can make sure that I keep my progress in my current classes?",1
"Remote Working Termination Question 1400 employee professional services company based in Texas employs several people who are 100% remote workers in random states, they do not report to offices. I lived in Texas and reported to the head office for over 3 years, but needed to move to Ohio for personal reasons. I requested remote privileges and honestly did not see it being an issue, my boss agreed. Company denied request due to corporate policy that employees working in the corporate sector may not be 100% remote, though employees in the production sectors are allowed. Now they've forced my boss to seek and hire a replacement for me, who starts this month. Once they start and my bosses are satisfied that this person can take over my position (management in IT department), they will terminate my employment. They've implied that I will be expected to train my replacement and have offered no severance. I did request severance since I feel it is rude to expect me to train my replacement knowing they will terminate me (i.e. loyalty goes both ways).I know that Texas is a right to work state, but recently I heard that the company declined to terminate an inept employee against management recommendations due to the fact that the employee is over 55 and hispanic, and they wanted to avoid a lawsuit. I don't think I'm being discriminated against due to my race (Caucasian) or gender (female) or age (30s) in this case, but it got me thinking that if I were hispanic or older, would they fire me? Nobody can really prove that, I suppose, but I do feel discriminated against and as if I (and everyone else working in corporate) are ""less than"" because I'm being fired due to wanting what others are already doing (working remote). To be clear, my boss told me in writing my termination is not due to performance (and routinely states that I am an A player) and I know that he doesn't want to terminate me; he is not being given an option. This policy didn't exist when I was hired; remote working didn't really become a visible topic at the company until covid.I'm curious what your opinions are about this practice.",1
" started a new job and given the wrong salary contract to sign Hi! I am looking for some guidance in addressing an error HR made when signing onto a new position. In my interview I was told my salary range would be categorized under a specific step as it is a union protected position. I wanted to negotiate my salary, but when I received my offer letter it stated my salary was going to be higher- so I did not feel the need to pursue negotiations.When I was formally put into the onboarding system after my letter was signed and returned to HR I noticed that my salary was listed as a lower step. I immediately reached out to HR and that’s when I was informed that they made an error and sent me the wrong salary.I have still not received a new contract or signed anything that states that I am on a lower salary step, but I am being paid the lower amount.I asked to negotiate at this point, but was told that I could not. I am wondering if there’s any law or argument specific to HR’s error where I can advocate for the contract I signed and what I expected to be paid?",0

I talked to them and his Group leader and sorted it out. I stepped away and just minded my own business to keep things calm. Well later on while I’m working on a process he is right next to me and telling that same buddy of his that -“ if he starts anymore shit I’m Gonna go hunting at his house “ So I took that as a threat to me because there was no one else he had gotten into a confrontation with other than me.So I report it to HR and they take names and details from me about him. About his behavior out on the line. However , the only witness to the threat was him and his buddy so the threat may not even be taken seriously.",0
"Mechanic is not honoring the year warranty he gave Synopsis: September 2020: I had the engine of my Trailblazer SS replaced with a Corvette ls2.The mechanic invoiced me 3500 and told me he would cover any engine issues I had in the first year.

After changing the coolant the engine is still overheating, I contacted the mechanic and asked if he would still honor his warranty, he said ""you should have brought it in earlier""I know the timing is terrible, but the car has not moved since I parked it and the engine obviously has a leak in the coolant system.

" How can I deal with an insubordinate employee who is older than me? How can I deal with an insubordinate employee who is older than me?I am the assistant manager for the record. I have an older barista at the coffee shop I work at who refuses to listen to me. I will ask her to do something like take out the trash she will grab the barrel then spend 20 minutes sweeping the floors, another few minutes wiping down tables, then she will take out the trash. The issue I have with this is she has been told multiple times the trash barrel cannot be left outside the backdoor for more than a few minutes or we get a fine from the building for breaking fire code.She has been taught multiple times on how to make beverages to company standard, she will for the next drink or so do it correctly then immediately reverts back to how she has decided how to do it.She also sort of tells me to do things in a bossy manner like 'I am old I know better than you'. Like if she is taking one customer she will tell me to take the next one when they have told her they are ordering together.There is also an issue with her not washing her hands unless she has to use the bathroom but that's more of a health code thing.She has been here two months already and is not grasping the job at the pace we need her. She is still struggling with making the basics like lattes and cappuccinos and has just tuned any of us out unless its our boss telling her otherwise. My boss is here 1-2 days a week because she is also managing the neighboring store and they are 10 times busier than us and need more attention. (Corporate's decision not hers). So I am left in charge most days and am at a loss at what to do. Should I reach out to HR or should I try to talk to my boss about this?Edit:To clear up some things mentioned in the comments. I mention her age because I feel she is using it to justify why she shouldn't listen to anyone as if we are her kids or something. She listens to our boss probably because our boss hired her and help train her.The hand washing thing is I observe her wiping her face or nose in her hands and resume working. I ask her to wash her hands please and she just rinses them under the faucet for like 10 seconds or less then dries them.I do not sit there and breathe down her neck but when customers complain their drink was made wrong or she prepares the espresso first leaving the shots out to get cold before even putting milk in the steaming pitcher I have to remind her of the standard.",0

" I've reached 1 month since I was told an offer is coming... This whole situation is bizarre just looking for some thoughts on whether this should be concerning or not from people who work in the field.On 9/30 I was informed by my recruiter (a third party firm the company uses - not in-house) that I was the candidate they wanted to move forward to offer with. I was extremely excited. But that excitement faded a bit as days and weeks passed. To her credit, the recruiter proactively kept in touch over the last month every week or so telling me the same thing ""no news yet, I know they're still waiting on approvals for the offer."" Which I thought was odd to take so long, an offer in my experience always comes within a couple days not weeks. Budget cuts? Second guessing my fit?I got a bit more information yesterday as we approached the 1-month mark. She again apologized for no news yet, but this time added ""we are waiting on some approvals which I hope will make the offer more attractive.""That bit explains the delay if they had to re-grade the salary, but also kind of strange... I gave them my salary range months ago at the initial phone screen. And in fact, after going through the interview process, I felt as if I priced myself LOW and the top of the range I gave should really be more like the minimum I should accept.This is a massive international company with a HQ in Europe.As my friends and family keep checking in with me ""have you received the offer yet?"" they also give me their opinions that the company is messing with me, or maybe I'm not the first candidate, or maybe this is a sign it's not the greatest company to work for if it takes a month to piece together a job offer.After this latest email, I feel like I'm mentally preparing for a lowball offer, but I know it's not worth overthinking it until the offer actually comes. Adding to my unease is that I don't dislike my current company/employer, this is just a nice promotion and (I thought) would be a large raise.Looking for advice here on how I should frame my thinking, whether this is a yellow or red flag situation, and any questions I might want to ask when the offer does come in.",0

" Is my employer violating something here knowing my workplace accommodation? I seeked a few workplace reasonable accommodations months ago. I have migraines that make it hard for me to work longer than 8 hours. I have been at my company now for many years and recently have been getting horrible migraine flare ups. Yes, I have tried preventative and also abortive, they hardly do anything. I sometimes have to go to urgent care or the ER to get meds and IVs pumped into me because I cannot stop throwing up with a bad migraine. I used to work voluntary overtime all the time years ago at my current company and simply cannot anymore like I used to. Likewise, if I travel too long (passenger or driver it does not matter) then I get a migraine.

Months ago I sent a request to central headquarters about this all and they sent me some paperwork to fill out on official government forms. It should be noted that the industry I work in does say overtime is required to work the job, it says that right on the application in fact. However, there are always going to be people who get hurt at or outside of work who then are placed on ""light duty"" and are then given light duty work where there is no overtime. My request for the 8 hour work restriction was approved, but many people at my workplace do not understand this and it has caused some division. Our overtime for the next shift if we are short is mandated by an ordering system where say I should be getting forced to stay I am not since I have the 8 hour work accommodation through my headquarters. Is this legit though? What about what the job application and position description says where it says ""must be able to work overtime?"" Would I not be in violation with this with this approved accommodation?

This is not even the worst of it all. Our work site is near my home. However another work site over 200 miles away is very short staffed. That work site is so short staffed that central headquarters has been mandating work sites around the entire state to send a few staff each pay period to that desperately needed worksite (the worksite requiring people to help is about 50% vacant for staff). 2 staff where I work are being sent every pay period. A lit of who is going is made and you know months in advance. My boss who controls that list of people going knows I have the travel restriction and that it was approved. He put my name on the list anyway for December. My 50 mile travel restriction is ending in February 2023. So would this not be a violation of what central headquarters said?

Here is the thing: I would probably volunteer if I did not have this migraine stuff going on. I like doing what I do. But I CANNOT do it. I cannot travel 200 miles and do this. It would guarantee cause a migraine and then I would have to miss days of work. So a few weeks ago my response from central headquarters comes and they not only agree to me having an 8 hour work restriction but they likewise agree word for word ""Limit travel to 50 mi radius from work site-approved through February 28, 2023.""

My boss recently put me on a list of staff to go to this other worksite 200 miles away knowing what central headquarters HR had said regarding the travel restriction. I cannot believe it. Can they do this? My neurologist, myself and central headquarters HR are all on the same page in my opinion, for some reason my boss still thinks he can tell me I have to go. How should I address all this? Please give insights into this. Is this a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act? Please help.",0

"How does the calculation work for AER if the interest is paid monthly into the account? I feel like I'm being really sense, so I think I need some helpI recently started a savings account. It's got a variable interest rate, currently at 0.9% AER. The bank website says it ""illustrates what the interest rate would be if it was paid and compound once each year"". That bit (I think) I understand, it takes the balance once per year and adds 0.9% to it, right?My question comes from the fact that I chose to have the interest credited to my account monthly instead of annually. As far as I can tell, it'll still compound once per year, but I don't understand how the calculation would work. Will it assume the account balance at the end of the month is the balance it'll be at the end of the year and do ((x*0.9%)/12)?

" Is It Illegal To Record Livestreams? Hello friends,I've recently found myself getting into the hobby of collecting information on the internet. Mostly interesting articles about specific locations or bizzare videos from youtube.I don't share the stuff I collect with other people, I pretty much just archive it and then never look at it again. Strange, I know.Recently I've found the twitch community interesting, and want to record livestreams reflecting things I think will be important turning points in the company's history.Would recording prominent streamers' thoughts on rule changes, etc be considered illegal, even if I don't redistribute the videos? Furthermore, what sort of collecting is constituted as illegal online? Youtube videos? Livestreams? Articles?I enjoy the hobby of archiving interesting things, but I don't want to do it if I could find myself in legal trouble for it.",1

"What would happen to the US economy if all US citizens became debt free? Debt free is presented as a sign of financial victory and a milestone on becoming financially independent.

" Multiple accusations by my boss I’ve (32F, coder) been working for my company for a year and almost 5 months remotely. Since then, my boss has been accusing me of starting work late, leaving work early, and not working at all. This morning was the 4th time she’s asked me about my timestamps and productivity. I get paid salary so I don’t clock in or out. I’m an adult, I’m capable of keeping my schedule with full knowledge of being tracked on my work computer. These accusations has made my anxiety full blown to the extent where I hate my job now, afraid to get any type of emails from anyone, attend group meetings with the fear of getting called out, and thoughts I’ll be losing my job. My timestamps are based off a report of the coding system I use daily. Every morning I have my routine, 8am: turn on computer, open all applications, open emails, read and respond if need be. Takes about 12-14 mins before I actually start working, normal right? Even people who work IN OFFICE, do not run to their desk at 8am and start work right away. I used to work in office previously and not one person has ran to their desk at 8am and started working within mins. NEVER! So I’m at this point where I want to make a complaint to HR. The 3 previous times She’s accused me by email, I’ve responded with screenshots of my calendar, old emails, and explanations and NO RESPONSE from her! No peace of mind as an employee what so ever! Is going to HR a good idea or will it make things worse? I don’t feel safe at my job because of their inaccurate reports and my anxiety i through the roof everyday. Im currently looking for another job to leave but considering the holidays, it’s been difficult. Advice? I hate it here. Also, isn’t this harassment? I’ve told her MULTIPLE times those timestamps aren’t true!",0

" FMLA violation?? Since I've started on intermittent FMLA leave I have had both my supervisor and the big boss add job duties to my workload. My spouse has Non-Hodkins Lymphoma and I need to take him to his Chemo treatments or just care for him when he's been too weak to walk. They have both written me up for not being able to complete things by the time frame given me and causing major problems for the department. One of them even stated that ""They are productive when they are at the office, however..."" basically saying that 2 weeks earlier I had told my supervisor that I would be at the office 4 days per week, and then I ""called off"" (their words, not mine) 3 mornings that week and one whole day. Nothing said about why. It was because my spouse had new symptoms which were very unexpected and serious, just before his last Chemo treatment. So serious that he was admitted to the hospital.Again this week, he has had new symptoms and again I took FMLA to get him seen by the doctor. The result is scans, tests, and specialist doctor visits this week and next. I fully expect them to try to write me up again.I feel like I want to tell them that they are violating my FMLA leave, but I know they will see this as just me being defensive and will go through with it anyway.I just want confirmation that they are violating FMLA law, and if anyone can point me to where I can get printed information about this to use, that would be great.Thank you for your time, and assistance.",0

"What is the value of a stock in relation to the company? I don’t know a ton about finance or economics so I don’t know how to ask my questions in the most straight forward way. I may be asking the same question multiple ways or asking very different questions here so forgive me if some of this doesn’t make sense. I’m happy to try to clarify or discuss more if needed.Another way of phrasing my question might be What is the benefit of owning a stock other than being able to sell it to someone else? If I own a stock (or is it share?) of a company, can I do anything with it besides sell it to someone else at some point? Is there any inherent benefit in owning the stock itself?Why does an increase in profits for a company lead to people wanting to buy stock in that company? Is it just because the investment is seen as less risky because the company is less likely to go under? For example, if apple launches a new product lots of people will want to buy stock in Apple but they’re not going to actually see any of Apple’s profits so what makes Apple stock more valuable to them? I understand wanting to sell/not buy stock in a company who’s future is uncertain because off it shuts down no one will buy stock in a company that doesn’t exist. And I see where having lots of profit makes a company more likely to continue to exist in the future when you may still be holding a stock.Maybe it’s a more to do with the psychology of buyers. Is trading stock just about trying to predict what other people will want to buy rather than tied to any inherent value in the company itself?Thanks for any help! Hope this made sense. I tried googling for some answers but nothing I found actually got at these questions.",2
" What are some reasons an interviewer ghosts you after positive interviews?   I had a great first interview, about 45 mins. by Zoom. The manager said she could saw where she’d like to fit me in the team she’s building. The second interview was about 30 minutes with the company’s co-owner in Milan. Again, the conversation was good, and I had the impression they were very interested in me.    That was a week ago. Since then complete silence, no answer to 3 emails (the thank you, then a quick update of reference’s email address, and one this morning letting them know I am still very interested in the position.) No one has contacted my references.   Is it safe to assume they don’t want to move forward with me? What could be some reasons for this?    I have bad credit as a result of long medical treatment that made me unable to work. Could that be it?   I had a brief  part-time job this year that ended disastrously.

"My partner is being held in a Mexican psych facility against his will. What are my options? My partner was convinced to go to Mexico with his mother. They don't get along well as his family is Mormon and he has never agreed with their lifestyle and vice versa. If I can be as unbiased as possible, she is emotionally abusive and controls everyone in her life, besides my partner.Him and I have been together for almost a decade. She has never approved and thinks I'm a witch holding him with my powers. I always encouraged a relationship and told him to just grin and bear it because I thought he would regret it if he went no contact.After a series of bad choices and mishaps, we went to stay with his parents. She invited him to come to Mexico for a day, and I encouraged it, as per usual. Long story short, he didn't come home with herAlthough he did text me once and said, ""Mom is kidnapping me to a clinic in Aguascalientes. I love you,"" along with their location at that moment, I had no idea until she pulled into the driveway without him. This is mostly due to the fact that she told me outright on more than one occasion that they wre both on the way home, he simply wasn't feeling well. She also texted me from the number he was using at the time, pretending to be him and saying something similar (I know it was her bc it was broken english). A few times, she also texted me from the phone he used but it was simply a picture of their location. I figured he was not feeling well still, and decided to let him rest on the trip home.After talking it out, she said he would be gone up to 4 months. She told me i could take her car to visit the city where we were from and insisted I leave my pets and stuff behind. Within hours, she lied to my parents and essentially told them I stole her car. By the next day, she was saying she wanted nothing to do with me, and asked me to leave the tablet my partner and I bought in her car along with her car keys so she could go pick it up. She wanted the tablet so I couldn't have access to our bank accounts, since my partner - a disabled veteran medically retired from the military - receives a check every month. I thought that was bullshit because my partner would NEVER want them to have access to it over me, let alone want me to be left high and dry.It's been 4 months. I've heard NOTHING from him directly. His family claims he's not allowed to communicate, only his physhicatrist can. They have been allowed to send a short video or two and asked me to send one to them so they could forward it to the physician for my partner. On a few occasions, a staff-member has messaged me on FB. He swore me to secrecy and said he would lose his job, but it was implied that he gets along with my partner. (To me, since this place is very closed-off to everyone else, but he still reached out to me and risked it all just so my partner and I could commnicate, it means he thinks that my partner is different than the average patient they have there. He even called my SO his friend.)I have learned the followingHe will be there 6 months before he can leaveThis can change, because, in a letter my partner hand wrote and had the staff member send me pictures of, so I could show his parents, my partner said, ""they don't want to hear what i'm really thinking, and if I tell them, i'll be forced to stay longer.as per the employee and the letter my partner had him send, it's only his parents that can get him out. The employee told me even if i drove to Aguascalientes, his parents are the only ones who can get him out. And my partner's letter said that if they leave him in there 1 day over six months, they will never hear from him againHe has gained 60 pounds in 4 months. This along wiht his diagnosis, worries me. I have never heard any of his plethora of psych professionals mention anything close to this diagnosis, and it was always an issue that it seemed he had the OPPOSITE problem. I'm wondering if this diagnosis is because his mental health is actually deterioriating instead of getting better.",1

" Aggressive Co-Worker I have a co-worker (not supervisor) who has been acting aggressive by yelling, demeaning me. This isn’t the first time but the most recent situation was due to his belief that we should show up an hour early to be ready to start in case the team before us finishes early. I showed up 15 minutes before my scheduled time and he flipped out and escalated when I told him I wouldn’t show up an hour early just to sit around waiting. I spoke to my supervisor who said it wasn’t a policy and the co-worker couldn’t enforce that, but the supervisor is very non-confrontational and won’t do anything like speak to the co-worker about the behavior. Some other co-workers I asked about it said they wouldn’t show up early but he’s a well-liked guy so nobody’s vocally pushing back against it. I looked online to see if this issue could be reported to HR but all the definitions of workplace harassment or hostility are for protected categories or sexual in nature. He’s not doing that, just being incredibly unpleasant. Is this something that I could/should report to HR?

"Why isn't this considered discrimination or against the law? We can all agree that treating someone differently based on their race, gender, ethnicity, etc. is considered discrimination. One clear example of this is if a shop-owner refuses to serve customers of a certain skin color. They would rightly be called a racist, and they would either have to serve them or their shop would be forced to be closed. However, I was thinking, why isn't the reverse treated the same way? If a customer refuses to ever shop at any place whose owner is of a certain skin color, nothing would happen. They wouldn't be forced to shop at those places and there's nothing illegal about what they do (even though most would probably agree it's still racist).Take another example--if a landlord refuses to rent to tenants of color, then that would again be rightly condemned and against the law. However, if a tenant refuses to rent from a landlord solely due to the color of their skin, then that's fine. They can just find another landlord and nothing would happen. What they're doing isn't against any law. I feel like there's a double standard here...do you agree? What do you guys think?",1

Everything was fine, I had never made a late payment, never late on bills, kept it clean, etc. and two weeks before I moved my landlords informed me that I didn’t give them the 60 day notice and that I am not responsible for full rent for September as well ($825). I told them that I couldn’t afford paying rent in two separate places for one month since I am a single mother and barely making over minimum wage but would be willing to set up some kind of payment plan and that it would be in full. Anytime before this I would get a response within hours and now they won’t respond at all. My grace period ended as well for September and they are now charging me $20 a day until full rent is paid. I’m not sure if I wasn’t clear in the first notice I sent them and they can throw it out and say I only gave them a 30 day notice. But I can’t double check it since they won’t respond or send me a copy. In the lease it states 60 day notice on one page and 30 day notice on a different page. Im not sure where to go from here or what legal room I have. My mother loaned me the money to pay them off today at a total of $885, but neither of us really have the extra money to give them in the first place. They still have my deposit ($775) as well and I highly doubt I’ll get most of that back.",1
"Texting, right to privacy Do people have a right to privacy legally when texting with other people?For example, if I am having a conversation via text with a friend, and their partner reads through the texts without permission, is that legal?Given the “recorded nature” of written word, would it potentially be illegal for them to read texts if neither party consented?

"I am my line manager's PA, is there anyway to avoid putting them down as a reference?  I am currently applying for a new job because 1) my contract is up in one year and 2) My line manager never acts like a line manager, or like he cares about the part of the job that I support him with 3) Found a couple of interesting options. It would be very awkward for him to know I was looking for a new job, and he is TERRIBLE at answering emails so I know I would be the one reminding him to do my own reference. I know that I don't have to include him as a reference, but two would be standard, my previous manager is fine, but the one before that I can't work out if she is still in her role. I am a bit isolated here and I can't think of anyone else to in my current role to use as a reference.

" Question About Leave and Workplace Harassment Content warning for general discussion of trauma, particularly sexual harassment in the workplace.Hello HR pros, I’m seeking advice regarding a leave of absence situation. I have diagnosed PTSD resulting from a few different traumas, but notably a sexual harassment/assault that occurred a couple of years ago by a colleague. My company’s HR department was super supportive at the time that I made the report.At this point in time, I’m finally able to process everything that happened in therapy and I’m dealing with intense PTSD symptoms. My therapist believes that I need to take a month or more leave from work to focus on getting better while staying away from triggers.So my question has multiple parts:First, should I disclose my PTSD diagnosis to my company? What would be the benefits and drawbacks of this? Are there any accommodations I should ask for aside from time to attend my weekly therapy sessions?Next, if I do take leave, would there be any reason not to let my company know that the reason is due to the harassment/assault I experienced at work? Would this help with approvals, or would it make things more difficult?Finally, is there anything else I’m overlooking here?Thanks so much in advance.",0

"Using a charity to offset interest for personal loan A member of a charity is taking out a personal loan on behalf of a needy individual. The charity member is going to funnel that money through a religious charity in order to get a tax break and offset the loan interest.

"Questions about obtaining child abandonment There is a lot to unfold here so sorry if I seem like I am jumping around with the question. Firstly I live in Florida, I had a lengthy divorce with an excellent attorney. After 2 and a half years of waiting, Feb of 2020, I won sole custody of my children (currently 8 and 5 years old). My Ex-wife suffers from a series of major psychological issues and she was supposed to be evaluated by court order, but that never happened. Since then their mother (who is homeless and jobless) was in the picture every other weekend for about a year and stayed with her parents the weekends she had them.This year my children go to her parent's house and she is not there. Her parents who are 100% supportive of me and on my side of the situation, have told me that she has not seen or taken care of her kids for this year (2022). She no longer comes over to the house, and she has no contact with them or me. This includes the app Talking Parents.From what her parents tell me, is that she is out with a guy who is a commercial trucker and is traveling the country with him. Regardless, her whereabouts are unknown. I just want to have her parental rights removed. So she cannot arrive at my kid's school and take off with them. Her parents and I are worried that she might arrive one day and leave with them to wherever, My children are aware that they should not leave with their mother alone, but I can only trust so much that the school or daycare will not release them with her.  It would be easier if I have a note from the judge or state saying her parental rights have been removed, and the school has possession of this information.Some might tell me to hire my attorney from my divorce. I will if I have too, but I feel that I can do this on my own with her parents as witnesses, who are willing to testify against her. If there are forms I can fill them out or call whomever to start the process.(TL:DR)Basically, I just was curious if there is anyone familiar with FL law and how to have parental rights removed due to abandonment, and how to go about it.Thanks!",1

 How do I collect evidence for a hostile workspace investigation when I haven't been recording conversations and taking a lot of notes over the last year? A stakeholder from a different team reported my manager for creating a hostile work environment. HR reached out to me and seems to be taking it seriously. Reactions and comments the investigator made as I responded to questions and shared my experience made it sound like there is a case to be made. The investigator asked for more corroborating witnesses and as it's fairly large company so there are people on other teams who won't be intimidated by my manager. The investigator asked me to provide whatever evidence I have but I was pretty gaslit for a while and wasn't thinking of making recordings or taking copoius notes so I'm struggling a bit right now to get this process started and wondered if anyone here might have some advice.

"Requesting Fence Extension. What is “hardship”? For reference, I live in KS. We are going to present to our local city zoning board about extending our fence, which is already there and built to code, another 18 feet. This would put us one foot inside of our property line. The problem is that we are on a corner lot and there are ordinances around this. The city has accepted our appeal and votes tomorrow, but has some questions for us. I can see their notes, besides the design (standard see-through black aluminum fence), they question if their a hardship? To pass, we have to prove that a hardship exists. The fence is 62 feet long, so extra 18x62 feet is 1116 square feet of additional backyard that we could utilize as “backyard” for our dog and kids that we cannot now.

" Background Check (NYC) Hi everyone. I've been on reddit for many years (under a different name) and posting under this new username for personal reasons. I'm truly ashamed and embarrassed to ask this. So, I hope I can get some sincere advice from professionals on this sub reddit without any backlash or anything.I've been employed in the accounting profession for the last decade. Unfortunately, due to a parent's illness, and a very rough period in my marriage where spending and budgeting was a major source of conflict and disagreement between my spouse and I, we hit rock bottom and filed a chapter 13 approximately 2.5 years ago. The filing was dismissed 6 months after the filing date. After many years of excellent credit, my credit report looks like an utter mess. Many delinquencies, charge offs, collections and of course, the chapter 13 filing. A few months after the dismissal, my spouse and I came into some money and started settling all of our debts. While I still have about $36k in debt to settle, I am working with all of my creditors to settle these accounts and expect to be done by the end of this year.I've been interviewing with companies for inhouse Controller level positions and am worried sick that once they run my credit, I'll be rejected. I've just completed a second round interview with a company and things are looking promising. I have a family and am just trying to move up a bit and earn more to provide us with better living conditions. I should add that both my spouse and I have worked very hard over the last few years on our issues, and because we were essentially forced to live without credit for some time, we've learned much better money management techniques and work together as a couple when it comes to our finances. We've also been approved for a few credit cards too over the last year and have been using them very responsibly, making on time payments. We are doing really well today in terms of rebuilding positive credit history but until all of the derogatory stuff gets removed, our scores and report will look not good, to say the least. I don't think this matters much but my score is around 629 today, which is a massive improvement from 2.5 years ago.My apologies for the long wall of a post but I'm just wondering if anyone can offer some real world advice. It's embarrassing to me to have filed, and it's been eating away at me for years and will continue to, but even more so in that the field I work in is generally thought to be synonymous with handling finances (while I do check up on account balances, I really don't manage money or deal with it in the way the general masses think in any of my accounting positions). Would greatly appreciate any advice/comments on how to handle this situation like this. Thank you!",0

" Employer treating me unfairly with vehicle assignment. What can I do? My boss (Second in charge) keeps assigning me the same vehicle everyday while giving everyone else different. While I normally don't care about the vehicle I am in, the vehicle he assigns me (crown victoria) is very cramped and is hurting my leg (We have a prisoner partition in the vehicles and the way it is Setup it causes the seat to sit very forward, making me have to sit at a weird angle that causes pain to my leg. (I have tendon problem with my left knee that if im not carful, tends to get injured and ends up putting me in a leg immobilizer until it heals)When making this known to the boss, he puts me in another vehicle that is the same (we only have two crown vics that are setup the same), the rest are SUV's which are WAY more spacious and bigger). I politely asked if there was a way I could be transferred into a SUV instead. He asked why and I explained. He told me that the SUV's were more cramped (which is a lie). He then told me to go look at the other crown victoria (which is set up the same) and asked me to see if it had foot adjustment pedals.I told him that it was not a issue with the pedals but a issue with my LEFT leg, the angle I have to sit in those vehicles because of the cage, and the getting low to get inside the vehicle. He got upset and told me to bring him the vehicle board. so I did. He assigns me the crown vic he told me to look at. Instead of continuing to argue further, I just accept it and painfully take the vehicle because I feel to embarrassed to be complaining over something as silly as a car.I decided to start documenting the vehicles in which he assigns. I found that only myself and another employee whom everyone dislikes for childish reasons tends to always be assigned the same vehicle. This other co-worker has about 7+ years with the company. I've personally heard and seen employee level supervisors give him the worst vehicles in the fleet because they claim ""he smells"" (which is completely childish).Like I said, I don't care about the vehicle im in, but I am getting upset how they constantly treat both myself and this other employee differently to everyone else. I am not a bad employee. I left for 4 months, and was called to come back (did 3 years with the company prior). I'm the first one there (showing up early) and the first to leave (all my equipment is turned in and work is done and am waiting by my car while everyone else is still getting gas at the gas station for the vehicles.)Speaking to a employee level supervisor, I got his opinion on what he thought about me asking the second in charge the question. He said It wasn't going to work because I was considered ""new"" again. Except we just got a guy who got hired on after me. He's getting the SUV every night. Both myself and the other employee whom I mentioned are given the same vehicle. So the issue on ""Seniority"" is not exactly there. I personally feel I am being discriminated against and that the boss's actions are intentional and not just ""coincidental""",1

"Can this apartment issue escalate? Can this issue escalate?

I moved to this apartment complex in California and took on this lease mostly for its attractive amenities such as the pool, weight room, conference rooms, pet washing station, game room, lounges, cafe deli, etc.

I’ve been here for 4 months now and I’m already very dissatisfied because all the amenities are closed due to covid. I understand these things must be shut down because of covid but some things aren’t even built yet but on their website it says they have it.

Community wifi was listed but it’s not even set up (not even covid related) they said they have a cafe and deli but I see none??

The weight room and poop recently opened but it’s reservation only. The game room isn’t even built, the lounges are closed, conference rooms are closed, my dog hasn’t had a bath since we moved here because I was and still do expect to use the pet wash station.

I pay a little over $1700 for a studio... and to have 0 access to use my amenities. I feel like there should be a rent adjustment because of covid, but they just shut down amenities and made everyone pay the same during the pandemic.

I feel like I’ve been deceived and mislead. I’ve talked to other tenants here and they fee the same but many are trapped in their lease like I am.

For the average person this probably won’t be a problem but for someone with a chronic health condition (like me), it is going to be significantly more expensive than the previous package.I don’t expect them to change anything this year and I do understand that rates are going up and my employer is trying to adjust…but I’m wondering if it’s worth providing feedback that this is a hardship for me.

"Starting Business: What Do / Legal Requirements All I want is to do everything correctly legally speaking. I'm in Pennsylvania as I'm sure that's important. About 4 years ago I put $20 into Robinhood, got it to $40, pulled out $20. I was doing other things primarily and barely payed any mind to it.Fast forward to November of 2020. I have gotten up to $200 and I start to pay more attention. Noticed BTC fighting 20k hard. Dropped it all in MARA just before 10x jump over about a month. It was at this point I came up with the idea that if I hit a  $10k portfolio, I would be able make more than my expenses by well timed trades. (I was making more per week from an essentially free app then my Engineering job)In October 2020, I recognized a peak in MARA and a reversal in SNDL. I moved it all into that for a ride up another 5x till they approved the possible dilution of almost twice their shares in January. Sold all after that announcement. I quit my job in December.It was at this time GME had it's gamma squeeze to which I definitely bought a few at the top since I had some fresh cash to burn.

"(Los Angeles, CA) how could I get out of my lease without breaking it over not having clean water/negligent landlord? 2 of the 3 months I've been here I haven't had clean water but can't afford to break lease or be evicted Hi, currently in an apartment that I thought was a score but unfortunately is an older building with not-maintained pipes. Over a month ago a notice went out to all tenants that the pipes/tanks were being flushed and since then my shower water has been unusable even with trying various filters. The water's so hard and smells really metallic and stains the tub red where the water lands. I have pictures. Thankfully the smell and redness is gone for now with the latest filter, but the water is still so hard (maybe not even the right word, I'm from southern california and a swimmer, I'm used to hard water...but never had hard water *burn* my skin and make it flake and peel, or make my hair fall out and break pretty much immediately or be dry like straw on contact...making it impossible to wash hair).Without a filter the water reads at 350ppm in a glass cup and while the water is finally no longer red on contact, it's so cloudy you can't really see through until the particle settle. After a filter (and I've tried many) it's still about 350ppm.I've been showering at my friend's place across town in the meantime but this isn't sustainable and frankly I'm about ready to move into her building where this isn't an issue and the landlord isn't so negligent and an asshole - how am I paying the same rent to not be able to use a shower or have clean water?I did put in multiple maintenance requests and plumbing requests in writing and my landlord sent the on site maintenance guy...who's an incompetent idiot in every way, and then also sent a plumber. The plumber said he'd have to investigate the pipes/tanks/system and I'd hear from him. I got an email from my landlord that said he didn't find anything wrong and basically eat shit because ""no one else is having these problems."" I sent her pictures of the red staining and a video of how it's definitely the water after it hits a surface, it's a clean tub too. I also know my next door neighbor is also having plumbing issues because their roof started leaking smelly yellow water and the LL took forever to have a shoddy patch job done. Their lease ended recently and I think they moved.Now my question: is it possible to get out of my lease for not having access to clean water...or even just clean enough to shower in and not smell worse after the shower than before (the metallic smell is INTENSE)? I'm only 3 months into my lease and 2 of those 3 months I haven't had clean running water, but there's so much time left that I wouldn't be able to afford to break the lease and pay the remainder easily (after living here it's pretty clear that the units aren't in high demand yet the ll keeps raising the rents...so many remain empty and with how negligent my landlord is I feel like I can safely assume that my unit likely won't get quickly rented out).",1
"Water Damage from Neighbor In US, in state of Ohio....  On the edges of a small city, there is a road that goes down a pretty sharp hill.  There are 5 houses along one side of this road, and they are approximately 125 feet away from each other.  The 2nd house along the road belongs to my parents.  The first house (at the top of the hill) has their rain gutters going to the middle of their property, along the bottom edge of the property.  In short, whenever it rains, the water starts flooding right against my parents property.  My parent's house is probably 10 feet from the property line, and is starting to see water issues.  Dirt is being washed away from the side of their house, and dirt is being washed away from under their driveway.They have talked to the neighbor, and he refuses to direct the water to the street, or anywhere else.  Is there anything they can do to force the neighbor to change where he is directly his rain gutters?",1
" I said it was possible to be racist against white people. I (26M) considered my coworker (24F) - let's call her Jasmine - to be a close friend. We've been working in the same place for a couple years. She said if it weren't for me and one other coworker – let’s call her Rachel - she would have quit the first month. We shared very personal things like when she had a crush on someone in the workplace, or when I got in trouble for telling my mother my girlfriend had a UTI. I've gone ice skating with her and she had RSVP’d for my wedding. This changed one day a couple months ago. There are two incidences which could have caused offence, probably a combination of both.First thing in the morning, my supervisor asked me to help Jasmine with something. I wasn’t sure what the purpose of her experiment was, so I got confused after he gave instructions. She didn’t seem completely sure either because she’d initially gotten the wrong number of test tubes. I smiled, and asked her to explain it to me, but she got impatient and told me to go do my part. I would understand the need for this if we were running out of time, but we weren’t. I went to clarify with our supervisor. We were doing everything correctly, but my understanding of what Jasmine was doing was wrong. I think she was angry and felt patronized because I doubted her.Second encounter: My coworkers and I eat lunch together. It's not uncommon for us to have little debates about issues like politics, abortion, race, dating, circumcision, religion, or drugs. These discussions can get intense but always end in mutual respect. I walked into a discussion started by another coworker. Rachel asked Jasmine, “Do you think people can be racist against white people?”“No, because they are the ones in power.” Rachel agreed with her.I added my opinion, “I think they can be, white people don't have power in every situation or country. It might be different if we were in South Africa. Racial discrimination usually goes one way but it can go the other way, just like with sexism. I've talked to another coworker about this.”“What did he say?” Jasmine asked.“He said his understanding of the word ‘racism’ was any discrimination based on race, but that he had a friend who thought it had to involve systemic oppression.” I think it was around this time that Jasmine got up and left. I continued talking to Rachel, but I felt bad because it was obvious Jasmine was upset with me.After an hour or two I went to her bench, “Do you have some time to talk?”“Why?”“I feel like you’re mad at me.” I whispered.",0

"After my last injury I suffered another injury. My workplace is denying me to WFH or utilize medical leave despite my injuries being worse. This is after a long period of harassment targeted at myself. I contacted my employer’s personnel department and they ignored me. Missouri: Long story short, my ankle was sprained a few weeks ago. They initially thought it was broken, but apparently just a really bad sprain. Since we’re on our feet a lot at work, the doctor said I should WFH in the meantime until I’d improved enough with physical therapy. I was on a crutch, with a boot. I could move around, but only with difficulty and it was impractical for me to be in the office since we are expected to constantly get up and move around to help customers and clients.My work initially denied this, and made me miss several days continually moving the goalposts as to what paperwork was “required” to make this happen. Other employees are not subject to this kind of treatment, which I’ll describe further in a bit. Finally they agreed to it. Shortly thereafter, I was attacked by a dog, which greatly damaged my right hand and also sprained my right foot (it was kicked into a solid wall as I tried to extricate myself). The doctor said that I should again WFH since now I was in an even worse situation physically, now with boot moved to opposite foot, ankle brace on the other one and a busted right wrist that makes it painful to type and write, even with a wrist brace, and provided a note that I had them fax to my employer.My employer responded that they were simply denying it this time. I had to be in on Monday, even disregarding the fact that I have yet another appointment that day for further treatment of my wrist.I can name off several employees in my office who I have personally witnessed not being subjected to this treatment for similar injuries such as lower-extremity sprains, but my workplace has consistently harassed me for over a year. I have been screamed at and threatened in full view of the public; I have been forced to sit in my boss’s office repeatedly being accused of lying (I WASN’T), then had that boss call my other boss and demand I go to his office after she told him I refused to admit I was lying about breaking policy (I WAS NOT LYING), an interrogation that left me literally in tears as they berated me in his office for almost half an hour; I have had paperwork ripped out of my hands; been subjected to sexual harassment twice - the first time, my boss dismissed it as “not real” (they sent me multiple damn notes in the mail) but said that I didn’t have to talk to this person if I didn’t wish to do so, and within days my other boss transferred this person to my phone specifically, and the second time I was apparently supposed to take it as a compliment; I have had my chair and desk blocked off by my boss as she first insisted that whatever I was doing “wasn’t work and was personal” (it wasn’t, it was literally work) and then demand that I print out the work I was doing to give her and continued to berate me regardless, with no explanation as to what she was doing with the printout and then blocked from leaving my desk again as she continued with a hateful lecture; been told to come in if I was afraid I had COVID, against policy; have been accused of lying on multiple occasions; had another coworker apparently recruited to watch my computer monitor and report if they think I’m not working hard enough; and have overheard my boss say bad things about me and gossip about me on her phone; and have been told that family emergencies and illness are just “excuses” that I make up or exaggerate to “get out of work”. There is a massive generational divide in my office, I am the youngest person by several decades, and they have always seemed to dislike me for that. They make assumptions about me (basically “snowflake Millennial” garbage) and hate me on that basis. One of them literally laughs and shakes her head every time I enter the room.I can’t do this anymore. I contacted the Personnel Dept last week (our HR department) to discuss my treatment there, and they simply never responded to anything. I am at my wits’ end and in tears at the thought of going back - having to painfully stumble into the building, to no doubt be criticized as soon as I enter for whatever the hell it’ll be this time. On a good day, I’m subjected to the silent treatment, yelled at for transferring calls to the people for whom they were intended because they didn’t feel like talking, reminded that whatever I say (such as “Women who report rape aren’t just making it up, and can we please stop talking about a personally triggering subject in the office”) is ignorant and baby-like, and treated like I’m an idiot if I ask a question, but also I’m an idiot if I don’t ask it and end up not doing something right.

"Is it legal to hack terrorists and steal from them? I know in the US it is illegal to hack into someone else's computer, but what if the target was say ISIS or the Taliban and the computer was in a different country? Obviously we don't have an extradition treaty with Afghanistan. Would the US government even care if you stole millions of dollars from terrorists? Technically you would be preventing terrorist acts as that money would otherwise be used to fund terrorist attacks. And what if those terrorists were in America? Say someone discovered the 9/11 attackers beforehand and stole all of their money before calling the FBI to turn them in, would they be in trouble at all or allowed to keep the money?Edit: I ask because this is how Russia operates. Russian hackers are encouraged to attack foreign countries and are left alone as long as they don't target anyone in Russia. That's why so many hacks originate in Russia these days.",1

"Is my auto loan interest fair? My credit score through Credit Karma was 801 through TransUnion (Currently at 806).  I live in Southern California and I purchased a roughly $18,600 car after taxes and fees. I put $9900 down cash.  My loan amount was $8633.52 for 36 months.  I thought I'd get a fairly low interest rate but dealer told me it is 5.19%  I was like wtf that seems kind of high but I didn't want to go through the hassle of going to banks for loan and negotiations so I just went with it.  For a guy that has 801 credit score, how high does 5.1% feel for a $8633.52 loan?",2
" October healthcare premium ($480) was wrongly auto drafted from my personal checking on 9/30 and I haven’t gotten it back yet. I was self-employed for almost two years and had purchased an individual healthcare plan directly from the insurance company. Signed up for auto pay. Easy peasy.At my new job, they don’t offer group health insurance. Instead, they offer dollar amount per month to cover whatever individual plan you want to purchase. They use a third party company to handle this. So my job pays the third party, then the third party handles all enrollment and pays each employee’s individual plan each month.When I got this job, I upgraded to a better plan with my existing health insurance company. I called them to let them know that I was cancelling the old plan and that my company would be paying the premium for my new plan. They seemed to understand.Towards the end of August, the September premium was paid by the third party company. Great.Then, on 9/30, my October premium was auto drafted from my small business checking account. Same as when I was self employed.I was fighting with the insurance company for two weeks after that because I never signed up for auto pay on the new plan. Only the old plan that was cancelled. They said too bad, the auto pay rolled over to the new plan because it was tied to my account and not the plan itself? Fine, whatever.In the meantime, in the middle of October, the third party made another premium payment that the insurance company allocated to November.The third party told me to ask the insurance company to refund the 9/30 payment and allocate the most recent payment to October, because that’s the month it was intended for. Insurance company refused. The third party said they’d look into it almost a week ago. My boss said she’d talk to the higher ups at our company again over a week ago and I haven’t heard back.Our one HR person (small company) has been aware of this situation for a month now and I haven’t heard from her.Someone owes me $480, right? Who, though? My company, the third party we pay to handle health insurance, or the insurance company?",0
"Barred from a city property. So…this is the condensed version of what occurred.  I worked at a municipal golf course for about 13 months from summer 20 to summer 21.  It started out good.  My boss told me that I was the best help he (20+yr career)ever hired.  During my employment my alcoholism and marijuana usage started to effect my performance and my personal life.  I took a leave of absence to attend a 26 day rehab program.  My boss told me that I would have a job once I returned and he delivered on that promise.  When I came back to work, I returned to top form and he told me as much.  Unfortunately, my marriage took a hit as a result of my actions prior to rehab and had all the signs of divorce.  I knew I couldn’t support myself on 9$/hr so I left the job on good terms and moved to the town over to attend CDL school.  A few weeks after I quit, I signed up to play in a weekend tournament and was taken off the tee sheet.  Come to find out, my boss has gotten lazy with the day’s deposits and had been stuffing them away in his desk instead of taking them to the bank.  After I had left, he had decided to deposit all the days earnings that had piled up in his desk.  There was approximately 50,000$ missing.  He told the head pro and immediately I became the one and only suspect.  My boss tried to convince the head pro that he didn’t think I was the thief but the HP wouldn’t listen.  Since there was no camera in the office, there was no proof that I was involved.  I was banned from playing at the course.  It was determined that they wouldn’t seek legal recourse and that I needed to stay away.I guess I should be happy that I’m not in a fight for my freedom but the ban effectively took away my hobby and most of my social interaction.  There aren’t many courses close to my house and all of my friends play at this course. Anyone with 5 mins of unsupervised access to the office could have taken the money and that is a long list of people. I’m not real sure how long the theft went on but I was lead to believe is was between the time that I was hired and my rehab stint.I guess I’m posting this to determine if this ban is enforceable given the circumstances.  Also, what steps could I take to fight it if I chose to do so?",1
" Quitting during holiday break, or during paid vacation after - how will payment work? My husband currently works in a school (Instructional Aide in California) and gets salary paid monthly. However we are moving soon out of country and considering moving during the winter break (last 2 weeks of December and first week January) and therefore needing to quit.He is salary and doesn’t really get paid holidays, but rather the same amount every month for almost the whole year, including December and January even though they include the winter break. We are confused whether he will still get paid his regular salary for all of December if he puts in his resignation during the break (on January 1 for example). Or if we have him take paid vacation time to extend that break another few weeks (so he would last be physically present at work in mid December) but resigns during that vacation time, will his paycheck reflect only the 2 weeks he actually worked in December and the 2 weeks of vacation time VS being paid all of December?Edit: Or more simply, what can he expect his December and January paychecks to look like if he resigns January 1 for example( still during winter break) or if he adds 2 weeks paid vacation time to the winter break and quits during that vacation time in January.We are hoping to at least have his full December paycheck.I hope that’s clear!

 My bf works for Terminix in NJ and they didn’t pay him for all the hours he was clocked in for One day his work truck broke down.  We had to drive pretty far away to find a shop that they had a contract with that could take it that day.  He made his manager aware of what was happening and he clocked in that day even though he couldn’t go to stops because it wasn’t his fault and he was dealing with getting their truck fixed.  His manager didn’t say anything to him but changed his hours and didn’t pay him for that day.  He went to his manager’s manager who said you should have come to me beforehand… not sure how he could have known his manager was going to change his hours.. is what they did ok?  It seems so wrong to me but I’ve been salaried my whole life so I don’t totally get how it works.  He’s a full time employee with benefits but is paid hourly.,0
" Is this a normal interview process? Over a month ago I interviewed for a job. They were hiring for a few different positions in that department. One posting went up shortly after I applied for the job I interviewed for.My interview went well, they immediately asked for references and a potential start date. I heard from a reference that they had contacted them, a second reference said they received one call and attempted to contact them back and was never contacted again. I believe my third reference spoke to them as well.So I made a follow up call, just to ask if they needed or wanted any other information and to touch base about the position. Weeks go by, and I heard nothing until late in the day before a long weekend that they wanted to interview me for a different position. Didn't say much about this other position so I requested information on it. Initially I accepted the interview as I was a little familiar with the role, but after reviewing the job description and speaking with others more familiar with what that position entailed I decided it was not for me and declined the interview.She asked if I was still interested in the other job I applied for or if she should remove my name from the list. I'm still interested in this other job but now I'm a little unsure of this program/department at all. It's been over a month since my interview and two months since I even applied. I'm working full-time right now just looking to move up to a better job but I'm in no immediate need for a job so I'm trying to be patient.So i guess my question is, is this normal? Should I be concerned? Have I damaged my chances of being offered the original job? HELP!",0

" Should I ask for more than I want or exactly what I want during negotiations with headhunters and hiring managers? I am always between two uncomfortable spots: worried I am asking for too much which will turn off the potential employer, and worried I am being super naïve in negotiations and letting myself get run over. Maybe the former concern is a silly one to have though?For additional context, I work in logistics and have 8 years of experience in the field but only at the entry level and lowest management tiers (managing work but not people).

" Why don't personal loan rates track with the central bank base rate? Over the last few months, the Bank of England (BOE) has raised the base rate from 0.5% to 1.25% (and the expectation is it will go higher).Anything that directly tracks with it (such as a tracker mortgage) has, of course, gone up exactly in line.Other types of mortgage product such as fixed-rate mortgages have also gone up - not directly tracking, but certainly correlating.However, personal loans are still available at the 2.8/2.9% they have been for years. How come they don't appear to correlate with the base rate?",2
" Unproductive Employees Finally Being Held Accountable and Screaming ""BULLY!"" Unproductive Employees Finally Being Held Accountable Reporting me as a Bully - ILLINOISHi everyone I wanted to explain a situation I'm in and see if anyone can offer advice. This has really been bothering me and so I truly appreciate any insight here.So I work in a pretty stressful environment in a retail setting. I'm a supervisor during my shift when my manager isn't there which is usually only about half of my shift. I am not a manager, but when my mgr isn't present I lead the team of 4-5.One thing I've realized is my manager who's these peoples' actual boss is extremely non confrontational. She does not like to have difficult conversations with subordinates and usually ends up picking up their slack. They get away with doing 70% of their job when working with her because they know they won't be held accountable. She's actually really nice to them as well. Overall, she's just an extremely nice person and very hard-working.Now about me... I'm not so nice in all honesty. Sure, I am kind and I care about others. I don't have any pre conceived notions about protected classes or any specific employee. As of lately, though, I have been trying to hold them accountable.I believe they ask me questions they already know the answer to in an attempt to get me to just do their work for them. So I've been more short and condescending when they ask me these questions. I don't laugh and joke with them and I am literally trying to show them I am not their friend and I don't care to make small talk. I just want to do my job, supervise them doing theirs, and go home. That's it.I'll admit as well my tone is pretty rude (knowingly to get the point across I'm not happy with their laziness). I also demand things of them without asking politely like I used to. I am generally pretty stand-offish and act like I'm above them, because I am.I know I sound like a major asshole but this is only me at work. When I work with other teams who are accountable and productive I get along with everyone great.Recently 3 of the 4 of them got together and reported me to HR and my boss' boss. An investigation occurred in which case they read me statements made my TM's that were completely out of context. They failed to mention their laziness, lack of productivity, and accountability. When HR was reading the statements it painted me in a light as of I'm a bully for no reason. I know they don't like me. I'm rude and I won't pick up their slack.Now I'm worried for my job. What can I expect? Please ask for more details if needed and I'm happy to share. I know for certain I did not discriminate against a protected class, but yes, I am pretty rude and short with them and no I don't like any of them...",0
"Wrong salary in contract?  Hi,I applied for a principal role which was above my experience level, with appertained salary expectation range of 960-1020 000 per annum.I did very well in the interview process and they decided to give me an offer. However, ""as not to rock the boat” in the company/team with older people having the principal role I was given the title of senior.I will have the same responsibilities as in the principal role, but the recruiter told me that this would lead to a lower salary, 750 000 per annum. I accepted it as I think the company and position is a great fit for me.Now they sent me the contract for me to sign and it suddenly states a salary of 990 000 per annum, matching my salary expectation of the initial role. Keep in mind that it took them quite some time sending me this contract since ""it had to be verified by the HR director"". The tile stated in the contract was the senior role and not the principal role, so they at least changed that.Should I ask them what happened here, or just wait it out until I get the first salary?Could the recruiter have been mistaken or did the HR people mess up?",0

It might not pan out but I want to see the legal differences between a human and a mega corporation.It might not pan out, I think another way to solve the issue is to punish people for using this law frivolously in a way that does not restrict peoples ability to sue but still had a punishment for suing small business’s and regular citizens.",1

"Domino’s Tip Theft? Hi everyone, I just started a job as a cook and customer service rep for a local Domino’s in Pennsylvania. Typically, in other pizza shops I’ve worked, the credit card tips are put in and split every time someone’s shift ends. We also pool cash tips.Today was my second day and the first day, I forgot to ask for my tips. Oh well, move on. But today, I saw that there was a large amount tipped and remembered to ask how to split the tips before I clocked out. I was told by the manager that we don’t get credit card tips and can only receive cash tips. The manager said that the people who get the tips are the morning and evening managers “because they’re at fault if the till is short.”Is this legal? I’ve been trying to Google and I can’t find anything because this is pretty specific and it doesn’t apply to the delivery drivers. They get all of their credit card tips. Thanks so much in advance for the responses and sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile.UpdateOops, sorry. I didn’t post an update. I called the labor board and corporate. Corporate barely cared and just decided to tell my boss that I had called by “contacting their HR” and sending a complaint to them (the same kind if a customer comes and has a bad experience so they complain to corporate). I contacted them on the same day. My boss caught wind and 100% turned around and started to let us keep our credit card tips but I’m not 100% sure he’s splitting all of it. For starters, the manager is getting a cut which is bs because he’s salary. Also, at the end of the night, the tip pool only pays out a buck a person. I know people tip less bc we’re a chain and such, but it doesn’t sound like all we got for a night was a total of $3-4 (depending on how many people are working). The labor board called me to get my take the day after they made this change. They said since they changed, there’s nothing they could do. If I or any current or former employees wanted back payment on tips, then they would have to have an exact dollar amount down to the penny on what they missed out on. Except, the manager doesn’t teach us how to check the progression of the tips and how much we’re actually owed. So, yeah. We’re getting money, but we’re still being swindled.",1

"Working remotely with non-communicative manager and  Hello,My manager and I both live in Florida but work for a global ""ad"" agency headquartered in Illinois.Situation:I'm seven months into a new position having been recruited by my manager directly. Our small team is 100% remote and the culture seems to be heavily reliant on chat and emails and is very meeting-averse. This usually results in tasks being assigned via long format emails or very quick chat messages with links to Google Docs and/or presentation decks, followed by a very brief and unstructured 30-minute MS Teams call.Over the last several projects, I've received assignments that lacked clear direction or were so vague that it required more detailed instruction and specifics regarding the actual action to be made, the people involved, and roles and responsibilities. We've had several miscommunication mishaps over the months as a result of us not being aligned.  I've made several recommendations on how to resolve some of these issues, but these have usually been met with a ""no.""Most of the issues I've identified are the result of lack of clarity, lack of information, or limited knowledge. I don't want to put my manager in a bad position, and have asked for a meeting to discuss these situations and resolve them, but my manager appears to be resistant to it. We are supposed to have weekly catch-ups, which consistently get canceled (usually 5 minutes before the scheduled meeting). Sometimes these meetings are rescheduled and canceled again, or canceled and never rescheduled.More specific to my question for this group: I worry that this behavior is going to reflect poorly on my performance and personal record with the company (which I really like and would like to stay at). I feel like I'm trying to do everything I can to resolve the situation but am running into walls. I'm over-communicating, sending weekly and sometimes daily reports/updates, taking initiative where possible, and delivering above and beyond when possible. But I feel these attempts are actually making it worse. There have been times my manager and I won't communicate for a week or more, or situations where I'm assigned projects, make a suggestion that my manager is opposed to... then I'm suddenly removed from the project only to find out later that my junior colleague took it over and implemented the suggestion I originally made. And, because the work we do is design/communications-related, I've offered to take part in any presentation meetings to help present these concepts and ideas, but have never been invited.It's been 7 months and I still haven't met anyone outside of my immediate team. And so I can't tell if this behavior is isolated to our small team, or is indicative of the entire organization culture.In August, every employee at the company was supposed to have their annual review meeting to define their personal objectives and KPIs. It's October and I haven't had mine yet. My colleague has had hers, but the last few times my review was scheduled, it was canceled.What are my options? Do I report this to HR? Do I have any recourse? Should I look for another position in the company or just move on?",0

Does the law firm have a hidden agenda after contacting us?! I don’t think there’s a lawsuit possible. My daughter(18) went to a party three months ago. The party had the proper permits and everything from the city and the police department. The only thing police specifically stated was that the party must have officers there to check everyone for contraband and weapons before they could enter.Well somehow guns got into the party and they were shot off. Multiple people got hit and a handful died from it. Luckily my daughter barely survived after getting shot in the head. Yet she’ll forever have a lifetime of doctor visits with specialist a neurologist due to the place where she was shot(if they attempt to remove the bullet she will die).A “famous” law-firm in the big city a town over said there could potentially be a case against the police department since it’s been proven somehow that the women going into the party’s weren’t being searched and later on not contacting us about information with the case. Idk if any of that is true but they offered to take on the case we wouldn’t have to pay them anything until they win and they’d like to get 40% of whatever it is.I have my doubts on there being an actual case against the police department or that they expect us to not have to pay them anything even if it takes years until we win.I guess I just need some others thoughts on the situation and I understand the insight on the situation should be taken with a grain of salt. Thank you.,1
" Taking on more direct reports - should I ask to review my pay? I’ve been in my current role for under a year.

" What constitutes harassment? Hi, apologies in advance for the super long post. I recently got a promotion at my job where I will be overseeing the department that I have been part of for the last four years. Another woman that I work with very much wanted this position as well, but management felt she wasn’t a right fit (you’ll see why shortly lol).For months now, before I even got the promotion, she’s been telling our entire team that she’s going to be extremely upset if I get it over her. She also tries to get them to say bad stuff about me, usually by asking leading questions that start with “don’t you think…?” Like, “don’t you think laceybaghands is unapproachable?” And “don’t you think I help you WAY more than laceybaghands?”She then takes these responses and  goes to management and is like, I’m just concerned because so and so said this this and this about laceybaghands. She basically acts like she’s doing them a favor, because they’re too “afraid” to speak up. Just for reference, I’ve never had a problem with anyone on my team, and I actually have a great individual relationship with everyone (hence why I got the promotion lol)She’s been asked to stop speaking for others by our boss, but then she has a meltdown, telling everyone she’s been silenced and not allowed to speak her mind.I feel like this is bordering on harassment. I am absolutely sick of the gossip, and I can already feel it affect my ability to do my job. My feeling is that she’s been trying and will continue to try to turn my team against me, in the hopes that either it’ll make my job harder, or they will revolt and be like NO, WE WANT HER INSTEAD.The thing is 1) She is not yet a direct report to me for the time being. 2) She has not said any of these things in my presence, this is all second hand coming from people on my team and my boss.So I’m wondering what I should do. Should I have a direct conversation with her first, and then go to HR if it doesn’t stop? Should I let my boss know I feel harassed? Should I just go straight to HR?

"Florida - Are providers required by law to provide a hard copy of post-op instructions for outpatient procedures? A friend of mine had PRK eye surgery, but they gave her post-op instructions for your run of the mill Lasik procedure. The recovery for PRK is a couple weeks where recovery time for Lasik is by and large a couple days.They gave her the post-op instructions for Lasik which were incorrect and insufficient. She is in a not-insignificant amount of pain still and it’s been over a week since the procedure and she’s concerned there is a something to be really worried about.The doctor’s office is telling her that the 10+ year old video that she watch prior to her procedure was sufficient delivery of post-op care, but she maintains that the video covered only Lasik, and not PRK.Is there any recourse here if there is lasting damage due to what seems to be negligence on the part of the doctor’s office?",1

"Non-compete as a software customer This may be routed in urban legend / just used as scare tactics, but I've heard of people receiving 'cease and desist' orders for creating competing software while being a customer of another software vendor. I am referring to, for the sake of example, unemployed persons.Let's say I have a good idea for a chat platform. I've heard of people getting letters telling them to 'cease and desist' on projects that could take revenue away from an existing platform (D--cord).  I would get it if you were violating a patent AND generating revenue, but from what I've heard this is not the case. They are simply saying 'since you saw our product, you are not allowed to attempt to make anything that could ever compete with it times infinity.'How accurate is that? How likely are they to win in court by suing an ex-customer? Do I need to start reading my EULAs more carefully?This parallels me buying an Apple Flavored Yankee Candle, burning it, realizing I don't like the smell. So I  hunt down a specific type of apple, mixing it with various spices like video games and bandwidth, and create a new gamer candle. Yankee Candle can't come at me and say 'You need to stopped making candles cuz you bought one of ours.' -- right?To me this is just a scare tactic. AFAIK 'cease and desist' letters could be sent to everyone in the world because they MIGHT be violating a patent. Making it very easy to manipulate people into acting out of fear rather than intelligence. Are they violating the patent? No. Could an attorney still send them a letter (not a lawyer, but I think the answer is yes).Also, I've seen this more as a CYA thing than actual predatory legal practices, but the opportunity is there for it to become so. Trying to learn what I don't know so I can cut off bogus legal threats if I encounter them.",1

"How can I get 14 million HUF (44,5k USD) in 18 months? I'm determined to do anything to make this 14 million HUF to buy a Tesla before the summer of 2023.I have a job at Oracle which lets me save 350k HUF (1115 USD) a month at least. I live with my parents and I don't have to pay anything to live here, I'm 20 years old. I asked them and they are fine with my plan.I have some old clothes to sell and some video games.I have an IT paper from my high school and I'm fluent in English and native in Hungarian.I also own a 2007 Suzuki Swift.

My payout varies by holiday workdays and the amount of weekend I get to work a certain month.It's safe to say that my payout ranges from 380k-420k based on the month.My question is that given all this data (I'm not sure it helps), what's the best way for me to be able to make this much amount of money to buy a Tesla in 18 months?

"Getting discord to delete my data My discord account got hacked, discord refused to recover it (their idea of recovery is basically just if you forget your password. Once the email gets changed, they say they 'can't do anything about it').

I have my real documents tied to that account (I was a verified developer, so my passport is connected to that account). I made multiple attempts over the last 2 months to get the data deleted, but they refused (or never replied at all, only got automated replies).

I'm in Czech Republic. My goal is to either gain access back to the account (it's a 5 year old account with a bot in few hundred servers), or get my personal data deleted from that account (because I believe that if the new 'owner' of the account did anything illegal, the first thing discord would do is report me to the authorities as I have my documents there).

" Being blacklisted by former employer. Any time frame until this is lifted? So I was with a company I enjoyed. After 4 years, I eventually left because I was relocating to a different part of the state.  It was my first job out of college and was located near my hometown.A week before giving my 2 week notice, I transfered some personal files from my work computer onto my personal hard drive (digital birth certificate, tax info, etc).  In doing this, I accidentally copied over 20,000+ documents related to work. After this was brought to my attention, I immediately (and voluntarily) handed over my personal hard drive to show I didn't mean anything by it.Long story short, I was essentially terminated 1 week into my 2 week notice by HR and a member of the IT security team ( both located in two different states). After looking at both individuals backgrounds, they had only been with the company for about 6 months before they stumbled onto ""my case"". I feel as if they tried to prove their worth to the company by trying to gaslight me into saying I knowingly took confidential documents (which were work related but not business essential - even though they said they were) and use them against the company.After being removed from the company for 18 months I reached out to HR to see if there is any chance for employment with the company in the future. They said it was highly unlikely.So I want to know if there is a blacklist the company would keep. And if so, is there a way to get off it? If the head of HR leaves and so does the IT security lead, can I explain my case to a new set of individuals? I only ask because I really enjoyed the work and the company. I left with the plan of coming back in a few years after trying out other types of industry related jobs (agriculture based). I worked really hard for the 4 years I was there to make a name for myself and to try and move up the ladder. Even so much so that I would have conversations with the Head of our North America division. I just have the feeling my name was dragged through the mud by two people that don't know me and have no idea what they were talking about with these ""confidential"" documents.Any info from HR individuals would be very much welcome.Edit: the transferred files were all done within minutes so it must have been a drag and drop situation of a folder that contained sub folders and so on. Also, the comments really opened my eyes to how serious an outsider takes this without any detailed context - similar to the individuals in my story. I must've been incredibly naive to the functions of large companies",0

"Can my pay be discussed behind my back? A coworker was ranting to me recently about how she is not getting enough hours/pay. During this conversation she was talking about the largest paycheck she has received during her employment and made a comment about how the individual in charge of payroll told her that she had made more than me during that particular pay period. This was because I took a vacation to visit family and we do not receive PTO (it's a small business).This comment was made in front of 2 coworkers, both of which I am the superior of. Honestly, this was the cherry on top of a large mountain of shit that I am sick of putting up with and drove me to finally write my overdue letter of resignation.I intend to bring this situation up to my boss during the conversation of me resigning, but I was curious to know if any laws were broken? I know that it is not illegal for me to discuss my pay with coworkers, but is it illegal for my pay to be discussed with my coworkers without my approval? Or is it illegal for the individual in charge or payroll to make these types of comments?Thanks for any insight you can provide!",1

I personally did not receive it, but it was sent to multiple group chats in my field (site locations basically). Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. The follow are word for word of what was messaged with names erased.""Salary Adjustments For those who know me well, know that I’m well guarded with what I say… I rarely speak out in anger or frustration… so before I start I’m going to apologize to the majority of you Before i start, 20+ years ago I got “into it” with some docs and I almost wanted to quit… instead I decided to come back with a smile… and I told myself that the day someone at work can take the smile away from me would be the day I walk away… 5 times in my career at _____ I’ve raised my voice to yell … this time I’m too exhausted… and I realize that I’m Not Angry.. I Am Frustrated I Am Disappointed and I’m more more disappointed than frustrated! I don’t understand this need to discuss your salary with your co-workers! The ______ tells us that we are Not to discuss our salaries!! I’ve asked several times to NOT discuss your salaries. I’ve been management for 18+ years and NOT once all in those years have I found someone getting more money because they talked amongst themselves. The Only Thing That Happens When You Decide To Talk Is That Someone Will Be Unhappy!!! I spoke to a Manager (not even one of us) and asked him… “If I told you that you were getting at least a $3000 raise today to do the exact same job as yesterday how would you feel?” He said very happy. Then I asked him, “if you found out that your peer got $4k, how would you feel?” He said he would be happy for the other person. But he could see some people feeling unhappy because they might feel less happy or appreciated. So then I said, “so if that other person got $3 or $2999 then it would be ok?” “So they would be happy if I could take money away from the other person?!?” When _____ got promoted to Director (same title as mine) I had hoped they give him more money than I made. When ______ got promoted to Director and he asked me what should he negotiate for? I told him a dollar amount higher than I make. I don’t know how much either are making… but if they got more than me or one day make more than me, I’d be Super Happy for them. This was Not a merit increase. This was not a cost of living increase. This was a market adjustment based on years of experience in your current modality… Plain… And… Simple Every tech got an increase… the increases were smaller for people who have been in the field longer and make more money.. that’s what the market surveyed show. The last 3 job market adjustments only increased the starting salary… this one everyone got something. The proper answer if someone ask you your salary is, “I don’t feel comfortable talking about that”. If you wanted be a little more street the answer would be, “none of your business!” In 20+ years, never thought that it would be “my” own techs that have come the closet to taking the smile off my face. So I’m Done. I’ve officially given up on asking you all to NOT speak about your salaries. I now understand that I can’t control that. What I can control is future promotions. Going forward, if I hear of anyone discussing their salaries, they will have to wait until after I retire and hope _____ is more forgiving than I will be. I am still looking at the salaries. I’m still trying to understand the steps. When I have all the answers I will share them. If I see that anyone is not getting what they should I will fight to correct It. And I plan to put this salary adjustment in the rear view mirror. God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I can not change The courage to change the things I can And the wisdom to know the difference P.S. for those of you that were truly happy for your increase and did not speak about your salary, I apologize for subjecting you to this long long message.

" Approaching to topic of feeling unwelcome at work and inappropriate work conversation I started a new job three months ago. Love the job itself-it’s a role I’m very knowledgeable and passionate about. I would like to not quit especially because I haven’t been here long. However, the colleague interactions here have been wildly out of pocket.I have felt extremely unwelcome since the week I started. I have a coworker who will look me in my face while I speak to her, then turn her back to me and not respond. I have a coworker who compares me to another, telling me she’s done this and that better and I need to be more like her. I have been treated like an outcast by my own direct manager who will literally hear me say something and act uncomfortable, then when my coworker says the same thing act very interested and passionate about the topic. I’ve gotten punished for doing the same exact thing my coworkers do while they’re reassured they can do it. I got written up for late attendance following an approved late day for taking my cat to the emergency vet.Past that, my manager and two of my coworkers have ACTIVELY spoken about inappropriate topics at work. My third week here they sat and spoke about kinky sex they’ve had with their dates, and toys involved. My manager will talk poorly about women he’s dated. They talk about getting wasted together and openly talk about parties that ONLY I am not invited to, right in front of me. It is so uncomfortable.I have numbers nearly the highest within the branch and my manager will say I’m not doing enough or working hard enough. I’ve gone to the bathroom on breaks to cry about the responses I receive when I’m literally just talking about normal stuff. I feel so isolated and uncomfortable but I can’t tell if I’m the problem.I have a direct ops manager (the unprofessional one), a branch manager (who hasn’t been problematic), a sales manager above them and then a manager above everybody else within the branch (the latter two whom I never interact with). Our HR is entirely remote. Is this a situation that would require speaking to a higher up? If so, who do I go to first?

" An old boss of mine slapped my gf's butt recently and uses slurs in front of employees and his business partner does nothing. I worked at this place for 3 years before I quit because of stuff like this and that was about 3 years ago now. So in some capacity or another, for the last 6 years, I have been personally experiencing as well as hearing about this pile for too long. Whether it's my girlfriend (who is African-American, this will be important), myself, my friends I'm tired of hearing about this guy continuing this.To the point.He does this ""good game"" thing where he slaps your butt and says, ""good game"" like you would in baseball. Red flag from the get go. In the time I worked there he'd do it to the male employees and no one really cared or at least said they did, nothing like this at least. Sadly, this happened to her the other week and of course when she tried saying something she was made to believe that it was her fault, that ""his generation was different"", all the same excuses these cowards make. He tried telling her as well that it was only the back of his hand anyways. This has been making me sick since it happened, barely really slept because I'm so angry at night and the one other co-onwer does nothing. The owner even told my gf not to say anything to me about what they talked about. Can't imagine why he wouldn't want this out.Besides testimonies of past and present employees and like so many other cases today, there's no true hard evidence and sadly this is a two-party state in regard to recording.He's used the N-word in front of employees, called myself and other employees ""re***ds"" when he's upset with them, as well as, ""I'm not saying it because he's black but..."". This was in regard to when an African-American customer couldn't make a payment for several months due to factors beyond the man's control. We couldn't get ahold of the guy or run the card that he gave us so naturally why not blurt out racist rhetoric to your employees when you get upset? Seems TOTALLY acceptable in the workplace. Another oldie but goodie that he loves is, ""I grew up with black friends so I can't be racist, I'm the least racist person I know.""When I first started there I even agreed to work overtime hours without overtime pay because I was struggling so much at the time and needed every penny I could get. It was dumb I know, but I've been since informed that it's illegal even if you agree to it. He would also tell employees not to discuss their wages with each other which is right protected by law. This clown has even told me that HE is the HR department. Judge, jury and executioner, how convenient for him.I promise these things are all true and not some exaggerations, this recent incident is one of many various things he does and it breaks my heart hearing my gf blaming herself for him touching her.

" Am I getting fired or is this a genuine opportunity to improve? I have been at this company for over a year now and am an employee, direct report to supervisor. For the first 10 months I was under a supervisor who no longer works for the company - he was very uninvolved with my career advancement and never checked in, but I could always sense that he wasn’t very fond of me. I now have a new supervisor, who I’ve been under for about 2 months now, and things were going good to me knowledge. I had meetings with my new supervisor and asked if my performance was good and she stated no problems. I even had a meeting with my manager (for separate reason) and asked if there are any ways to improve my performance and she said she was pleased with my performance.The following day after meeting with my manager, I got called in to a meeting with my supervisor, manager, and HR. They presented a written warning to me, stating some mistakes I’ve made while on the job (fair), but also several other minor issues that I was never aware were issues (like talking too much on bench, being on phone too much). They said that if these issues aren’t addressed within 30 days when we reevaluate and meet again, I could be fired. I was never aware that these issues were even a thing so I apologized and said I would be more mindful of these issues.Days later, my supervisor met with me again for a regular scheduled meeting and she apologized for the written warning meeting. She said that my manager was only involved because she is a newer supervisor and doesn’t know the process to written warnings. She also said that it was reassuring to see my surprised reaction to the stated problems because she said most of these issues were older and was just never addressed by my uninvolved, older supervisor and had to bring them up because they were documented. I expressed my willingness to change and do whatever for the company, and also expressed my fear of the company using this as a nice way to let me know I’m getting fired. She reassured me that it wasn’t the case.I need your help HR Reddit. I will go forward and do better on the complaints they listed, but I am curious how I should perceive the situation - I’m getting fired and they’re giving me a heads up, or this is genuinely a chance to do better of issues I wasn’t aware on.Also is there anything I can do during this period to protect myself and also do better performance wise?",0
" Company is made of 85% new employees Hi! I am joining a new team with 150 current employees (company is based in NY, but remote) The company is over 12 years now.

 Recruiter Miscommunication During my verbal offer I was told/have written down 20 days PTO after my first 90 days (which is what I got at my last job so I didn’t question it). I just started this week to find out I only have 10 vacation days.There was also miscommunication in a 5% yearly bonus (which was also miscommunicated to another new hire).It’s my first week and I feel lied to/slighted by the recruiter. The written job offer was kind of vague and gave the pay and the basic medical vision dental benefits.I would like to send an email to my HR rep addressing the vacation days miscommunication because I wouldn’t have taken the job had I known I’d only get 10 days… and I was hoping for some guidance on what to say and still be professional.

"Child's father wants Paternity test even though he hasn't been involved in child's life This guy wants a paternity test for a 1 year old. He isn't on the child's birth certificate, and he's not directly coming out as the child's father. The mother doesn't want him involved in the child's life since he did not want to take responsibility and didn't want to be on the child's birth certificate.

Rather they put a link to their website where it describes the fee.

" Recently laid off HR internship due to “budgeting implications.” Starting off, I just want to apologize if this is in the wrong subreddit. In the beginning of September I had started a new HR internship at a mid-sized tech firm only to find out less than two weeks in, the HR business partner calls me into office stating “I have to lay you off due to budgeting issues.” I had even asked her if there were any issues on my part personally that I did wrong and she stated no, it’s just budgeting. I find out two days ago, that the same internship is listed on Glassdoor again which made my heart sunk. I had emailed her today regarding the position again and asked if I was laid off due to other reasons and that if I was, I would profoundly appreciate any advice on how to improve. My preceding two internships were at law firms and the HR setting was completely new for me but I still feel extremely sad because I feel like an idiot. Are internship lay offs normal and is it normal to fail at an internship as long as you learn from it? Any advice would help me, and once again sorry if this is in the wrong sub.",0

"Pre-Check/Global Entry revoked because of THC gummies. Any chance I could appeal given the marijuana reforms just announced by Biden? I was singled out for a very intensive CBP search upon my return to San Francisco from a trip to Mexico two years ago. Agents found 3 THC gummies which they tested and confirmed on-site. I wasn't arrested or fined but my Trusted Traveler status (Global Entry & Pre-Check) was revoked almost immediately.Biden's announcement today indicates that he would pardon ""all prior Federal offenses of simple possession of marijuana."" There were no criminal proceedings/arrests/charges related to this situation. I'm curious if ""offenses"" might possibly include my foolish mistake, allowing me to appeal the Trusted Traveler revocation.It it matters, I'm a resident of California and the incident happened in California. California allows personal consumption of recreational marijuana and the amount I posssessed was far below CA's legal limit. I also was granted a medicinal use card in the past but it was expired at the time of this incident.I recognize that Biden's announcement is very new but I would appreciate any insight at this time. I would really like to get my Pre-Check status back! Thanks!",1
" explaining termination without cause and no supervisor reference I was recently terminated without cause, it was performance related regarding a rough patch from the last few months with the transition from manual to automated processes in a new system (other than the rough patch, led my peers in KPI's, was converted from a temporary to permanent employee,  positive yearly review, commodations from clients). Overall, was not a great fit and I certainly take responsibility but I also felt my supervisor didn't understand the challenges I faced in these months (no experience with my client group or its history, and least tech saavy person I've ever met)Anyways, Ive never been in this position before and have an interview coming up. From what I read from previous threads, its best to keep the details short (explain I was let go without cause and was not the best fit for me because of xyz responsibilitties, but this new position is a good fit because of abc responsibilities). I have supervisor references from my previous positions but how would I explain not having a supervisor reference from my most recent position if asked? Should I tell them upfront it wasn't the best fit with the supervisor when asked why I left? or hope they don't ask and explain if they do?While I'm sure the rough patch was the main factor, I think other factors were upcoming budget decreases that would result in less work and the new system being more self service.TIA",0
"How do you compare IRRs for 2 different compensation rates? Hello, I work in the solar industry and am having a little trouble wrapping my head around how to compare IRRs with different utility rate scenarios.Example: Customer has a rate of 5¢ per kWh. If they use solar, they would get that 5¢ credit per each kWh produced and pay for each kWh they buy from the grid. If the customer switched to a higher rate of 10¢ per kWh, they would be credited 10¢ per kWh produced and charged 10¢ per kWh they buy. Essentially for this switch to make sense, they would have to have enough solar to make the difference of the higher rate worth it.Now comes the IRR question. When I model the 5¢ rate option, the IRR is 6.3%. When I model the 10¢ option, I get a 13.5% IRR (rough numbers here). How do I compare these to understand which is truly the better option?Thanks for your help!",2

" Paid Time Off Request Notice On Monday last week, I informed my manager that I would take a day off for the following week (I did not tell them the reason why, which is this brief following explanation) since I can see ahead that I’m pushing myself too hard if I work 5 days a week after a 3-day work trip (from Wed to Fri) connecting to a 2-day weekend traveling (Sat & flying back Sunday). I told them it would probably be Friday or another day later in the week since I want to wrap up a few things in the beginning of the week after a long work trip before taking a day off, but I was not sure which day later in the week yet and will let them know (I did not specify when I would let them know either). They talked about how I should take Monday off since they always takes the day after a work trip off and that I should take Monday off instead of Friday and thanked me for letting her know ahead of time since she would normally just take off whichever day she wanted without notice. I felt a bit uneasy since now my choice is narrowed down to just either Monday or Friday? Fast forward to when the work week is over, (fyi the manager was on the same work trip with me, but they flew back on Friday while I stayed in the area for the weekend.) On Monday morning, they messaged me asking if I was taking the day off. I said no and mentioned I would take Wednesday off instead since it works better for my schedule. They mentioned that they knew that it was a different circumstance, but they needed more than a week’s notice on what specific day. They wasn’t sure if I was working today or not. I then responded in the heat of the moment “Since this is only a day off, I think giving you a 2-3 business day notice is sufficient. They then said that they were communicating with me what they needed from me and to please comply with this. They would be happy to make exceptions if necessary, but it was helpful for them to have time to plan a week ahead. They also added that some companies would ask for months in advance and left it as that.I work in an ad agency in social media where I have my own group of small clients. I’m not in any meetings with client, and we’re at a time where we don’t have any pressing items to be done. The policy and expectations for giving pto requests were not stated when I onboarded, so I stuck to my rule of thumb to give them as much notice as I could or twice/tripple the amount of time I’m taking off. In my case, I believe I gave them enough notice in advance.My question is: was I behaving unprofessionally? How should I have approached this situation or the Monday conversation and what should I do moving forward? I plan to ask them to give me a specific guide of how much notice they expect me to give for PTO down to the amount of days (ex: 1 day = 1 week’s notice, 2-3 days = ..., etc.).

I asked an employee who was recently hired by the same agency and she told me they immediately sent her the I-9 through email and got on board. So I kinda jumped to the conclusion that the manager has been lying to me.I feel like I've wasted a lot of time, is there anything I could do? Like possible get employment with the same company but at another venue? It feels like they prefer using a temp employee 3 days a week vs. full time and not having to pay union or health insurance, etc. It also seems the manager tried to offer to other temps to work there, like why would she do that?",0
"Hypothetically could businesses get around laws that only apply past a certain number of employees or gain tax benefits that are supposed to only go to smaller businesses by legally restructuring into a bunch of separate businesses bound to provide certain ""services"" to each other by contract? I would not do this, and please don't try this at home (or at your business). This is obviously unethical. But what if any measures are there to prevent this sort of a loophole?For instance suppose a restaurant wants more staff but they don't want to have to offer a health plan. The boss, instead of hiring more staff pitches an idea to his brother. His brother draws up the papers and starts his own 'business' which provides the service of providing restaurants with additional help from its own employees. His brother's business signs some kind of a contract with the restaurant effectively promising that his employees will spend most or all of their time providing that service to that restaurant. The employees legally have his brother as his boss, but the contract says his brother is to give orders to his employees to take orders from the restaurant owner, and that the contract is void with a large financial penalty if the brother violates that.Now each business has less than the statutory minimum of employees for requiring a health plan on paper but in practice the same work is done that would've been done had the restaurant just hired all of them directly.Obviously this could extend beyond just two 'small businesses' (on paper). You could hypothetically have 100s of 'small businesses' that have a web of contracts with each other to result in the same day to day actions as they would if it were just one business.Has this ever been tried and what is there in law (statutory, administrative, or case law) to close that loophole?",1
" Company with <50 FTE. 1099 contractor taking time off to have a baby. Temp 1099 contractor hired to cover leave. Moral/legal dilemma. The person hired as a temp drastically outperforms this contractor - in terms of quality of work product, professionally supporting other employees, and general energy/ dedication to do their best work. This has also demonstrably affected everyone else’s work day in positive ways.NJ is an at-will state. The contract for the original 1099 employee and the current temp is for an hourly rate for hours performed.Not continuing with the original contractor and retaining the temp would objectively be best for the company.Legally- can the temp be retained and the relationship with the original contractor be terminated without negative consequences to the company?Morally- I feel like shit.Can anyone give the down and dirty on this situation? I’m agonizing over this.ETA: Thank you for your input. I will check with counsel to determine if there is any risk to termination of the contract.Follow up question.

"Regarding ""best by"" date codes on non-perishable food (PA-US & ONTARIO) I work at a production plant that manufactures and packages dry Kosher cereals such as oatmeal, grits, and cream of wheat.While based in Pennsylvania, we utilize a co-packer based out of Ontario for products we don't have the means to produce on-site, such as single-serve packets. Our co-packer generally takes about 2 weeks of production to satisfy our orders.What this means for us is that we get a truckload of product with sometimes up to 10 different date codes, not in any type of coherent order, and either partial pallets of each datecode, or mixed pallets with 2 (rarely more) datecodes. This bogs down the shipping and receiving dock as we have to verify the datecodes and the quantity of each datecode. This also chokes up the warehouse as we sort and ship everything by FIFO.It would be much simpler, with less chances of someone screwing something up, if the products came to us with, say, the oldest production date as the datecode for the whole shipment.Is there any law or regulations that forbid us from marking the expiration date as all one day, where it expires up to a month sooner than normal for those products?",1

E.g., if my client told me he took the candy bar, I can not allow him to testify and say ""I never took the candy bar!"" I also can not argue that he never took it.""I've heard there is a difference between American and British legal perspective on this, the above sounds like what I've heard about British Law, would be interesting to know the poster's nationality.  I'm assuming American law.I've read comments somewhat like this is the past, but not this blunt, so it made me question some of my assumptions and I'd like some clarification.  My questions are purely academic out of my own curiosity:From watching ""Don't Talk to the Police"" on Youtube I already know that your attorney should do all your speaking for you.  My understanding of this is, even if you are innocent and want to say ""I am innocent, I would never do such a terrible crime!"", you do not say it, you have your attorney say ""My client is innocent, and would never do such a terrible crime.""  And I would have assumed that even if you graphically confessed a murder or rape to your attorney, they are still supposed to say on your behalf, ""My client is innocent.""Am I completely wrong on this, as far as American law goes (also interested to hear the British view)?As an example, let's assume that John committed a serious crime like rape or murder but did so carefully enough that there is a decent chance he might avoid prosecution much less conviction if he keeps his mouth shut and his lawyer plays the cards right.  On one hand John wants his attorney to believe he is innocent so he will be more passionate in his defense.  On the other, John thinks the attorney should know exactly what happened in detail so that the attorney can come up with exculpatory possibilities to argue on John's behalf, or to know how close the prosecution is getting to the truth.Like, I'm trying to imagine John telling his attorney he is innocent as a newborn baby, but then telling his attorney ""well what if I was here doing this or there doing that"" and asking the attorney to raise those possibilities to the D.A. but in attorney speak like ""what if my client was here when that happened"", so as to make the D.A. think the case against him is too weak and drop the charges.So which is it, does John want to tell his attorney that he is completely innocent, or does John want to be honest in detail?  What options might become not available with each course of action?",1

"Walmart radiator burst and damaged hundreds of bucks worth of stuff. Walmart is not responsive. What can I do I bought a $45 radiator from Walmart online about 3 months ago.

"Advice on handling a coworker that does not play well with others at a tech startup in  I work at a small start-up with ~20 full-time employees, and for the most part, I love my job and the people I work with.There is one coworker, whom I will call Josh, that routinely gets in conflict with everyone else. Josh is a 21y guy that has no problem stepping on anyone to get what he wants and never faces any repercussions because his father is the VC of the company. His father is also the ""HR"" person at the company so complaints to HR regarding his behavior are futile. Josh doesn't follow standard company procedures and doesn't think any of the rules apply to him. To be fair, he is right because he doesn't follow the rules and nothing ever happens to him.I regularly have to apologize to our clients for his behavior and mistakes (I am in a client-facing role, but Josh is not) and there is 0 intervention from management.This is an example of how I have been approaching the situation and what I said to my manager recently regarding this coworker-""Sometimes Josh says things to me that I feel are combative and disrespectful or that make it seem as if I don't know how to do my job. I often feel bullied by him to do things that are not in the best interest of the company - (specific examples of his behavior ) or make exceptions to standard company procedures.

"Hiring one person temp and another straight on and tipping temp employees-TN I have 2 questions for you (I live in Nashvilles). So last year for the third holiday season, I went back to my old job at a Factory as a  shipping clerk. The job has alot of downtime  so I would also work the counter greeting customers give them the cookies and so on and so forth. The past 3 years, my boss has always promised me she would give me a full time job since they liked my work ethic and was great with customers but every time there was always some excuse as to why it fell through.  (Last time it was that the two my boss chose were mothers and more needed the work) After the last holiday season, Id heard that one person they hired was being fired so I came in and asked for the job. Since I've worked there now three years, they knew me, and I know the temporary agency gets a cut up my money, I asked if I could just be hired on full-time since I'd proven 3xs over I could do the job . I was specifically told HR that they were NOT ALLOWED to hire anyone outside of the agency because of some contracts. After working there for two months a girl comes in, gives me her resume, tell her about the agency rule but take her resume and give it to my boss. Then bam they hire her on no agency ! I think, that's really strange because they don't know this person yet they know me and know I'm good for the work that they specifically said they were not allowed to fire so questionAre you allowed to hire employees under different circumstances like that?Like, to tell an employee that they already know it's good for the work no I have to do another three or four months of temp work before they could decide to take me and it would also exclude me from benefits and other perks (like tips - big issue) for a few months.  But then let another person be hired normally. They were only about 3 or 4 weeks between the ending of my last contract before I came back for this last one and asked if I was still in the window where I could be hired from the last contract but HR said noMy second question is, are they allowed to keep tips from you if you are temporary worker when you're interacting with the customers and that's what most people tip? We were told that we were paid extra to make up the difference (which was 1 to 2 dollars max) but it seems completely unfair for us to have to take customer tips and have them thrown into a pool that me and my other co-worker weren't allowed to get from?  On my last week where my coworker did receive the tips it was about $350 ('gourmet cookies' $27 a dozen so tips add up with 3 people working the counter). Is that legal at all? HR told us that we were not allowed to get them because we would have to declare them and they'd be taxed and the agency forbade it (and that we were paid more than the full time workers) to which I said that makes no sense. I'd rather be taxed and get something as opposed to nothing.  I called the the agency and asked if the no decision was actually true and they said that that was not true, that we could be paid in tips but we would have to just declare them.  My co-worker and I ran the counter so we were actually interacting with customers and getting the tip money and everything while my boss was in the back taking all day to do paperwork  and on her phone-added blah blah -My time ended under bad circumstances when my boss, who's straight up did not like me, lied and made up some things about me being late  (car was stranded for 2 says working with AAA-gave a call I MIGHT be late but was on time and being labeled insubordinate for listening to the warehouse manager telling me I could not be in a certain area while he was moving pallets, and her going ballistic for using a small towel as a sweat rag (from having to run around the warehouse restocking and getting things she would never handle) and I feel honestly  like I was treated differently there than the others . I am a black gay guy, and the entirety of the staff there is all white women.  My boss had the final say and they couldn't even give me one reason why they were letting me go other than what she said, no investigation no listening to my side of the story . We didn't get along and it was her decision. She stated that, I was hired more to do the manly things like move the boxes, which also found a bit insulting considering I taught her how to do her job and did her job better than her and work two jobs the past 3 years I was thereso my questions areTldrCan you tell when employees are not allowed to hire directly but then turn around and hired directly just a few weeks after giving them certain perks like benefits and tips?

"Consequences to having ethics  Hey there, AskHR. Long-time listener, first-time caller (as it were). I have sort of an ethical dilemma I'm faced with. I'm a newly minted leader at my company and we recently hired a new CXO who I report to, directly. About a month ago, I was at dinner with said CXO and our entire department (which I lead). We were celebrating a few recent new-hires and having dinner at a crowded restaurant. An important note, I'm wearing a company shirt at this dinner so we are easily identifiable.While we waited for our food to arrive, this CXO suddenly and apropos of nothing in the conversation, drops the N-word. My jaw dropped as I nervously looked around. He then proceeds to explain how he would never say the   in an offensive way to anyone - he's not a racist. But if he were playing some really competitive basketball, might call someone the   in the spirit of competitiveness.I quickly changed the subject and we moved on. The next day, I set up a call with my boss and called out his behavior the previous day, professionally, explaining that not only did it offend employees, but me, and probably other patrons, and because I was wearing the company polo! He apologized and said it would never happen again.Since then he has made a few other comments, for example using the R-word in reference to a current team member (behind closed doors).

" told not to speak Spanish at work There is quite a long back story as to why I was told not to speak English by my supervisor. Firstly, the topic came across because my supervisor was already mentioning how she hates working at another site where the majority of the population speaks Arabic. She ended the conversation with “-oh and by the way you and   can’t speak Spanish at your desks around other employees.” I was immediately taken aback and her opinion on employees speaking in another language was already making me feel uncomfortable. I didn’t argue and just left but felt that what she said was not okay.Recently, an issue occurred between coworkers (that has nothing to do with me) and started when someone said something in Spanish and was asked to say it in English. It was very obvious the Spanish speaker was commenting on the other coworker, and the Spanish speaker did translate it to English. An argument came out of it, though I’m sure was never officially reported. Now, the non-Spanish speaking coworker is very close friends with my supervisor. Hence, my supervisor telling me not to speak Spanish. I’m sure the non-Spanish speaking coworker was also never reprimanded for a little stunt she pulled off after work (confronted the Spanish speaking coworker and yelled at her, was close to initiating a fight).I can see my coworkers argument being her excuse that she is only trying to make the environment comfortable for everyone, however I don’t think that was the correct way to go about it by prohibiting the use of a language while I’m sitting at my desk and conversing with other coworkers. Especially when half the workers speak Spanish and she made me feel uncomfortable stating how she felt about employees who don’t speak English at work.Seeing she’s only a supervisor to a large company, is she allowed to tell me not to speak Spanish?",0

" Requesting Accommodations for Mental Health/Learning Disabilities Hi everyone-Just looking for some guidance or feedback here. I'm based in PA but my employer is based in CA and has employees and offices in several different states and countries.I work remotely, in online support, and handle a variety of email, social, and chat support inquiries. When I trained for this position a year and a half ago, the company I work for was not offering any phone support channels and did not indicate they had any plans of implementing this in the future. Fast forward to 2022: earlier this year, my employer announced they would be implementing phone support but would start on a very limited basis with only select departments. They saw success with this, and recently, it was announced that they would be moving forward in making this a mandatory requirement for everyone in my role.If this was a part of the job when I first started, I would not have even applied. I have ADHD and have struggled with anxiety and depression for several years. These were only heightened during the pandemic - I deal with a lot of social anxiety now and struggle to keep up in conversation. This often results in momentary memory lapse, brain fog, and physical stuttering when engaging in ongoing verbal communication. I’ve never wanted to work in phone support, but right now, I’m perhaps more ill-equipped to do this than I ever would have been prior to 2020. I acknowledge that this is detrimental and would like to work to improve this over time, but it’s not something that can be done abruptly without increasing my stress tenfold, and I have several other responsibilities outside of work that will suffer if my job causes me to panic every day. Overall, I really like the company I work for and it would be really difficult for me to switch employers at the moment, but the anticipation of this on top of several other changes has left me completely burnt out, anxious, and dreading work every day.In a recent meeting, my supervisor also noticed that this seemed to be causing me an abnormal amount of stress/anxiety and recommended I reach out to our HR team to inquire about potential accommodations, which was an option I’d never considered.HR informed me that in order to be eligible for accommodations I would need to have a Medical Certification Form completed by a physician or healthcare provider, and I’m honestly at a loss trying to figure out the best way to obtain this.My questions are these:1.) Due to some financial limitations, I’m not currently in therapy. I do have a general physician, but they can hardly even consistently get my medication prescriptions correct so I’m reluctant to go to them for anything (I’ve been meaning to look for a new doctor, but truly just haven’t had the time). Would this be something my general physician would be able to write for me, or should I try and contact my last therapist (our last session was probably halfway through 2021).2.) I know some job applications require you to disclose whether or not you are “disabled” and in need of accommodation, which I usually decline because obviously, I don’t want that to impact my hireability. If I receive accommodation at this job, will I be required to disclose this to potential future employers as well?3.) Is this request reasonable? Imposter syndrome is absolutely at play here… I don’t feel like I can prove that these obstacles are enough to warrant accommodation, but simultaneously most days I truly believe I’d rather quit than go through with this. If I do, I’ll be taking a big hit on my mental health which is the last thing I need right now. But if I decide to leave, I’ll likely be taking a big hit on my financial situation instead.",0
"Resigning with Negative PTO  First time posting, please let me know if anything goes against rules.I am resigning from my salaried position with a CA company in Los Angeles.I have been working this position for 6 months and have not received any employee handbook other than a procedures guide for the actual work we're doing. No employee guidance really. I have asked for a handbook and been told that they are working on updating it. That was over a month ago. I asked again this week and specified that I was asking because I needed ""any document I can refer to at this time to better understand how to proceed with certain procedures and actions as an employee"" and was given a response of ""We will take care of this next week after the deadline.""If I didn't formally request the PTO, and it was confirmed that I never received any company policy on employee PTO, can they deduct the negative PTO from my final paycheck?My main reason for asking is because I have negative PTO from July when I was exposed to covid on my last day of vacation and had to extend my time off from work. I did not formally request PTO for the extended time out of office, but I received it anyway leading me to severe negative PTO (-66 hours then but worked down to -54 hours now).6 weeks later I had a meeting with HR and the president confirming that I did not have PTO policy given to me and I was not aware I was even receiving it until after it was too late. They confirmed that they had not explained it to me and I did not have any employee handbook other than a procedures guide for the actual work we're doing. That was in late August. Still no documents now.I would like to resign and have my last day be this upcoming Tuesday. Due to lack of handbook/guidance on resignation, how should I proceed?",0
" If someone moves a lot in their sleep and hurts/damages someone else, can they be sued? Purely hypothetical, this hasn't happened to me or anyone I know. But yeah, if someone moves around a lot in their sleep, say with a lot of arm or leg movements, and while sleeping next to someone they unconsciously hit or kick them or something in a way that causes actual harm - for example, say they get punched in the eye, or something moves in such a way as that it snaps a finger, or something like that - can the person be sued for something like assault?I know details matter for this, so let me flesh out this hypothetical a bit more: let's assume that the two are recently dating and sleeping in the same bed for the first time; Person X (the victim) agrees to sleep next to Person Y (the sleep attacker), and was told that Person Y moves around a lot in their sleep, but was given no indication that it might put Person X in harm's way - after all, plenty of people sleep together, but who warns their sleeping partner that sleeping together would be legitimately dangerous?

" using PTO during office closures Hi everyone! With the holidays coming up, the company I work for will be closed from Christmas to New Year's day.

"Employer Horror Story Hello,My name is  . For the past two months I have been an employee of   in  , Michigan. I work as a cook and live in employee housing provided by the owner of the restaurant I work at.
When I arrived here in May, the house was in a state of filth. There is black mold and exposed wiring. There is an employee housing unit across from mine which is not legally habitable because the bedrooms are less than 7 feet across. I recently put in my two-weeks notice to quit because of poor working conditions. Shortly thereafter, I discovered a serious error in my reported hours and pay. I brought this to my manager, who discovered bookkeeping discrepancies that amount to over one thousand dollars of pay that I earned but did not receive. My manager provided documentation for this. After learning this, I used our work messaging app to contact the owner and asked him to meet with me personally so that we could talk about getting my pay corrected. The owner refused to schedule the meeting. I told the owner that a third party was going to audit my wage report, and he responded by terminating my employment. I told the owner that this is wrongful, and he responded by telling me that I have three days to vacate the housing. I don’t have anywhere to go. I told the owner that he needed to serve me an order to evict. I did this in hopes that it would buy me enough time to find a place to stay, because I don’t want to become homeless out here. Shortly after, the owner and his wife appeared at the employee housing. The owner told me I had to leave immediately and threatened me with physical violence. The owner told me that he was going to grab me by my neck and throw me out. His wife was the only other person in the room. After the owner made this threat, I put my phone on record and asked him to apologize for threatening me. The owner repeatedly said “I don’t know what you’re talking about”, and his wife also refused to acknowledge the threat. The owner then called the sheriff, left the house, and stood guard outside in a posse with his wife and two other men, both of whom work for him. I do not know what he told the police. When I went outside, I believe they were audio recording me. The owner said loudly that he was forcing me to vacate because he felt threatened and one of his men began telling me that I had appeared unstable for weeks at work. This is not true and my co-workers will attest to it. This man also said a number of things to insinuate that I was using illegal drugs. I do not use illegal drugs or drink alcohol and will readily submit to drug and alcohol screening in order to prove it. The owner repeatedly told me that I was going to spend the night in jail. I don’t know why I would go to jail because I wasn’t breaking any laws, but this threat made me fear that I had been falsely accused of a crime. I don’t know what he told the police on the phone. I reasonably suspect that they are colluding to fabricate a false narrative about me in order to delegitimize my claims if I pursue legal recourse. I packed my things quickly, left before the police arrived, and got myself a hotel room. Since the owner responded this way, I have no idea how I will ever recover the money that I am owed.What are my options?",1

But the one time I didn't show up I had a valid reason since I was in the hospital. I even had a doctor's note but he said it was unacceptable. He said if I didn't show up this weekend I would get a letter. A letter at this place means if you get three of them you get terminated. But the thing, is those who don't show up don't get reprimanded in any way, he never even brings it up. I'm from Indiana and this is at a shipping company. Ever since a certain instant happened people keep quitting like wildfire. That and the way they treat us is just awful so nobody wants to stay. They might pay us well but the treatment is bad.

" Advice about HR response about confrontation with manager For some background, I work in a hotel doing room service and we are implementing a lot of changes. We used to use carts to deliver food orders, equipped with a hot box for hot entrées, however we just changed executive directors and they want to remove the hit boxes completely. That works for small, single orders however sometimes I get hit with upwards of a half dozen orders all at once and taking my cart to deliver several at a time is much quicker and easier, especially if orders are in rooms on the same floor or right next to each other.So yesterday, I received four orders in the span of ten minutes or so, three of which were right door next to each other so I decided taking my cart would make far more sense than running back and forth four times(for perspective it’s about a quarter mile from kitchen to rooms each way, it’s not a tiny property per se). As I’m getting drinks at the bar, I asked the bartender to grab a couple for me if she had time, one of which being a Diet Coke. All of a sudden, my manager comes storming behind the bar with the glass of Diet Coke saying how that particular glassware isn’t being used anymore since it’s too top heavy for tray use(this is true, I’ve spilled so many drinks using that glass it’s insane). As she’s getting ready to pour a whole new one, I try explaining that since I’m taking so many orders at once, I’m using my cart and that it will be fine in that glass since it’ll be wrapped anyways, no need to use up another glass. She then flips a switch and just goes off on me saying how we aren’t using carts anymore, I need to do as I’m told, just a slew of things in the most condescending and rude way possible. It’s important to also note that while she is loudly berating and yelling at me, there is a hotel guest sitting at the bar top waiting for her breakfast order.Once my manager finishes yelling at me and storms off, the guest goes “she sounds fun.”  I explain that that’s just how things are and is what it is, but the guest is incredibly sympathetic and apologetic at how I was treated and remarks “no one should talk to anyone like that ever.” She also mentions how she will be bringing it up to someone.Since a guest was technically involved, I emailed various members of management to let them know of the situation and to protect myself with a paper trail of it all, HR included. However this morning I received a response from HR that left me feeling a little defeated and frustrated. They let me know she was in the wrong for her actions in front of the guest, but basically told me that if I just didn’t “talk back”, none of this would have happened. It makes me feel the blame is being pushed on to me, and that management isn’t responsible for any of it.Am I wrong for feeling that way? Was I in the wrong? I feel like this is a case of victim blaming, but maybe it’s not? Just not sure where to go from here and I’m hoping this is a good sub to ask for advice on how to move forward.I also want to note that this manager and I don’t get along very well, however it’s been made clear by other staff members that she explicitly treats me differently and singles me out for issues/bullying. This is not an isolated incident.",0

"What do therapist have to report? Hi, I live in Kansas, and I was hoping to get some clarification about some legal rules about what therapist are supposed to report. My dad was in a car accident when I was about 7 and it changed his behavior for a amount of years. During those years he physically abused me and my siblings. I want to talk to a therapist about it but I am worried that they would have to report it. I don’t want to report it because I have a little sister who is 10. He has never physically abused her because he is alum a better state of mind. So I guess my question is if someone committed abuse while suffering from a mental condition but they have since recovered will they still be considered a danger to others?",1
" My new manager keeps trying to undermine me and downplay my success. What are my options? Been at my current job for 2 years and for the first 1.5 years, I had a great manager who really uplifted me and helped me grow. He nudged me to take risks while having my back and I was able to succeed and grow my own team of two direct reports. I built a reputation as a strong performer, was given multiple recognition awards, and a promotion. I also developed a reputation across organizations and have led many company-wide events. Basically a lot of people know me, like me, and respect me even though I’m just a middle manager. Leadership told me that they see a bright future for me at the company.My manager left 6 months ago for something else and his replacement was a distant, but internal transfer. I was not asked to interview him and most people suspect that he was a budget hire (we don’t pay as much as the rest of our industry).The new manager IMMEDIATELY struck me as a problem because he made bold and unsubstantiated claims of what he did in the other department. Furthermore, he had little interest in what I worked on or what my strategies were for our team and claimed to have all the answers. I made many attempts explain how he was misaligned with what we do and what our actual problems are, but it was futile. He had his one speech and his buzzwords and just kept repeating them in meetings. I realized that we couldn’t really work together, so just kept doing my thing and ignored him.He met with many teams and and orgs quickly developed a bad reputation among them. Everyone could see that he was just a smooth talker who claimed to be a visionary. Maybe he really believes that he is, but few others else do.So I kept doing my thing and ignoring him, but then he found out how powerful my reputation and brand are. Instead of continuing to uplift me and partner with me, he chose to hire a new manager in between us. This manager was his former colleague and seemed to believe in him.Now, both of them are starting to push me out of the picture and utilizing their authority to do so. They are replacing me in important meetings and downplaying my achievements by promising that they can do it better. They proposed a big shakeup to our org behind both mine and my colleagues backs. They have secret meetings with my partner teams and claim that they’re the new points of contact going forward. I find out about all of these shadow meetings from the other attendees who are confused and telling me that they prefer to work with me instead.I raised this to some leadership, but they brushed it off and told us to figure it out ourselves. They are happy with the work that is getting done (mostly by me) and don’t want to help with conflict resolution.I’m sure that my new and toxic managers have their own side to of all of this, but I believe that they are feeling threatened by my success and insecure about their lack of capability. They probably can’t get me fired because of my broader reputation and so are using their authority to slowly sideline me. They literally use terms like “we’re resetting the partnerships.”Since leadership won’t help, would going to HR help? I can show documentation of how they misrepresented facts, hid decks that called out teams for things they didn’t do, and withheld important info from me and others. But could they retaliate by saying I’ve been insubordinate by not blindly following their new “way of working”?It’s been really stressful and the job market is not so great right now… I’m almost to the point of sucking it up, but I don’t want to give up… was leadership not telling me something about me and chose to knowingly go in a new direction? I’m so lost now…",0
" Management asking me to do double the work for a different job title that I was led to believe I already had, but never did. Hello - I'll try to summarize my story as much as I can, but it may still be a little lengthy. (sorry)I've worked for a small company for over 7 years, and we were acquired about 2 years ago. A little over year ago, two employees left our company and therefore me and another person were asked by the acquiring company if we could take over the roles - which is a different job title (Marketing to Project Management). I agreed thinking my title would change and perhaps even a pay adjustment would eventually follow. (My fault for assuming)About 4 months ago, the acquiring company began ""restructuring"". The other guy and I were told that since we're now project managing, we would now be reporting to a new manager from the acquiring company. Obviously, my original boss from the original company wasn't too happy about his team being taken away. In the end, the ""change"" happened, and we've been reporting to the new manager.About 3 weeks ago, lay-offs happened and the person that had their ""role changed"" with me was also let go. I came to find out from my old boss that HR had asked him to let go of the other person. He told HR that he wasn't our manager, and that their ""new manager"" should be the one doing the lay-off.After discussing with my old boss, he followed-up on why he was still being considered as the manager for myself and the other person. Upper management told him that it was the best way to go about it without making a mess with ""cross company "" resources and management.I asked my new manager about my title, and he played the ""I didn't know your title didn't change"" role. Yet he was making the argument to upper management that myself and this other person should be under his management 4 months ago.As you can imagine, I'm not very happy that not only I didn't get a title change, I didn't get an income adjustment or bonus, but now I'm expected to handle double the workload of a different job title while still have my Marketing title.My question is this. Is this even ethical?? What are my options, leave?",0

" How Best to Handle Mental Health Disclosure with Work Trigger warning: mental health issues discussedI recently learned a family member may suffer from bipolar disorder. According to spousal confirmation, symptoms have been noticeable for years -- but nothing was ever disclosed to family, friends or any previous / current employers. More to the point, this issue was never addressed with a licensed medical practitioner.This family member recently began a manic episode, with symptoms ranging from delusional thinking / grandiose ideation, lack of focus, non-stop verbal spinning on tangential topics, forgetfulness, high energy, easy distraction, difficulty sleeping, the works. There is cohesiveness for prolongs periods, but it is not consistent and gets interrupted frequently by the manic symptoms. From my understanding, this type of thing has happened before -- but never to this extent and never over prolonged time periods.My family member fully recognizes everything currently happening is not normal and that it all needs to be addressed medically. There has been nothing but full cooperation shown to all the support offered and received. To this end, a trip was taken to an Emergency Room for a psych evaluation.The difficulty of American health system assistance with mental issues, however, is that everything is a slow series of steps. Step 1 includes getting baselines, ruling out medical / chemical reasons for current symptoms and determining potential for violence; Step 2 is getting on the calendar of an actual Psychiatrist for a full / proper evaluation, etc. It is a system ill-prepared to handle someone troubled but not in need of a mandatory loss of freedom for the protection of others.When this manic episode began, my family member had the presence of mind to inform a supervisor they were feeling unwell and needed to stay home. Sick time was used to cover days taken off during that week. As we round the corner into the second week of this issue, vacation days are currently being used until symptoms dissipate -- but no one knows if or when that will happen. This health issue provides nothing but uncertainty for everyone involved.Because my family member is an established remote worker with over a decade of experience and accolades with an progressive organization, there have been no questions about the lost time raised by the employer. One would assume this stance will change if once established deadlines start being missed or lost time becomes a problem.The caretaking team needs to understand, from an HR perspective, how best to address work during this crisis. Until there is an established medical prognosis (the ER triage is not the same as a fully psychological evaluation), it doesn't feel like there's anything we can say -- and once the issue is documented, there's still nothing from stopping an employer from releasing an at-will employee without cause. My family member also has rights as a patient to not disclose this issue, but if something doesn't change soon there will be inevitable consequences.This person maintains a role as sole monetary provider in a marriage with kids. It's understood by everyone involved in this support effort that a loss of employment means a loss of income for a family -- and the removal of health insurance so desperately needed in a moment like this.Any direction that can be provided regarding how best to address a place of work in the midst of these kinds of mental health crisis circumstances are much appreciated.",0
" Fixed-term redundancy - almost 4 years of employment I worked fixed-term since early Jan 2019, covering position of a permanent employee who worked in another department. That person got fully transferred to that department in August 2022. However my position wasn't advertised (so I can become permanent) and I was kept on fixed-term still. This week I was told I am being made redundant because there is no longer enough work in the team and they don't need me. My current contract expires on end of December 2022. I am 7 days short to full 4 years of employment.I understand that if I worked those 7 days I would have automatically become a permanent employee, according to UK law. I am however happy to leave as the workplace is toxic. I am offered a redundancy payment of 3 years. Can I ask for redundancy payment of 4 years? I would have worked for employer for 3 years 11 months and 3 weeks at the end of my contract.Now, some backstory - my line manager was bullied by her manager for the last year and a half. This was reported to HR multiple times, but nothing was done, as the person worked in the organisation for more than 30 years and has connections. My line manager believes there is plenty of work in the department and there is no reason for me to go, and that she will struggle to run a team without me. My line manager was excluded from the decision making process completely, and she didn't know I am being made redundant until I told her so, and she was shocked and upset she wasn't even told.In the letter from HR they don't list reasons for this - simply say you contract ends and here is the money.The question: can I get a 4 year redundancy payment (instead of 3) and what else do they owe me? Or should I not bother and just take money and leave?",0

"Used refrigerator issues, warranty not upheld (Ohio) On October 1st I purchased a used refrigerator from a used appliance and appliance repair shop for 430$. It came with a 30 day warranty and is printed on the receipt ""we are not held liable for damages or loss"". It worked fine for 5 days, then on day 6 I noticed everything in the freezer was thawing out (approximately 100$ in frozen meat). By the time I noticed the meat was thawing it was after buisness hours for the store, so I called them the next day as soon as they opened (Saturday).I was informed a technician would be sent out Tuesday. I ended up donating the food to a local foodbank to avoid it going to waste. Tuesday comes around and I never got a call and the tech never showed. I called at 5:30 to ask where he was since the store closed at 6 and they told me they had no idea and no way to contact him. He never ended up showing up.The next day I called again and spoke with the owner. He informed me the tech never showed up to work, and that he personally would be out the next day to look at it. He came and looked and said it had to thaw out (ice buildup in the back) and he would be back the next day between 3-4. He never showed, so I called at 5:30. He informed me he had ordered parts to fix it, but they wouldn't be in till the next week. He was to come out yesterday (Tuesday) to install the new parts, yet again no call and no show. I tried calling and was told he would come today at noon, something came up. He still hasn't shown up. I tried calling and am receiving no answer.Edit; forgot to add the freezer went out first, the next day the fridge side went as wellI doordash for a living and have wasted many days of potential income waiting around the house for someone to show up that never does. I paid 430 bucks for the fridge. I have lost over 100$ worth of food, not to mention the cost of having to buy fast food or take trips to the grocery store for every meal. Does it seem like I have a case for small claims? Realistically would it be worth it? Can I recoup any of the food costs or does that ""not responsible for damage and loss"" actually hold up?

" How to handle a coworker that actively causes massive issues with work? Somewhat throwaway account. It’s whatever my phone made lmaoI work in an office environment. I’m going to be intentionally vague, but basically, we do numbers and computer stuff and interact with the IRS a lot. Needless to say we have to be accurate with our stuff. If we aren’t, we get tagged with a fine from them. I take pride in my work ethic and work extremely hard to be efficient and effective at what I do.About six months ago a new employee was hired to take half the load of the section of work that I’m in. This was greatly appreciated as I was overwhelmed due to short staffing at the time and was taking on the workload of multiple people. I was optimistic and glad to finally have someone to help me… except they’ve done nothing but make my job and work environment worse.They don’t understand how to use vital programs on a computer for our job (which is a requirement for this job actually), and because of this consistently deletes formulas, references, and other data that I or another worker has to go back, find, and repair. They never understand why things aren’t working out and gets defensive if errors are pointed out. I’ve tried hard to watch and go back over their work when they finish, but without the physical documents we compare it to, there’s only so much I can spot. Our company has been fined multiple times over mistakes that have been made by them that I couldn’t catch. This never happened before and it’s got me stressed tf out.At first I didn’t mind having to go in and correct things for a new person. They’re new, it’s part of the learning process. But it is the same thing every day. For six months. They never remember how to do our job and expects someone to stop their work and come over to guide them through it step by step every day. And it’s never a simple “do this” answer. We have to physically point to the screen to get them to understand they have to click somewhere. I have expressed my frustration multiple times to the supervisor because I cannot fathom why we are keeping someone who actively cannot to this job despite having it for six months, and the only solution made was to push most of that work back onto the rest of us.It is to the point now where they have interfered with my work enough that I genuinely want to quit. I love this job but now I dread coming in on the days we work together because it means that in addition to my own workload, I have to worry about theirs as well. Every pause I get I go in to make sure things aren’t messed up so that we aren’t here all night trying to figure out what they did. On the days they’re off, I’m having to correct things from the past week. I’ve worked a lot of really shitty jobs, and this is the first I genuinely felt I was appreciated at.. but now I’m being paid the same rate as someone with zero problem solving skills and a knack for screwing things up. If their work is worth just the same as the rest of us, then why are we all trying hard not to make mistakes and get fined, you know? I can just not do anything correctly and still keep my job, it seems. But that really bothers me.Anyway, am I wrong to be upset? I certainly don’t want to leave, but I can’t take working with this person anymore. I don’t want to fix mistakes to previously-completed days weeks later because they went back and changed things without telling anyone and left it all wrong and a mess. The lack of response from management makes me think I’m overreacting, even though they’ve scolded us about the fines multiple times.I’m obviously not getting direction from my superiors.

" Possibility of Getting Current Employer to Match an Offer from a Competitor, During a Hiring Freeze? Education/Experience: US-based Chemical/Mat Sci Engineer (Master's) w/ 5 years of Experience in Process Engineeringtl;dr: From HR's perspective, could my current (Fortune 50) employer be able to match an external offer (+16% base pay) when there is a hiring freeze (and potential layoffs) at current company?I enjoy my current role, work-life balance, and colleagues/manager. I've been at the same Fortune 50 company since graduation, and despite promotions believe I'm being a bit  underpaid, but not drastically. However, Current Company has announced some layoffs will be coming, but current word is that my department will not be affected. Even if I don't get laid off, I doubt a significant raise will come at next year's performance review so I won't see a salary raise in the near future.Context on external offer:Former manager, who left Current Company years ago, reached out asking if I wanted to interview for similar role at local competitor company under him. I have received an offer for +16% base pay with a nice signing bonus, but based on the interview the work/life balance will be noticeably worse (1 wfh day vs 3, significantly more on-call time on nights/weekends until I engineer the issues away)In an ideal world, I'd ask my Current Company to match the base pay increase but I'm unsure if my manager would be able to, given the circumstances. And if I ask but don't receive it, if it will add a negative mark in the eyes of my current company. I will say that since I only have a Master's, and most of my colleagues have a PhD, I'm a lower grade level (even newer ones that I'm training, and I have more responsibility than many of the PhDs who have 1-2 years experience). So I'm one of the cheaper employees in my group of ~15 and my manager and his manager both really like me.Does anyone have any insight to this situation; asking for current company to match an external offer (+16% base pay), when there is a hiring freeze at current company?",0

With this, I have 2 female employees, and have recently gotten many complaints that one of them is choosing to no longer wear a bra a work. I understand this is a personal choice by the individual and really has nothing to do with our dress code policy. However, this individual has been known to report other employees for ""leering"" and other similar concerns in the past, and only 1 out of 7 reports came to be true, though still managed to damage other workers reputations as gossip spreads quickly. This employee is also well endowed and is making a lot of other employees uncomfortable as the nature of their work sometimes causes them to be in small, confined areas. Her team members are worried that they are going to be 'next' in her recent slew of reports, and don't know how to comfortably work with her. Today the other female coworker also complained stating that the individual ""seems to be unnaturally swinging her chest around and making it well known that she is no longer wearing a bra""I would appreciate any advice on the situation.Thank youHR Manager",0

"Studying for my exams, and i don't really know where to start in the following question, or any question in the whole chapter tbh, but any help will do. Bobbi Proctor does not want to “gamble” on Social Security taking care of her in retirement. Hence she wants to begin to plan now for retirement. She has enlisted the services of Hackney Financial Planning to assist her in meeting her goals. Proctor has determined that she would like to have a retirement annuity of $200,000 per year, with the first payment to be received 36 years from now at the end of her first year of retirement. She plans a long, enjoyable retirement of about 25 years. Proctor wishes to save $5,000 at the end of each of the next 15 years, and an unknown, equal end-of-period amount for the remaining 20 years before she begins her retirement. Hackney has advised Proctor that she can safely assume that all savings will earn 12 percent per annum until she retires, but only 8 percent thereafter. How much must Proctor save per year during the 20 years preceding retirement?",2

Before we ended the Interview, The HR didn’t say if I am considered instead she just explained what’s the next step supposedly should I get hired.

"Best way to save for a house? (Roth IRA or Robinhood) Hey guys, I was wondering what would be the best way to save money for a house. I don't plan on buying in the immediate future, so don't say cash. Should I open up a Roth IRA and start saving in there, and then use the 10,000 I can take without a penalty, or should I just keep saving and investing through my Robinhood stocks. I am mainly wondering about the tax implications. Are they the same? I thought the whole point of the Roth IRA was so that you didnt have to pay taxes on the growth, but I thought I read that if you take money out for a house, you are taxed on the growth, so if that is the case, how is it different then just regular stock trading.

"How to research an industry's key metrics? This might be a little bit of a loaded question. How does one conduct financial research on an industry and get statistics on that industry to see trends where that industry is going?The statistics I am looking for are the sizes of an industry, the revenues, industry breakdown by sub-sector, during a particular year in the United States. For example, what was the industry's size during 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and in the future? What are the revenues generated in America during a year? Is it possible to get an exact value of this data, or is it really just a forecast/estimate based on past years data and current trends in the economy?Using my Google research there are a lot of websites that sell reports on this information for a particular year (for a lot of money for someone who is not a business), how exactly do they get that information? Each website has slightly different numbers are they just a forecast based on their data/models?The resources I am using right now are:Economic Census Data which seems like an incredible resource but the last year of available data was 2017BLS.gov data which seems to only have 2019 dataBEA.gov for non-industry specific data.Looking at public companies in the industry to see their Revenue Growth, to see industry trends, but I feel like this isn't very reliable, because each company is different and may not follow industry general trends.If there are also any books/articles you can recommend to go more in-depth on the topic that would be greatly appreciated.

" Rumor being spread about me and my cousin at work at we took off our shirts and were ready to beat a piece of shit co-worker, two particular co-workers have claimed that I have told them personally and are dead set on the story, how can I deal with this? Alright so the story:Me and my cousin have been working at this one store for a long while now and there's this one stupid little shit of a merchandiser who feels like he has manager authority despite being at the store for less then a year, he is constantly pestering us as if he was a manager and he has finally got my cousin upset enough for him to speak to a real manager about this kid's attitude, the manager spoke to the little shit but he wasn't listening so my cousin and the manager both confronted him. After the confrontation this little shit has the audacity to say to my cousin ""7 years working here and you can't even be on time"". My cousin works harder then any of the other merchandisers and has more authority then some of the other managers, he comes late but he doesn't take break, so obviously this was quite a nerve stroke. My cousin began approaching the little shit but he wasn't going to hit him, he only wanted to get close to dare the little shit to say it to his face but our manager was behind him and held him back. The situation de-escalated and the little shit moped around for the remainder of the shift HOWEVER suddenly we get call from one of the managers, Trev, who are semi-close with the shit head and we have a conversation (Trev is the name I'll use for the rumor spreading manager), I know Trev is most likely the source of the rumors as certain things have been said to him in private that are also now part of the rumors. Anyways fast forward a few days things seem okay.. But then I get a call from the manager who held my cousin and she's telling me that two merchandisers approached her are claiming I told them ""me and my cousin both took off our shirts and were ready to beat this kid and quit."" The part about taking off the shirt was only ever mentioned to Trev, my cousin told him ""if things continue like this and you wont step up to the plate to fix it I wont mind taking off my shirt and quitting"" but now the rumor goes ""we took off our shirts and were ready to beat this kid's ass"" so we know he and the little shit twisted the story and started spreading rumors and somehow has these two merchandisers claiming I personally told them.I don't know what to do, I know my cousin is on the verge of exploding at these people and I don't want anything bad to happen, we work with one of the rumor spreading merchandisers tmr 4-10 and I don't want my cousin to blow up on him, there are cameras so I know if head manager wanted to investigate he could easily check the cameras and clear our names but the rumors being spread and the fact that now I am a bigger target because they claimed I personally told them makes this a lot harder to deal with, at least for me, if a fight breaks out I don't mind holding my ground but I am horrible with confrontation.",0

"Returns of an interest rate swap I would like to calculate returns for a plain-vanilla (fixed-for-floating) interest rate swap. Consider, that I am long in USD 5-year swap rate, i.e. I'm holding a receiver swap for 5-year swap rate with notional of 100$. At initiation, the swap should be valued at 0$, as both the fixed leg and the floating leg of the swap should have the same value.If I valuate the receiver swap a month later and it would have a value of let's say 2$, then how should I calculate the return? Is it just (2$ - 0$) / 100$, i.e. change of swap value relative to the notional? I can't quite figure out how I could calculate the return by comparing change of value to previous value (or simply comparing consecutive values), as they can be at initiation 0$ and later be negative.If the correct way is indeed to calculate returns relative to notional, then why is this? After all, I am not investing any capital on the swap (apart from some possible margin payments), so why should I use the notional in return calculations? For me a more natural way would simply be following the value of the swap and calculating the returns with consecutive values, but then I face the problems of negative values and zero values mentioned above.",2

"Advice Needed: Recruiter laughed at me when I tried to negotiate my promotion offer by phone. How can I submit a complaint and still negotiate the offer? goverment job Update: I accepted the offer and am drafting a thank you email to my supervisors. I will not email/address the recruiter. I am applying for jobs outside of this company.I work for a TX government entity. This is my 5th year at the company. I was promised a raise a year ago. Today, I was contacted by a recruiter for my title promotion  and raise by phone. He offered me $12K more than what I currently make. I said yes during the call but called back to try to negotiate my salary. I asked for at least $2K more. The maximum for my current position is $7K more than what I was offered. I was denied any change in the offer, so I asked about the maximum yearly promotion rate. The recruiter laughed at least twice. I asked him what was funny and he said he didn't know the answer to my rate question. I ended the call quickly, because I was so furious , felt dismissed and humiliated. After the call, he emailed me an official offer email.How should I handle this situation? I am looking for advice and/or draft edits. My ultimate goal is to speak with a different recruiter and negotiate the salary before I accept the offer. I am leaning towards replying to his email and CC'ingHR, my supervisor and Employee Relations.Here is my email response draft so far:Thank you for your email and offer of (dollar amount) for the Coordinator position. However, I found your attitude during our second phone conversation completely unprofessional. I do not appreciate that you laughed repeatedly while I tried to negotiate for a salary that is closer to the maximum of my current position and asked about the maximum yearly merit rate. There was nothing funny about the conversation. I would expect even a new recruiter to be knowledgeable about general company benefits. Instead of laughing, a more professional and appropriate response would have been to refer me to a coworker that could answer my questions. In my 5 years at (this company), I have never been treated this way by a recruiter. It is so shocking to me that an acquisition 'specialist' would behave this way. No employee should be laughed at and made feel lesser than regardless of their title. I wouldn’t want another candidate to have the same negative experience I did. Before I can seriously consider this offer, I am requesting that a different recruiter, preferably your supervisor, contact me to discuss this position and the benefits further. I have taken the liberty to cc my supervisor, HR, and Employee Relations.",0

Also provide funding to business in the area, who in turn give their profits to the organization.

" Neighbor complaining about smell coming from kitchen vent Hi all,I'm in Los Angeles, CA, and my neighbor has been complaining about the cooking smells coming from my apartment for over a year now. I have tried to troubleshoot and be accommodating to her by not using the cooking fan until my unit was assessed and having the HOA send maintenance staff to check my apartment. Previously, she said that she would invite an HVAC specialist to inspect the units back in October 2020, and I said that I can be available whenever the appointment is scheduled, but she never followed up with me. The maintenance staff inspected my unit in November 2020 and told me that the vent was taped correctly. A couple weeks ago, she brought up the issue again to the HOA board and the HOA sent the maintenance staff again to check on my unit and to inspect her unit for any breaks or leakage in the vents. The maintenance person said that there was no issue on my side and reported back to me that he saw no leakage in her unit. He said that because the building is built with a shared venting system, the smell is leaking into her unit and an easy solve would be to install a carbon filter on either her side or my side. Last night, I was cooking and my neighbor knocked on my door and told me that the issue has not been resolved yet and I had to turn my cooking vent off. I immediately turned it off. Later, I saw that she sent a text to me and the HOA president stating that this was still a persisting issue and I was not to use the cooking vent until this issue was resolved. I wrote back to her and said that the maintenance staff confirmed that it was an issue with the building and not my unit. She claims that she has been living here for 25 years and had no issues until I moved in and renovated my unit. Now she says that she will be retaining an attorney and ask that I cease and desist.Currently, I am trying to contact my HOA president to see what his take on the issue is and if there will be a formal report in place, documenting the assessment of my unit. I wanted to ask, does she have grounds for a case here? Do I need to seek legal counsel?Thank you for your time. I really appreciate your help on this.",1

"$800 Software has completely stopped working per company policy While it is BS that certain functions of QuickBooks get switched off after about three years, it seems outrageous that the version of TeamViewer I purchased ten years ago has, by company policy, been completely disabled as of last month. I'm not sure where I put the original license agreement, but it is hard to imagine they included a clause giving them the right to 100% disable the product. Has disabling software become SOP in the industry? What legal recourse do I have, if any?",1

"What to do after realizing we were scammed 1000’s of dollars from a local company This take place in SOCal Orange County USA. About 7 months ago my wife found a SPA based out of the owners home and used them. She loved them and they’re service, and used them for about 4 months on a biweekly basis. She was than asked by the owner her self if instead of paying every time she visitited, if she’d like to buy a package for multiple visits and save some money. It’s important to know my wife is Chinese and in this community there is undisputed high trust and dealing with others from within your clique. So while she would never usually do this my wife agreed and spent 2k$ on a half years worth of spa treatments. Well Monday rolls around my wife can’t contact the woman or the business, and all of they’re social media is gone. She than contacts an employee who is really upset, the employee tells my wife that the week prior, she gave the shop owner 20k for helping with the business, as they’ve worked together for years and, as soon as she sent it all of the business contacts shut down.We found 17 other customers through my wife’s social media who all had 1k+ packages, and now they’re looking for what to do.Please let me know and what the best route is.

" Tried to tell HR I was being sexually harassed but they kept interrupting/shutting down the conversation I met with my organization's HR rep in a private meeting. I had rehearsed what I wanted to say about what I had experienced: consistent and serious forms of sexual harrassment by someone in the organization with more power than I, as well as bulling and threats by employees senior to me. There is also a heavy ""don't make the organization look bad"" and surveillance culture. It was actually impossible to record or document my harrassment as evidence because workers are not allowed to have phones or to carry anything out of our workspaces. I really did not want to make waves, I just wanted the abuses to stop.Every time I tried to talk, my HR rep would inturrupt me and try to redirect or minimize what I was saying. Every time I tried to continue, they'd do this again. I got very frustrated and started crying. When I did, they said, ""I see no reason why you should be crying.""I felt completely powerlessness and it was as though my brain shut down. I quit soon after.More than what I should have done, I really just want to know what HR rep's strategy was. It seems they they were already prepared with this judo-like strategy before I entered the room. Is this a common HR way to ""handle""/supress complaints?Thank you for your thoughts",0
"Why Is Swedish Krona in the Dollar Index? I recently had a quick look into stuff about currencies, and was surprised to see that Swedish Krona is included in the Dollar Index at a weight of 4,2%, which is higher than Swiss franc (3,6%) and more than 1/3 of pound sterling's weight, even though the Swedish economy is less than 1/5 of UK's economy (plus I imagine both CHF and GBP are traded way more than SEK).So I'm wondering what is the reason behind this? I understand that since most European economies are using Euro now, there are fewer important currencies to pick from, but SEK is still a somewhat surprising currency in the index. Could it have something to do with Sweden being the ""leader"" economy of the Nordics (total GDP of Nordic countries is 50% of UK's GDP), or is it maybe that the behaviour of the Swedish economy or the SEK FX-market reflects the situation of USD very well for some reason (please elaborate)? Or is it maybe just a historical reason?Thanks!",2

I reached out to HR to ask why and  they said they'd look into it. I never heard back. In November I  received a welcome letter from a doctor. Apparently, I hadn't picked a  provider so they picked one for me. But I didn't pick one because I had  no idea I had coverage.

After my talk on Friday with my manager, I sent her an email as documentation about our talk as suggested by a few of you guys. I went into work yesterday and nothing was said to me by my manager about the situation. So I took it upon myself to ask when we'd have a discussion. I asked her if she had even talked to the coworker the first time she touched me, and she said she did not feel it would be a problem after the first touch, so she didn't. I was confused because something should have been said after the first touch. She then explained she was afraid to bring it up this time to the coworker before she left, in fear of the cowokers' retaliation against me. I told her I would be fine and it had to be done.All three of us talked, and the coworker cut me off as I was trying to explain. She would not let me talk, and I had to say ""excuse me, I was speaking"" several times. She tried to throw in details about another situation that occurred. However, they have no relevance to one another. She could not explain to me why she touched me again. I made it very clear I was uncomfortable. I told her that our manager saw the second touch and her eyes got wide. When the conversation was done and she left back to work, my manager said that the co-worker still did not take me seriously and said to call her if things went south that night.When I got home, I sent an email to HR, and I am waiting to hear back from them right now. I feel as though nothing good will come from this. My manager weirdly put me on the schedule for 36 hours this week when I usually work 22–25 hours. But I now know it was for good reason. Even so, I have my resignation letter ready in the drafts. I thought I'd tell everyone that I'm a pharmacy tech in training and that the person harassing me is one of the pharmacists. Maybe that's why they won't do anything because we are short-staffed and they need people. Either way, it's wrong and unacceptable. I'm not sure if I'll update anymore.

" Is being treated differently than others enough for a grievance? I work for a local public agency in California.

"Has my privacy been violated?

" They cancelled on me twice Hi, i was previous employee at a company here in the Philippines and I decided to work with them again. First was I passed my initial interview and final interview plus completing all of my requirements on time. What they did here is they cancelled the start date since the client was no longer looking for agents to hire yet I tried messaging the recruiters multiple times yet a week prior my start date yet they never replied to my messages and I only heard from them 2 days prior my start date telling me that it's cancelled. The second time was I messaged recruitment if they have any accounts available and they told me there was. I applied to that account and they invited me to a job offer discussion and all and when there was a week left I messaged them again to get an update since I never heard anything from them yet they still didn't reply, now two days prior my start date they tell me that I'm no longer eligible for re-hire again. They made go through all the trouble of doing a medical check up and processing my requirements and that's what they tell me. This is just really messed up, they had a lot of time to tell me that I'm no longer eligible for re-hire yet they still gave me false hope.",0

"Doing stuff with an underaged person One of my biggest fears on dating on tinder is going on a date/doing stuff with someone underaged. I’ve seen many profiles on tinder subreddit about people saying they are underaged or a few months from 18 years old. So if I went on a date with someone who’s profile says they’re over 18 or during the night they verbally say they are above 18 and then we do stuff, but later the person reveals they are underaged, what will happen?

" How to approach my job about participation in a medical study requiring a long term inpatient stay? One of my doctors told me about a case study the National Institute of Health (NIH) is conducting that has the potential to help tremendously with a disability of mine.I applied and I completed the initial screening interview. During that interview they told me that due to the use of anesthesia in the treatment process, I would need to stay at the NIH for two months and I would recive the treatment 3 times a week. I work 100% remotely and I asked if I could still work during my stay, they said yes but obviously I wouldn't be able to maintain my current schedule exactly. I mostly passed the initial screening with one potential hang up but the clinician would make the final determination if I could move to the next step of the application.I haven't told my job anything yet because it was just the initial screening. Yesterday the clinician reached out to set up the next screening interview.I'm not quite sure how things work here since it is technically a medical treatment but the study aspect murkies things. My job does offer short term and long term disability policies and they do offer FMLA.How should I approach things if it looks like I will be accepted into the study? Do I have any legal protections because it is treatment for a disability?Edit: National Health Institute -> National Institute of Health",0
"4 year old and dad trespassing. I’m 13 and I live in a neighborhood with at least30 kids, today I went outside and because Ian knocked down sticks me and my friends built a stick fort. We were sitting on the side walk when a bunch of kids 4-7,  unattended and outside started stealing our big stick the whole thing was built on, so we chased them down, I grabbed the stick and went to put it back against the tree, that’s when this little girl whose parents are freaking psychos and think that their kids word is a brand new commandment or something, ducks under the stick on the largest part and let’s go of it, and goes to her dad crying.Thats when a minute later me and my friends are behind the houses, far enough away to not be trespassing, the dad apparently saw us go behind, so I go in my yard and my friends run, they don’t know my friends names or where they live, I go in my house and nicely tell my dad what’s happening when the doorbell rings, dad waits for like 5 minutes before checking around my house and around all the houses, then the dad steps into my garage door (a side door) and looks for me with one foot in, then sends their like 4 year old into the garage to look, of course right now I’m inside and I let my dogs in my backyard. thats when my mom gets home and she and their dad had a talk, but I don’t get in trouble because my mom knows how the parents act.Is this considered either harassment trespassing or stalking?

"Am I liable for my roommate's mistake a year after moving out? Lived with a friend in a house we split in Missouri on a year long lease.  11 months in just before we renew, we have a falling out and she tells me to leave.  We're co-leasing so technically I should have more of a say than that but I don't particularly want to stay, so fine, I leave.  She agrees to pay for the last month on her own and I just don't sign up on the lease renewal.  I don't tell the landlord about it, but I never hear from him either so I just assume I'm not involved anymore.  Now just over a year later I'm hearing roommate is having some trouble and might be formally evicted... but landlord is claiming I'm still a legal resident and that I might be equally liable.So does that make sense if I never signed a lease from 2020-2021?  Can they just renew without your approval?  If I'm still on the lease can I escape it before any legal action is taken?",1
" At what point should I assume my lawyer is padding the bill I have a contract dispute, and I'm very concerned that the lawyer I have hired is ripping me off.  The case itself should be very simple.  Guy (located in Ohio) owes me money, had signed a contract, accepted the final product, made several promises to pay me, never did.  All of this backed up with emails and text messages.The lawyer had several phone calls with the guy, and filed a 10 page complaint filed in Washington district federal court, and had him served.  The businessman never responded to the lawsuit, and so I should be able to get a default judgement, but the lawyer is ready to drop it all together.  This is for a couple reasons,a) the guy is probably judgement proof, he has his companies set up in such a way to make himself immune from any lawsuits (which is probably why he never bothered responding).b) the cost of just filing has drained me of resources.  The work I did for him represents all the money I made last year, and he owes me around $100k.  The lawsuit itself also specifies other damages for unconscionable acts for $1m, plus there is the promise of stock, which he himself had put a value on of another $1m.  Then there is another stock he promised me which never fulfilled.So, I gave the lawyer a total of $7k so far.  Due to some personal issues, the lawyer wasted a lot of time by letting the case sit for months, then going over all the facts a couple times to learn about it again.  So far, he only sent me 1 invoice for $2600, but also includes time written off in the amount of $7,651.  He loves to mention how he did that, but again wasted time was a good amount of that.  So, a total invoice of over $10k.Since then, I have never received another invoice.  He has told me he needs more money, but has never provided me an invoice, even though I have asked.  He finally responded to an email this morning after a week, and told me he will put together an invoice, but it'll be a charge and we can talk about what I'd be willing and able to pay for.Thing is, that first invoice included 2 hours of work on the complaint, and all that has been accomplished since then is finishing the complaint, filing, and serving.  So he would have had to spend about 10 more hours on the 10 page complaint to even have used all the retainer money I sent him.  All together, he claims to have spent $15k+ worth of time just to file a complaint.  No discovery, no depositions, no court days.My case is going to die without even a default judgement because I can't send him more money.  If this is legit, then legal recourse is really out of the realm of normal people.Edit: As a side note, this has really bugged me.  Early on in the discussion, the businessman offered my lawyer a job.  The lawyer disclosed this to me, but he didn't flat out turn it down.  He told me that he was always open to job offers, but we'd have to resolve this case first.  I can't imagine he would screw me over for a potential job with a guy who is clearly a scammer, but it has stuck with me, and there is a part of me which wonders.",1

"BAD SMELLS  There’s a terrible smell coming from the soda fountain area at my job.

We’ve talked to management about it and they’ve done all the steps in their power to solve this issue. Ie: send out a maintenance report to corporate which then sends out the assigned technician for our store to check out the issue. Sometimes we do it multiple times a week but this usually always result in them testing out our equipment saying there’s nothing wrong and marking it off as fixed. Some days it’s worse than others but it’s getting to me, when I have 20+ customers complaining about the same thing that caused my headache for the day.

" FMLA / LoA Question! FMLA QuestionHi!Not sure if this is the correct thread, but appreciate any help y’all can provide!Here’s the situation:Me, 29yo female employed as full time project manager (salary + benefits) at a tech firm. My company provides Short Term Disability insurance for a FMLA leave of absence (60% of weekly pay, up to 12 weeks). I submitted a LoA request and claim is being evaluated now.The context - I am currently dealing with cervical spine stenosis / annual fissure (tear) in my c5-c6 disc that’s causing nerve damage from the disc space narrowing. My left hand periodically goes numb and I have trouble with bladder control. More significantly - I am in extreme pain at the end of every workday, it’s a dull aching the rest of the time. I am a candidate for surgery and am undergoing testing now (neurological + CT scan) to justify and schedule the disc replacement surgery.The injury was borne from being a hospice caregiver to my father this year before he passed, as well as working ~60 hours / week from under resourcing at my job (I used to take calls from his bedside at times). I took a 3 week LoA for bereavement but was forced to come back early due to leadership change.My question: this FMLA leave and request seems to be centered around a surgery date, of which there isn’t one yet. Truthfully - I can’t do this job anymore as I feel like the stress is literally eroding me. I’ve been saying for ~7 weeks that I am drowning, if anything the workload has gotten worse, and this LoA is the only thing that has gotten management to listen. HR has been 0% helpful on all fronts.What happens if for some reason I don’t have the surgery during the leave? Leave is scheduled to begin 11/14 and my CT myelogram is scheduled for 11/22.My doctor will 100% sign off on needing a leave, but do I need to update my claim? What should I do??",0
"Failed court ordered drug test So when I was 19, I was pulled over with some weed and charged with felony possession. Almost 2 years later I began a non-adjudication program that included scheduled drug tests.

" Dramas in the company I work, could you give me an advice? Good morning Reddit,There are some problems going on at the current company where I work, and I'm not getting a good handle on it, it never seems to stop.The company started less than two years ago in Portugal and the head office is in Germany. I started as Front Office Manager, then we recruited controller, accountant, marketing, now IT, etc.However, I am not the human resources of the company. I am not in charge here, although I have been appointed as manager. But honestly I'm getting tired of all these dramas.Since a girl from Marketing came in, the dramas started. The accountant and the controller are very good friends and they don't like the way the Marketing girl is dealing with some issues, as she is creating dramatic situations. They put my name in the mix, accuse me of having already talked to her about things and that she is against me.The truth is that the marketing girl is not acting well, and we have all talked to her. But the accounting girl and the controller aren't either, and the controller girl is having such an attitude towards me that it seems like she is the boss of the whole thing.I wanted to ask what kind of attitude I should have towards this, because I'm tired of dramas, I'm tired of everything coming to me, I'm tired of putting up with these ""Boss"" attitudes when they are not in charge here, but because they speak German they think they rule this place...I emphasize that I don't want to be the boss here or anything, I just want to do my job in peace, without having to put up with all this drama. I feel that the controller girl has an inner urge to move up in life and feels that she is not being appreciated. I have it too, but I don't make that feel in the company.After these last events the desire to leave is greater and greater to be honest.",0

"How to deal with non-responsive company in arbitration or small-claims? Hello all, I am asking in order to get some information about how to proceed. I have been a Flickr PRO member for a few years, earlier this year my membership was revoked by Flickr for ""breaking terms & conditions"", and locked me completely out of my account and thereby locking me out of ALL of my photos, and whereas I have an idea why this could have happened, when I have attempted to contact them to amicably deal with the situation I get zero response other than a ""this happened and we do not give out details regarding membership revokes"".Under their terms & conditions while they have stated their right to at any time revoke a membership they have also given the possibility to enter into dispute arbitration via the AAA. I am based in the EU and had no idea how this would work so I spent a couple of weeks sending messages to Flickr (email, support form, Twitter support) asking ""how do we get this started?"" - zero response. So, I finally figured out the arbitration website, filled out their consumer arbitration form, included all my info, paid the fee and opened a case. The case was accepted and is being processed - but still ZERO response by Flickr. I hunted for their mail address because I needed to send them a registered letter with all the filed paperwork, and although I think I found the right one (nothing on their actual website) the letter has been waiting to be picked up for 2 weeks now.So, the AAA has sent two reminders to Flickr to please respond, and I have a feeling that they won't. If the arbitration process fails, then, apparently I can take Flickr to small-claims court in California. I have NO idea if that will make them respond, or even how to get in touch to tell them that I am going to do that. How does this work with a completely non-responsive company?I would be happy with either re-opening my account, or giving me a chance to remove my photos - but I can't get anywhere if they don't respond...thanks for any info.",1

This is the 3rd time in state history the voters have approved this kind of bill and the WA Supreme Court keeps overturning it... they said it is unconstitutional because it combined more than one subject in one initiative, something the state constitution forbids. 8/9 justices also said it had a misleading title.Could I make a new initiative to make vehicle registration free? Could I make a new initiative to ban vehicle registration altogether unless if you aren't a citizen?",1
" Need advice: how do I avoid being terminated for my health issues? Hi everyone - I am new to Reddit so apologies if I’m doing this wrong, but I could really use some unbiased advice about the situation I’m in. This is going to be a long one, but please stay with me!I currently live in the US and work remotely for a large, Fortune 100 tech company. I’m in an inside sales position and have been in the role for a little over a year. Now I’m going to get pretty personal…I have been struggling with endometriosis for most of my adult life (I’m 25). I have been managing my symptoms with medication, and it’s mostly been fine. I  always have pain for a few days each month but rarely (if ever) to the point of it impacting my work. However, at the beginning of this year, that changed.I had to switch my medication due to another health complication, and the new medication I’m on isn’t working. My endometriosis pain has worsened significantly over the course of the year. The last 3 months, in particular, have been an absolute battle for me.I am in debilitating pain for nearly 2 weeks each month, and I’ve had to take days off from work due to being unable to even stand. I’ve had to be physically carried to and from the bathroom, have had mood and sleep issues, and have experienced severe dizziness and vomiting from the pain. I only mention this to emphasize that when my time of the month comes, it’s quite literally unbearable.That being said - I have obviously been on an aggressive search for a new treatment plan and have been seeing many doctors. Due to the nature of this condition, I’ve needed to get several opinions, and it’s looking like surgery is my only option. All of these appointments have also caused me to miss work (and I will be missing more in the future for the surgery). So not only has this been taking a toll on me mentally and physically, it’s taking a toll on my work performance as well.I am worried, given that sales is a very results-driven and numbers-driven field. For the past two months, my performance has dipped due to my health issues. Reports have come out from our operations team that are showing a decline in my metrics, and my manager finally asked me about it today. I gave a generic excuse. I know I probably should’ve discussed what’s been going on much sooner before ever letting it get to this point, but here’s the problem: I’m the only female on an all-male team, with a male boss.Our entire team of 10 people consists of men in their 30’s-40’s, and I just haven’t felt comfortable having this deeply personal conversation with my manager. Looking back, I wish I had just been more mature about it and been honest, because having the conversation now will only look like an excuse. I haven’t reached out to HR yet either because I don’t want to step on my managers toes or go behind his back. I’m not even sure how that whole process works or if that’s even the right thing to do here.I really love this job, the company, and my team, but I feel like I’m on thin ice (and if not yet, I will be soon). With the recession, my company has been laying people off and there has overall been stricter oversight and higher expectations from the sales organization. The timing of all of this just couldn’t be worse.I would really appreciate any advice anyone can offer on how I should proceed and what kinds of rights I might have as an employee. I am hoping I can still get out ahead of this if it’s not too late. I should add that I’m normally the type of employee to go above and beyond - even working late and on holidays if need be. With the exception of these recent health issues, I rarely take time off (and even when I do, I make sure I can still be reached by my coworkers). I truly want to make things right and keep this job, even if it means having a somewhat-awkward conversation.",0

" Time off new employee I started a corporate managerial job in Canada at the end of August and training lasts about two months - still in training. Part of the benefits we receive is paid time off and I’ll have about 4 days accumulated before the end of the year. If we don’t take the time off before dec 31, then those hours go to waste and you don’t get extra pay. General corporate guidelines is you shouldn't take time off in December for various reasons.So I am wondering does it leave a bad impression to use my paid time off hours even though I have only started recently? So really, after training, it’ll be November and I’ll have just that month to use 4 days off. Should I just let it go to waste or use it?",0
"In the Johnny Cash song One Piece At A Time, would the protagonist be charged with one act of grand theft, or thousands of acts of petty theft? The song details the story of a Cadillac assembly line worker who, fed up with seeing Cadillacs every day knowing he'll never have one of his own, elects to get one outside the law. His plan is to, over the course of two decades, steal one car part every day to ultimately assemble an entire vehicle. He'll get it one piece at a time, and it won't cost him a dime.So-as far as the law is concerned, were Cash arrested after his scheme came to fruition, would he have committed a single act of stealing a vehicle or many thousands of acts of stealing individual pieces? Would he be judged based on the whole of his crime, or the literal sum of its parts?",1

If they say....ah no problem you have flex time..no need for FMLA, should I insist on FMLA because of the legal protection?

"I do furniture assembly for iIkea, they have a new company policy that says I have to anchor all the furniture I assemble and if the customer refuses I’m supposed to abandon the job or I can be held liable for tipping injuries. Is this true? So as the title says this new ikea policy says that if a piece of furniture can be anchored to a wall, I’m required to anchor it. Even little things like nightstands. If the customer doesn’t want me to put holes in the walls then I’m supposed to tell them I can’t do the job and I have to leave.The problem is 9/10 customers don’t want things anchored. If I just leave all of my jobs I won’t make any money, (I get a small cancellation fee if the customer refuses vs getting paid for the whole job).I’ve been getting around this by having the customer agree in writing that they don’t want me to anchor the item and that they will anchor it themselves when they are able. I do this through the chat function in the app they use to hire us. These chats are archived.We are allowed to make other business agreements through the chat function such as price negotiations and adding additional costs. If the customer agrees in the chat then the company backs it up.So my question is, if a customer agrees in writing to have me leave an item un-anchored, and then an item falls over causing injury or damage, can I actually be held liable?",1

He wants a total of ~$150 to post the house on various places. I suppose it makes sense for us to pay this even if we only get out of our lease for a month, but it strikes me as odd.

"What lengths must I go to return a deposit? Bought a property a few years ago, the management company ran its invoices one year in arrears so my solicitor secured a deposit from the seller to cover these, with the intention of returning the remainder to the seller once the invoices were up to date from when we purchased to property.A few months ago I received a letter from my solicitor with a cheque in it basically saying: we have spent X many years trying to return remaining balance to the seller through their solicitor and we haven’t heard anything back. We have even sent them a cheque a year ago and it wasn’t cached so we are going to release the funds to you.The value of the cheque is in the hundreds, so not an insignificant amount of money. Especially when energy bills are going up the way they are. I have contacted the estate agent to see if they have a contact number for the seller to see if they can put us in touch and I can transfer the money to them but have heard nothing back. I don’t know their name so can’t look them up and the estate agent can’t tell me due to GDPRUltimately it is their money, they deserve to have it back.

So I'm going to say no, I don't have a misdemeanor. He also stated if I can be candid with them, to do so.

" Should I tell my prospective/past manager about major surgery? Hi! I am a graduate student who has interned at a company 2x. I am still in their system as an on call employee, and was supposed to work for them this past summer. They send out returning offer letters the day you leave, and offer no extensions, so I had to sign yes or no over a year ago, and I said yes. However, I had a verbal agreement with my manager that if I failed my exams, I would be unable to return as an intern as scheduled because my PhD has to come first. (about 50% of people fail this exams on the first try so we knew it was likely)I failed, and emailed him, but it turned out he was promoted to a different, more technical role and there was a new manager. I informed the new manager that I had to back out of my agreement, and he was very accomodating, offering to push my start date (it was too late bc as soon as I failed I took on research load after the retakes since I needed to fill my summer) and they took it in stride, and I said I would love to return in the future, which they said they would really like!Now, a 3rd manager   has asked if I am coming next summer, as through the grapevine ""I would love to return in the future"" meant I was PLANNING on coming specifically NEXT SUMMER. They have been holding a spot for me during recruiting apparently and need to confirm and have me sign a new contract.I, in theory, would love to work there next summer-and want to retain my relationship with this department in this company-But I have a prophylactic double mastectomy scheduled-I will be out of commission for months. I have no choice I cannot come, and I will be uber behind on school work so I cannot come off cycle.My main question is which will hurt a relationship more: Me ""flaking"" again without justification, after in their mind I promised to come back on a set timeline, or them starting to worry I am medically complex (even if they are supposed to not care, they 1000% will, based on my peers experiences with chronic medical conditions and employers).",0

"$594 Insufficient Notice Fee Hello all.I'm nearing the end of my lease and my apartment manager is telling me I have to pay a $594 insufficient notice fee because I gave my 60 day notice about 10 days late.

"Manager displaying inappropriate behavior at work I've worked for the same company with my boyfriend for the last 3.5 years. We've been together about 2.5 years, and over that course of time, I've had some unsettling feelings about one of the female managers we work with. My boyfriend told me about one year ago that he thinks that ""she has a crush on me"" and that she once said something that he didn't quite hear, but what he thought he heard was a suggestive comment. Over the last couple of months, she's also said some things to me that definitely confirm she has at least been taking the time to develop thoughts about my boyfriend, such as teasing him that other female associates have a crush on him, telling me, ""I mean, it makes sense - good looking guy who's there to help out hahaha right?"" And I just sort of looked at her with a grossed out expression and a sarcastic ""um.. yeah..."" and walked away. The other day we were talking about an Australian woman who comes to visit her dad where we work (we work in healthcare), and she said to me, while my boyfriend was standing right next to me, to ""imagine if he (my bf) had an Australian accent, with his body type, lol you'd be beating women off of him left and right hahaha"" to which I also didn't respond to. Then, a few days later, my boyfriend and a couple of other people in the room were talking about working out. I mentioned as that it was humorous that I used to use a music technique book for guitar lessons called ""pumping nylon,"" that had a flexed bicep on the cover, parodying the Schwarzenegger doc ""pumping iron."" My boyfriend mentioned what Schwarzenegger's arm were and said ""yeah, my measurement is only about 15, Arnold's were like 22."" (Honestly can't remember what he said Schwarzeneggers were, so, sorry Arnold, if I'm misquoting that). She proceeds to walk up to my boyfriend and say ""OH SO LIKE THAT WOULD BE LIKE THIS FOR YOU."" And starts to put her hands around his upper arm to demonstrate the difference. I literally just walked straight out of the room with no words when she she got close enough to make it obvious what she was doing. Thank God I have the kind of boyfriend who just left the room and followed me out, but that was just another obviously degrading behavior on her part. I can let some things go as being human error, because people say and do things sometimes without really catching themselves, but she's done this numerous times. She is at least 11 years older than my 25 year old boyfriend. She is also married, and has four kids. I have talked to him about how I won't accept being treated in a way that makes it seem like I have no concern for how people at work or anywhere else view our relationship, and if he invites behavior like that from others, I have to reconsider our relationship. I refuse to just let things like this happen, and I've been considering talking to HR about it, but don't want to do so if they'll just brush it off. Does anyone have any input as far as what to do would be? I would approach her about it, but it's not my place to do so as much as it is his. He is the one being actively harassed, but I'm also part of this as well, because it reflects on how others see me.",0

I also have a slight mental disability.I earn minimum wage by hourly rating, no monthly pay.Since started working there I saw many ""red lights"" alarming me about the Manager's behavior.Please advise what to do?Very often work hours are from early morning or up to late night. In which buses are not available to get me home. As a result I had to take a taxi at my own expanse a few times and even walk for almost 2 hours by foot several times when taxis weren't available. Taxi drive home costs more than I earn daily so doesn't make sense for me. The manager is obligated to pay for transportation but only cover bus rides.",0

" I just landed a job that I discovered was replacing someone on a temp leave what is HR planning? I was super excited after being unemployed for a few months to land a 6 month contract to hire role with a big company with good pay. I just found out today however (my 2nd day of work) that my role is/was replacing a someone who’s been on a leave and is coming back at the end of the month.Where does that put me apart from pinning me up against someone who already knows all the software and has good relationships vs a newbie trying to figure things out and will make mistakes along the way invetilby. I don’t know if I should bring this up to them or just secretly look for a new job. But I’m at will right now on this contract, I do need the money but I don’t want to invest time and effort into something that ultimately might get me fired for no reason.They told me that they will have her do a little bit of everything but it sounds like they don’t really have a solid plan in place for her which probably means they don’t have one for me either. I’m just so frustrated and exhausted because this is my 10th job I can’t seem to land a non toxic permanent position all I keep getting is these temp roles that never amount to anything and it’s lowering my self esteem and value. What would you do?",0
" My boss keeps asking me what I’m sick with I told my boss I was sick and then a couple days later I updated him I’m still sick and still can’t come in to work. He asked what I have and I just ignored him. Then a couple days later I gave him my 3rd doctors note and said I can’t come in and he said “what’re your symptoms? have you been taking any medication for it?” He’s always really upset when I’m sick saying “we really need you to come in we’re really short staffed”. Mind you, I work with kids. I’m not going in until I’m 100% better because I don’t want to get them sick.",0
"Airbnb cancellation situation- misread policy, maybe under duress? Followup to this if you're actually willing to read the whole thing:https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLegal/comments/ufg1tz/airbnb_host_strongarming_me_afraid_contacting/I booked an Airbnb for a 12 week stay while I do an internship. The host cancelled a couple days back, citing a trashed room, just 3-4 weeks before the start date. At this point, rates are much higher for this area. I asked him if he's able to let us stay in the trashed room or couch while it's being repaired, as we don't have options. He gives me his number so we can talk outside of Airbnb, where he proposed we don't use Airbnb, but I send a security deposit. I tell him I'm not comfortable sending money to a stranger, but offer pay-on-arrival or him relisting his properties on Airbnb. He opens up 2 new listings (one for the first 6 weeks, one for the last) for a total of about $1,100 more than the old one, and basically tells me tough luck. I book because we have no housing and I see a 48 hour full refund cancellation policy, while looking for a new place.As luck would have it, tonight I found a friendly guy renting a room closer to the original rate I paid. He was willing to sign tonight, told another guest looking at the room it was booked, and I went to cancel the Airbnb booking.Well, only the listing that was for the second half of the stay had the 48 hour full refund, as the first one was closer than in the next 28 days. I'm fully aware this was my oversight.Like an idiot, I contacted Airbnb support and told them about the host's out-of-policy proposal, and asked for a refund. They basically said policy is policy. At this point, I believe they will have informed the host about what I've accused him of. I messaged the host politely asking if he could ease his cancellation policy, but based off his prior actions I doubt he will.So now I've signed 2 rental agreements, one with landlord who will take any opportunity to make money and will not let this cancellation happen (well, with Airbnb mediating it), the other with a very nice person who I'd like to stay with, and equally not reneg a contract with.Is there any course of action I can take to get that money back for the first booking from Airbnb?Wondering if I can potentially use this: airbnb.com/help/article/1320/extenuating-circumstances-policy",1
" Should I preemptively call HR about my coworker telling other coworkers I'm a racist?  Thank you all for your help and advice. HR met with her and the boss last week. She is now accusing 4+ more people of racism and refusal to train. I heard from another coworker that she is lying about her experience. The boss asked for a copy of her resume, but no one was about to produce it. I'm more than a little frustrated because I'm scheduled to work with her this week. I expressed my concerns and I feel that they've been ignored. I'm tired.I work for a national company based out of Florida, so that is where corporate HR is located. We travel around the country for work. One of the people I work with when I'm at my home location just told our manager that I refused to train her because she's brown. First, I did train her. Second, I'm not a racist! I'd never say anything like that and I'm sad and angry that she would make those accusations. My manager told me she was investigating, but I'm wondering if all of you think I should go to HR preemptively to let them know I am aware of the accusations and that they are false. Thank you all for reading.",0
"Stayed full year paying month-to-month fee. Am I entitled to a refund? So there's this really annoying dripping noise in my apartment, and I decided to move out because the landlord refused to fix it. I lost my job shortly after signing a month-to-month lease, and have been waiting to find a new one before moving. The way things are going, I'll stay here over a full year on a month-to-month lease, which has a built in 10% fee. I asked my landlord for a refund given what seems fair, but they refused.

" Should I ask for an updated job description? I recently transitioned into a product manager role within a new department in a completely different division. It leverages my background well and gives me room to grow - I build strategy around software tech, marketing, sales, etc. I love it because I’ve always wanted to be in strategy. However, this group was only formed this year and staffs a lot of prior software/electrical engineers as other PM’s which carried over their job band - I’m technically a mechanical engineer, so this helped boost my salary as an internal transfer.Here’s the problem: this division does several org changes a year (it’s basically a start up getting its legs within a very big company) and I got a heads up that parts of my job will likely be spread across other groups, leaving me to think my role is going to change completely. Since nothing has been made official I’m just carrying on until we get the official announcement. I have a gut feeling that I will be put into a technical group (software/electrical) based on some details. If that happens, I’d like to prepare for some conversation around expectations/performance because I don’t think I’d succeed in this type of role.  How do I go about asking for clarity in my new job (in writing)? The only thing I can think of asking for is an official job description to get expectations in writing. I want to believe there is a business justification with all these org changes and HR would have to be part of that but not sure what my options are.",0
" Curious if this is harassment and if I should report it A few months ago, a new director was hired at my company. This person is not my direct boss, but I interact with them daily. I am not sure if I am overthinking this or if there’s a problem with his behavior. This is the list of “weird” incidents:The first day we met, the very first thing he said to me after hello was “you look so good.” There are now near-daily comments on my appearance and what I’m wearing. Always “positive,” but it is constant, to the point I try to wear very plain and normal clothes to avoid interacting with him.Barely a week after meeting him, a gift was left on my desk from him. It was a fairly expensive gift.On my birthday, an astrology book was left on my desk with my birthday earmarked.I was already uncomfortable about the gifts, but then a few weeks later he asked me to come to his office. He tried to get me to climb up to a loft area — I was wearing a dress and he would have been standing below me. I refused and he left the room but his laptop was open pointed in my direction. It was very strange and I was concerned that he was recording, so I just stood there for two minutes and pretended I had gone to look at the loft.I believe I made it clear that I was not receptive to any advances by being very short with him and there were a few weeks where I felt like I was being “punished.” Being told no just to be shown who is the boss. I still feel this way sometimes.At our last video call, after answering, he pointed the camera at his crotch. I didn’t know what to do and said I couldn’t see his face. He finally moved the camera after a moment and said he was just trying to show me his dog.Am I overreacting or is this a pattern? Like I said, the appearance and outfit comments have remained constant. There are also lots of other examples of employee code violations but none of them are harassment related so I didn’t think I should include them.",0

" How do I know if I left money on the table? I got an offer and I’m happy. It is a 50% raise and a promotion and a half.But as I look back on the process, I can’t help but wonder how I know if I left money on the table or not?When I think about it, at the phone screen, I was the one who gave the salary range. So I set the min/max.But I had no real sense of how to price it. I’m in a fairly specialized field so I can’t just search “communications manager” on these salary websites. I just knew what a couple friends make and there myself in that mix.The company came in at the 1/3 point of my range, I countered, and they came back in the middle of my range. And fast too, it took 40 minutes for them to respond to my counter with a new offer.So while I’m happy, I also can’t help but think about how this process worked. What if I had given numbers that were 20% higher? Or for all I know, did they have to stretch and reprice the salary band higher to get me? I guess I’ll find out soon enough there are two other people on the team with the same title as me.",0

" Handling potential harassment I have a coworker who annoys me, and I feel like lately it's crossed the line from annoying to harassment. She's purposely left me out of company parties, out of office hangouts, and is passive aggressive in tone when speaking to me. The issue that I felt actually crossed the line is that she left me out of a group email informing everyone that another coworker had tested COVID positive.I did comment to our manager about that particular incident, and since then, she's been noticeably nicer to me. However, I'm worried that this is temporary. Is it worth going to HR now when nothing has really happened, or should I wait if/until something does?",0
 how is unemployment calculated with FMLA and vacation? I was just terminated. I've been reading unemployment is calculated using a year of base pay.

"How long is an officer able to go without filing a police report? For reference I live in Wisconsin.The event took place back in April. A police officer was sent to me out for risk of a school shooting or Bomb threat. Realistically, my employer was swatting me because they knew I was triggered by police because of PTSD.On June 29, I asked for a copy of any and all information associated with me, and that specific officer on that date in April. Because the police report would have been about me, I would’ve been entitled to see it. Not only that during the interaction I disclosed the child abuse my employer does. It was a police officer, that would’ve been documentable information. The message I got from the public records department was that there was no information related to my request, including a police report. I spoke with one of the officers colleagues, and he called the officer personally and we found out that it was a welfare check, something I didn’t know where perceive was happening, and that it was a non-documentable event.I filed a complaint against my employer with the state of Wisconsin, and suddenly there is a police report that my employer was able to obtain. however in June, when I made a request to see that sort of information, the public records department acknowledges that there is no  document, and I have a police officer on record stating that it was not documentable event.Something sounds really fishy, because the officers report does not sound or look anything like the conversation we had. and based off the public records department as well as statements from another officer, there should be nothing on the event. But somehow after June, there is some thing on the event.I don’t know what to do, and if there’s a police report being made almost 2 1/2 months after the event, I don’t know if I can trust its validity.",1

"Signed contract for solar panels under false pretenses My parents signed a contract with a company for solar panels on our house. In their correspondences with the companies that they researched they were adamant on getting micro inverters so that if one panel breaks the others still work. The alternative is to have only one mega inverter and if that breaks then the whole system shuts down.My dad asked through email to include the micro inverter in the contract. We installed the panels back in October and recently (in January 2022) found out that none of it is working at all. My dad found out that it’s because the solar panels aren’t micro inverters they have a mega inverter instead and that the whole system died and never worked.The reason why it’s better to have micro inverter than mega is because if it breaks you can have the other panels still working, but when the mega breaks you have to have the company fix it and that depends on if you have a warranty. The company doesn’t even provide/guarantee warranty.It turns out in the contract they wrote Micro inverter and next to it they wrote (“and comparable”). The company is arguing that they put something comparable to the micro inverter which is the mega inverter. It’s stupid because a mega inverter is not comparable to a micro inverter because it is something completely different that we never even wanted.Do we have a case here? It seems they lied and didn’t give us what we asked for during the negotiations and put a hidden word in the contract. It’s stupid because a mega converter isn’t even comparable to a micro inverter. My parents paid $20,000 for this and it doesn’t even work.",1

" I think I made an oopsie- working remotely out of state Hi everyone, early this year I started as a W2 contractor (I don’t get a 1099 but rather a W2). My first third-party client was in AZ (where I live) but when my contract ended, my employer found me a client in Texas and relocated me there. In my team, we had several people working remotely from different states so I asked my manager at the third-party client if I can work from my home state and he was fine with it, so I took his advice and would work from my home town from time to time. This was a verbal conversation and not written in writing.After scouring this subreddit for a while, I realize that there can be some ramifications to my actions. Since I was required to relocate to TX, I am paying TX taxes (I know there’s no state tax). But I only now realize that if I work from another state (even just one day), then I (and my employer) would need to pay that state’s taxes too (in this case, AZ). It hadn’t occurred to me to ask my actual employer to ask if they were okay with me working remotely back in AZ; however, I also read my contract and nowhere did it say we were required to stay put in the state if we were working remotely.I guess my question is, now that damage has been done, what can I do? Do I just come clean to my employer that I worked out of state for maybe a few weeks each month these past few months? I also know I can be terminated as a worst case scenario and of course, I don’t mind paying AZ taxes come tax time since that’s the right thing to do.

"Do I Need To Run My Own Background Check? If So, How? Okay, I’ll try to keep this short: Nearly 4 years ago I gave birth to my child who was perfectly healthy and I was perfectly healthy and all was well. My mother who I had not spoken to in over ten years for major reasons (like scamming me into a life insurance policy after getting a job in life insurance, which I paid on and she cashed in on and putting her mortgage in my name when I turned 18 and never paid on among MANY other messed up things), heard I was pregnant and that my ex left me while pregnant and she took me to court for custody of my child. It was like living in the twilight zone.She called the department of child services and told them I was on drugs so then we engaged in 6 months of absolute BS in court. I won obviously but it was after months of hair follicle drug tests (which, for those who don’t know is a CHUNK of hair), multiple court dates, multiple home visitations from dcs etc.When I got pregnant I was not aware for 12 weeks due to having only one working ovary and only 3-4 periods a year so I was honest with my doctor about smoking cannabis because I wanted to know if my baby was going to be okay since I didn’t know for so long. The baby was fine and I stopped taking my medication and stopped smoking cannabis. With that being in my medical history, the judge and my mother/ her lawyer really held that over my head but it was clear I stopped since drug tests in the hospital and all subsequent tests showed I was clean. The judge said I should be charged with child endangerment because I admitted to smoking while pregnant (this was at the second court date out of 5). I’m in Tennessee and I guess that’s a thing here since it’s not legal. I was never told I was being charged with anything and I won so I don’t think I have anything to worry about and I’d assume I would know if I was charged with child endangerment but I’m up for a job teaching children (which is what I went to school for and did before the pandemic).Should I run a background check on myself to be sure and if so, how can I know what background checks are reliable? I did one meant for employers under my LLC and it came up totally clean but I can’t help but worry. Should I call my old lawyer?

Over the time I was there working as a freelance engineer I lent my equipment to aid use of the rehearsal room as well as stored a few inexpensive but highly favoured microphones there for recording.Unknown to me, the guys running the studio had fallen behind on the rent and the first I knew of it was when a band turned up to rehearse and th owner of the building that was sublet to us changed the locks.There were a whole bunch of arguments had between the studio owners and the property owner but once they had reached an accord and the dust settled I visited the property owner to ask for my stuff back.He told me that my stuff along with the other studio equipment that he owned is in storage  in a neighbouring town and it would be a week before he had time to go there.

" Reporting two cases of sexual harassment I (26F) work for a large tech company in a technical, customer facing role. I got a new manager on July 1 (40s F) who has constantly made comments on my appearance. It started with her just telling how beautiful of a face I have, but has progressed to about a month ago when she told me she sees my face in her dreams because I am so beautiful. These comments make me uncomfortable, and I've told her twice that I didn't appreciate the comments. They do seem to have somewhat slowed down, but I wouldn't say completely. Last week, I was traveling to visit a customer out of the country. While there, I decided to meet up for dinner with another customer who I have been working with for several months (virtually). We exchanged numbers on whatsapp, and he was disappointed when I invited him to dinner with everyone (meaning the 3 coworkers I traveled with) instead of alone. He accepted the invite ""under the condition him and I could still vet tea/coffee/drink afterwards, just the two of us, assuming I didn't have too many glasses of wine at dinner"" (quote from him text). I replied ""haha deal"" but it did make me uncomfortable. When we met for dinner, he immediately hugged me. He told my coworkers that he was not married, constantly told me how pretty I am, asked me to ditch my coworkers afterwards to hang out with him alone and go for a walk in a quiet part of town, and encouraged me to keep drinking more alcohol. My coworkers picked up on the situation, and made excuses for me as to why I couldn't stay with him and had to leave with them. Upon returning, I told my other coworker (who did not travel with us) about what had happened since he was working on this account with me. He was disgusted, told me that this customer was married with a 6 month old child, and that he wasn't going to continue working with him either. He talked to his manager (who is my managers peer) about it and asked what to do. They asked why I didn't report this to my own manager and I told them that I think she sexually harasses me too. I didn't really mean to say it, as I didn't want to tell anyone, but I was very distraught. My second line manager ended up emailing HR about both scenarios and I have an employee relations manager and investigator assigned to my case(s).My questions are:What does the Employee Relations Manager do?Are my managers actions sexual harassment?How does the investigation work if she has only said these things in my 1:1s with no witnesses?Is there anything I should be prepared for before meeting the investigator?What happens if I cry during the investigation? Silly question I know, but I worry about my own triggers.I appreciate the input in advance! I haven't been sleeping as I'm nervous to be fired, and this whole situation has made me feel so disgusting. Hoping it will all be done soon!",0

" I accepted an offer last week and now wish to move forward with a different position in the same company. What should I do? On 11/2 I accepted a position with a local university here in town. I had interviewed for another position as well, that committee members were aware of, as they interviewed me for both. Thing is, today I got a call saying they’d like to offer the other position as well. This one was my #1 choice and I of course was ecstatic to here this. But now HR is saying that I can’t accept that one since I am considered an employee and would have to have a 6 month probationary period before moving to a different department. But I haven’t even had my first day yet. I reached out to HR to see if there is any recourse here or if I’m stuck with accepting the first position. I of course am grateful for the one I accepted but the other position comes with a 10k/yr salary difference which is not chump change for my family.Have any of you been through something similar? Any advice?",0
"Does the Efficient Market Hypothesis limit one's rational to buying based on performance of a company? Or in other words, the CAPM model?Because there is more than enough proof to show GME's bullish sentiment being geared around provoking a squeeze rather than how the company performs.The best test to this hypothesis (GME's SI speculation) comes up in a few months where the company will begin paying dividends out.  Thus, if the rumor is true, every institution and or market maker who has borrowed and or created shares and these shares have been bought and held, they will be responsible for paying a dividend on a massive scale that could potentially force unpayable margin calls and liquidation of assets to meet the massive demand. If we see a sudden collapse in the market-maker speculated doing this, we'll see a bubble popping that will likely spread it's poison around the rest of the markets both domestically and internationally (just like 2008). Moreover, we will see raw proof behind EMH's short-coming where buying done was reflected on information not available, but speculated. Even though findings are getting closer and closer to the truth, there is still not a 1:1 finding that completely proves the speculation.The stock market should be about buying stock sold from a company, not around speculation and chasing a short-squeeze. To correct this, populating a SI real-time would be an efficient checks and balances however, if the hypothesis turns out to be true, it would likely take a complete overhaul of the markets and everyone complicit in allowing this to be a trusted function.  Until then, the bubble will grow.Reference:GME was short 140% January 2021 which has given raise to the alternative strategy in buying stock and equally making the company itself, independent from the given irrational model for return. If buying a company's stock isn't about returns from the company, but rather, returns from a short-squeeze from institution(s) and a market-maker abusing their reporting responsibility and authority short-selling, then that means the CAPM model becomes obsolete.  If the CAPM model services what EMH establishes, then I hope this all makes sense when I believe there is room to argue against EMH.",2

" Understanding the ""20 days to inform a public-employee of your intent to sue"" TL,DR? I'm uncertain ""When the clock starts"" for this ""20 day notification"", I read it somewhere but cannot find it now however it stated that public employees (at least here in FL) are to be notified within 20 days of your intent to sue.  I'm left puzzled and worried, because I don't have any concrete ""day of malpractice"", what happened to me occurred over nearly 3 dozen visits, as 3 of the staff dentists would take turns giving me exorbitantly oversized fillings (all of which are failed now, just 1yr later)  So I'm not even positive if my suit should be against the dentists (and their assistants?) who worked on me, as a 'group', or against the dental clinic itself.  Also since the work was done through most of 2021, there was no ""hard date"" of malpractice.How would you guys see this?  Any chance medical/dental stuff may be exempt from this 20 day thing?Thanks a lot for any help understanding this, I feel like I should be rushing but, at the same time, I am scared to let them know I have sought a 2nd-opinion, they think I'm VERY ignorant about just how bad things are, so *for now* since I don't have insurance and can't know if I'll find an attorney, I may need to be begging these same people ""Please re-check, I have a suspicion that 16 teeth you put fillings into are ALL infgected, every single one, can we get going on that?"" but that basically requires them acknowledging that all the work last year was pointless, I - and they - are ""between a rock & a hard place"" on this one (the clinic folk that I see *now* are not so bad, it was the first 2/3rds of treatment, when I was going to a closer location - where it was spanish-speaking and english as 2nd-language for clients only - I believe the damage was done, so to speak, by the time I finally requested to the administrator that I be moved to a facility where I can speak clearly with the dentist because the dentist that day had removed a tooth I did NOT expect (and it was a visible tooth when I smile....thought he was pulling the one beside it/rear of it, a tooth that was closer to molar area and also pulled shortly thereafter, but the miscommunication scared me.  Nevermind that, on multiple occasions, I'd sit down & the dentist would ask *ME* ""what do you wanna do today?"" and I'd have this bewildered look on my face like ""you're the professional, you know the plan you guys have me on for fillings + partials to cover what you can't filll, YOU should know which the next most-appropriate is!"" lol just insane!Unsure when the 20d could start, I mean I saw a private dentist for a 2nd opinion >20d ago, and subsequently setup a consultation with my dentist at the clinic (the one I was transferred to) wherein - if you can even believe this - he literally tells me he does NOT believe I have ANY chance of actually getting my partials....the partial dentures that he put me on the waiting-list for back in Nov., and had told me I was ready-for & just needed to come for my cleanings.... After seeing the private dentist & learning that every single filling (16!!) was bad, and that this compromised the requisite teeth for anchoring partials properly, I went into the consultation with my clinic-dentist expecting him to keep up his lies but was astounded when he basically tells me ""Yeah she   will never do your partials, she requires far too perfect of a mouth and the fillings you have preclude this"", now I was told this by the 2nd-opinion private dentist, but for my  clinic dentist to tell it to me was mind-boggling, I asked him ""Wait so, after waiting months on this waiting list, and finally getting called to go to that facility to get my partials, I would have been told an unequivocal No by the woman there?"" and he replies ""Yes""!!!!!  He furthermore tells me that all the composite filler that I'd gotten for about 95% of the time with this clinic was ""very soft, very short lived"", a few years lifespan but not even half-decade!!  I was astounded I had only gone in for a painful molar I had no idea I had cavities but figured ""get fillings when dentist advises"", did not think a year later that I'd b'e losing every tooth that they filled because their fillings all (100%) failed!!",1

"Can my boyfriend’s crazy mom ruin our ability to close on our new home? Bf and I recently started the process on closing on our first home together. We won’t be able to move to our home until August 5.Currently, we are renting from his mother. Bf has lived in this rental (3 bedroom farmhouse owned by her) since 2017. Their agreement was that he would pay the mortgage and she would let him live in the house until the mortgage was paid off and sign the deed over to him. When he and I started dating (2 years ago) all was well. I moved in last year and we had a baby. We have two older children as well from previous relationships.For clarification, his mother doesn’t live here. She lives with her boyfriend in a different place.Bf’s mother has always been a heavy drinker. She made a huge scene in front of the kids a few months ago while inebriated and put them in danger with her actions. We decided that we would cut her off from communication other than to tell her when we had dropped money off to her for the mortgage.  Meanwhile, we began to look for another place to live.We don’t let her see the kids because of what she has done and as a result of that, she has harassed us endlessly. Most recently, she has served us with court papers for an eviction hearing.She’s told my bf’s brother that she would drop the suit against us if we would let her see the children again.Is that even legal?

" work in small private clinic for 1 ye, just received my first 1:1which concerns were addressed but then received follow-up email inflating issues and not mentioning how the concerns were addressed. I'm an office manager for a private healthcare clinic. I've been there 1 year and on Friday just had my first 1:1 with one of the partners. She voiced the below three concerns which I addressed and/or offered solutions to. The conversation then changed to other topics as the partners keep canceling my meetings where I update them on things and ask for their feedback.ConcernsThere was one patient complaint against me in the year that I've been there. Unfortunately, the patient made a one star review about it (event occured late October but the patient made the review on 11/17/22) but the patients account of events were not accurate. I informed the owners what actually happened (I received wrong information then when the patient corrected me I seeked additional information from the clinical staff on a medical protocol as I don't have clinical background (I'm not an RN) and was able to resolve the issue) and one said ""you know how people are that post these reviews, you can't please them"". She said this because she herself, along with another owner have received one star reviews. When I've had to get information from them in order to do a patient recovery call 100% of the time the patients account is not accurate, as it doesn't match the documentation in the chart nor the Drs and nurses stories, the patient is usually upset about something else. I reiterated what occured (I had told them when they asked me on Thursday) she then said ""well, I had another patient, one of mine say you were rude, blunt when she was here last time"". She didn't provide any additional information except a description of the patient. I remembered this interaction because of the description. I was helping at the front desk because we were short staffed, during checkout I asked the patient if she could give me a minute to call her care team because her checkout slip had ""return in 4 weeks"" but it was crossed out and something else was circled. I explained this to the patient and informed her that i just wanted to call to make sure that she did not need to return I'm 4 weeks because I didn't want her to leave if she needed a follow-up appointment. I received the information, thanked her for waiting and completed the transaction. I informed the owner of this and she didn't say anything.Two late credit card payments. Due to being short staffed and unable to find candidates for the front desk, I was working full-time at the front desk from July to end of October. I was coming in early, staying late and working weekends just so I could catch up in my own work as office manager. In September and October I made a one day late credit card payment. I informed the owner that these are the only two times this has happened in the 1 year I've been there and the payments were made on a Saturday when I had come in to work considering I had been working full-time  at the front desk. I also informed her that it won't happen again as I've out things in place (I made myself reminders). She didn't say anything.Supply shortages. Due to previous workflows not working, the clinical staff was using up supplies (meds, vaccines, devices) until they were completely out and not following supply workflows, thus resulting in running out of needed supplies. Earlier this spring I implemented a new workflow and added labels on all the medical supplies, medications, vaccines and devices in red ink that say ""almost out! Time to reorder!"" When the staff get to one of these they're supposed to write it down on the supply request form that's available in the supply closet. Every week I order what's on the list. Well, some of the employees are not following the supply workflows and ignoring the labels, so about 3 (end of October) weeks ago we ran completely out of a medical device. I was at the front desk and the owners that were in clinic seeing patients were texting me ""what are you going to do?"". I went to them and they started questioning me why we ran out and I was honest and told them I didn't know we were out until one of the nurses told me the day before. I placed an order to be overnighted to us but the vendor shipped it ground instead. I called our rep to see if he had any medical devises he could drop off but he didn't, and there was nothing he could do to assist with expediting our order. I ended up calling another clinic and we borrowed the medical devise from them. To avoid this situation in the future I locked up all the extra medicine, vaccines and devices. I give the clinical staff what they need for their nurses stations and when they come to a red label they come to me and I give them more supplies from the locked inventory. This workflow has been working and we haven't ran out since this incident.I took the 9am 1:1 as constructive criticism and asked the owner to let me know if there's any other issues or patient complaints, as I'd like to know how I may remedy the situation(s). She agreed and thanked me for my time. I thought the meeting ended in a good note.Then at 4pm when I was in the middle of a whole clinic phone upgrade I received a meeting follow-up email from the owner. She cc'd the other partners and mentioned the above three concerns, however, she didn't mention how I addressed her concerns (didn't mention anything that I had said) and instead stated that there were ""multiple patient complaints"" and ""multiple late credit card payments"". She ended the email with ""If you need help resolving these issues or have any questions, please let me or one of the other physicians know.""I've been a healthcare office manager for 6 years and this is my first time working in private practice. In the 1 year I've been with my employer this is my first 1:1 and have never received an email like this (nor from my previous employers) and I'm now worried that they're gonna fire me. A part of me wants to reply as not everything addressed was in her email, or should I bring it up at the next meeting (if they don't cancel) or not do/say anything?ETA: it's a business of about 25 employees, I am the administrator for the clinic and the owners 2nd business of 5 employees. Besides the billing manager it's just me doing everything (HR, payroll, general business administration, etc.). Of note, I'm currently 24 weeks and due in March.",0

" Boss is bullying/berating me So I’m currently getting my masters and before the fall semester started I told my supervisor I had to do an internship for the fall in July.

And everything was good.There was a delay because of the onboarding process and I didn’t start until the end of September and my school was like here’s the start date. I was going to go in my first day and get my schedule and let my job know.Well my big boss got looped in and she kept pressing me about a schedule I didn’t have and ccd all the supervisors between our email correspondence and I was like it was on Tuesday and Wednesday.So I went for another meeting and she pretty much berated me about not knowing how to communicate and put in time off. Which I have email proof about putting in time off months in advance, and the email in July talking about my internship, and another email with information about the internship. And she was pretty much bullying me and yelling at me while my supervisor just sat there silently.Ever since that meeting my supervisor won’t talk to me unless my boss is on it, it was never like that before we were pretty good, and she just bullies me about taking sick leave when I have a doctors note stating otherwise or literally anything.Also there’s another person doing an internship at my job and they are working with her no problem.I am literally being targeted and bullied and idk if I should take it to HR and what to say.

" Fire me for situation at home? Edit: Thank you all so much for all the replies! As I don’t have much time right now, I’ll take this space to respond to all the messages. A big thank you for everyone who took the time to read and reply! I have read all of the messages and I take them really seriously. I really understand that my relationship is not healthy at this point and that I need to find a solution. I keep hoping on change tho, and in the meantime I try to figure out how ‘secure’ my job is when it’s known that my situation at home is difficult. Because sometimes I feel like I want to explain but I just can’t. If I would let HR know (at least the confidant, she works in HR team), would this be seen as a red flag, a possible (big) risk for the company and therefore better to ‘get rid of me’? I am trying to figure that out before I say something which I shouldn’t have. So I am gathering a lot of information about this and all the replies have been helpful. I’ll probably read them again tomorrow because a lot of useful things have been said!——————————————————I am really struggling with what would be the best thing to do at the moment. Posting from a throwaway account, as I obviously don’t want to use my normal account for this post.I have a really nice job where I have earned my position and all the respect from my colleagues. I am not really visible for my colleagues but my work definitely is. I perform beyond expectations and I also get complimented a lot. My job is not the easiest but I managed to get everything under control and keep things rolling. It’s an operational job so I can work from home and I fortunately don’t have a lot of meetings. That’s why I’m not really visible, only for my own team.The thing is, at home I have a lot of struggles. I keep work and private separate at all costs because I don’t want anyone to know what kind of troubles I sometimes have, especially in my relationship. My boyfriend actually doesn’t want me to work but he allows it. Lately he is really stressed and gets angry for the smallest things. Today he got incredibly mad because I was comforting a colleague through a call, she was stressed and I wanted to help her, which made my boyfriend mad, saying it wasn’t my job to comfort people and that I should not talk to anyone. No more calls. It’s really hard because he can be so unpredictable, sometimes he is really proud of how I do my job, and sometimes he hates that I have a job and wants me to quit. Right now it feels like a prison at home. I have some excuses in line to be able to skip the upcoming calls, I could get away with missing 2… 3 would be suspicious I guess but maybe by that time my boyfriend doesn’t bother anymore or isn’t even at home.No one in my company knows about my situation at home and I really want it to stay that way. Only one person from HR knows a little bit about it and she said I could always talk to her about it. However I am really scared to lose my job if I would tell how the situation at this moment is. They could see it as a risk and fire me, even tho I perform near perfectly.So my question is; is it a true possibility to get fired over this? What should I do? I feel a little bit lost at this moment because I don’t want to lose my job and I also don’t want to appear as a weak person.EDIT: Adding to this; I know my boyfriend doesn’t sound like the nicest guy right now but he is absolutely not always like this. Only just now he really sucks but I really love him and I also really don’t want to lose him!",0

" I’m being told by my employer that I can’t use my accrued 24 hours of paid sick time because I didn’t request to use the paid hours 120 hours in advance. Is this legal? I woke up sick yesterday morning, immediately called off because I had COVID like symptoms. I scheduled an urgent care appointment and it was determined that I don’t have COVID (but i am contagious for several days with a different illness) so I acquired a doctors note as proof.As soon as I got back home from my appointment, I scheduled the next two days off with my paid “sick time”.  Immediately a notification popped up saying this: “This was an emergency request since it was within 120 hours of your scheduled work date and time. You will receive an Unexcused absence unless you provide appropriate documentation”.I then contacted my employer to clarify. I asked them if they needed my note from the doctor to excuse my unexcused absences to which I was told: “We don't take doctor's notes so I will have to find that email template and audit it!”.  I was then told I need to delete the “sick” request and resubmit it as regular “time off” since it’s an unexcused absence.So now all three days I’m missing are going to be unexcused just because they don’t take drs notes apparently. This led me to ask: “So if i’m sick again in the future, it’s going to unexcused unless i request off paid sick time five days in advance?” to which my employer simply replied “Yes”.How is anyone suppose to know they’re going to be sick five days before they’re sick? So I’m just going to get unexcused absences every time i suddenly get sick? This doesn’t seem right at all and I desperately need to get paid the three days I’m missing.",0

" Is it typical for recruiters to ask you to provide your W2 before you interview? I had a recruiter at a firm (who seems employed by the firm, not a 3rd party recruiting firm) reach out to me last week about a role at their company.  I'm not actively looking for a role, but it seemed interesting, so I had a call with the recruiter last Friday.  We ended the call that I was interested in interviewing, and she thought I would be a good fit for the role.This week, we had some back and forth over email (and her email seems legit from the company) about scheduling an interview.  We settled on tomorrow at 11 am for the interview.Earlier today, she called me to confirm everything for tomorrow and ensured I got the zoom meeting invite.  Then she wanted to confirm my salary expectations because the hiring manager saw my resume and is interested in my background.  So I gave them to her, but she didn't react either way, so I assumed she was okay with my salary ask.I received a VM and an email from her late this afternoon asking for my latest W2 to confirm that I'm currently making within this salary range.  I thought that was an odd request because what I'm asking for is pretty standard for my type of role.  I'm an enterprise technical architect and if you go on salary.com what I'm asking for is within the typical salary range for my role.I responded to her email asking for more details about why she requires this information.Is this a typical/legit ask from a recruiter? I've been working for over 15 years at several companies and have only provided W2 if asked during the background check after accepting an offer.   I'm not comfortable emailing my W2 to a recruiter since it has such sensitive information.  I haven't interviewed in about 2 years and have been working at this company for 6, so maybe things have changed a bit since the pandemic?  I'm not sure would love some input from this forum.",0

"Does the ADA require a restaurant to let customers with medical needs to bring their own food? Our kid who has Celiac disease was invited to a birthday party at a restaurant that our family does not believe can safely provide a gluten-free meal that will not make him sick.With Celiac disease, even a small amount of gluten-containing ingredients or cross-contamination can make the person sick.Examples of unsafe foods would include: French fries made in the same fryer as breaded items, or anything made in a kitchen with wheat flour in the air (e.g. Pizza restaurants that make their own crust).

Unfortunately, I unknowingly bought the wrong type of ingredient (milk). The following day, said coworker (coworker, not manager or any superiority) came in and saw the wrong type of milk. I told her it was me and I didn't know because no one told me we needed a specific kind. Over the next few minutes she brought it up again and again, saying 'I shouldn't go if I don't know how', etc. At one point she rudely brought it up to me while I was on till taking an order from a customer. I had to answer her while still trying to maintain professional with the customer. The customer then said ""Well that's awkward..."" And seemed visibly uncomfortable.

" Boss consistently asks us to work through lunch. Alabama. Healthcare Admin/Communications/Internal Comms.I really enjoy my job, and I like all of my coworkers, including my boss. They all treat me and each other well.I’m not sure whether I should even complain about this at all, but I wanted to get a consensus of what was normal.For some context, when I was recruited for this job, the recruiter gave me a certain hourly rate. When I actually started, my boss was confused when I asked where and how to clock in/out. Apparently they had requested I be on salary, like everyone else in my department. So I was put on salary. My paycheck is the same as it would have been if I worked 40 hours a week on the original hourly rate.However, my gripe is that my boss is asking me (and my coworkers) to work during lunch fairly often. It usually isn’t the entire lunch, but 3 days out of 5, we only actually get to eat about 30 minutes of the hour we were told we’d get.I make a pretty decent amount of money per hour, and just wondered if it was wrong for me to feel like I’m getting gypped.

" Employer using inaccurate hours to offset inaccurate pay rate. I'm new to this community but hope I'm in the right spot. I work on call in addition to my salaried position. My call back (when I am called in to work) rate was mistakenly changed to $1 per hour in the system so my (thousands of employees) employer has simply been using inaccurate hours to offset the inaccurate pay rate to result in accurate pay per pay period.

" Insubordination? Are there grounds for termination? I worked in a call center for a Fortune 500 company from June 2016 to April 2022. Suffice to say, after nearly 6 years, my patience had run its course and I was yearning for a change in roles that would take me off the phones and allow me to work at a more comfortable, less stressful pace. In April, I transitioned into a more ""behind the scenes"" role with the company and have been quite happy in this new role and can see it as a path for advancement to bigger and better things moving forward.The problem, however, is that our call center has been struggling with heightened volumes for the better part of the past year or more and our call center management team has resorted to pulling back people who previously worked in the call center to provide temporary help. In the 6 months I've been in my new role, I have been ""volun-told"" to return to the call center on 3 separate occasions. The first time was for one week, the second time was to help with a busy Monday, and just the other day I was informed it will be over the course of the next two weeks for a total of four days. There's a good chance there will be more to come until the call center hires more people.The way that the request is being brought to us doesn't really give us the option to say no, hence the use of ""volun-told"" to describe the situation. It's usually presented by my manager as, ""Unfortunately, call center leadership let me know the call center has been struggling with volumes and they're gonna need you guys to help them out for  .""I've previously had discussions with my new manager about my thoughts on the matter and I feel somewhat guilty because the impression I've received is that my manager is basically just passing the message from call center management to those of us being asked to help. He sounds like he really doesn't want to have to deliver this news and that it pains him to have to break it to us. The response my manager has given each time I've mentioned how I feel about it is basically, ""I hear you. Hopefully, this is the last time.""I've explained to my manager that one of the reasons for wanting to move into this new role is that I believe it better suits my skillset and I feel as though I can do better work in a significantly less stressful environment. While working in the call center (especially early/mid- and post-pandemic), my mental health took a nosedive and I was constantly stressed out and anxious. You always got a ""We care about you and appreciate everything you're doing....but work faster"" type of feeling from call center leadership.I should also mention that I work for a company that encourages advancement and does not believe in holding people back from moving on. The call center is kind of like the entry-level golden ticket that allows you to do so. When I left the call center in April, I did feel a little bad because I was part of a somewhat large exodus of people who had posted out in order to move on to other jobs while the call center was still struggling. My call center manager knew that I was growing weary of my job there and that I had the desire to move on, so he was thrilled for me once this new job came along and made it clear that there were no hard feelings, despite how busy the call center was. It was always a message like, ""This is our problem. Don't let it stop you from moving on. You don't owe us anything.""The issue that I have is that the job description in my new role mentions nothing about providing call center phone support as needed. My department provides written correspondence for requests that the call center cannot provide verbally to callers at point of call, so there is still a connection to the call center in the sense that these requests are submitted by the call center to my department. However, now that I've transitioned into my new role and am no longer working in the call center, I don't believe it's my problem that they may be struggling to keep up with the volume of calls. I hate to be that person because it's in my nature to be helpful and I have a hard time saying no, but I don't think I'll ever truly be able to get my point across unless I put my foot down and refuse a request like this the next time this comes up. I know that the call center is just doing this with me and my colleagues because we only recently left that area and have retained a usable base of knowledge. They are not asking those who have been out of the call center for a while (but previously worked there) to help out in the same way.I have a scheduled meeting with my new manager next month, in which I was planning to address this again. My question is, if another ""volun-tolding"" comes up in the future, am I within my right as a non-call center employee at this point to refuse the request, or could this be interpreted as insubordination and a reason for my employment to be terminated?",0

"CT/RI/Narragansett Tribe Child Custody All Names changed but: Okay so the gist is my mom Beth has a husband John.

Anna had the baby taken away because of a drug issue.

" Disciplinary write up, boss is out of pocket?? Asking for a friend.My friend is a Leasing Manager at an apartment complex, they're in charge of outreach, oversight of leases old and new, event planning, and some management. My friend reports to a General Manager who was hired there about two weeks prior to my friend -- the LM. This GM employs an all around annoying, moody, haughty, yet aloof management style. (A new employee nicknamed GM Cruella) Since the beginning of my friend's tenure there, it has been discovered through encounters at work that GM goes through these moods that have a tendency to disrupt the otherwise pleasant and peaceful work environment. GMs passive aggressive behavior and fake attitude even caused a former maintenance man to quit.GM pretends to care about creating a positive and cohesive work environment but is not responsive to requests for assistance, is never particularly helpful when approached for help, and has a tendency to act like a bully to LM and others for asking constructive questions. Once LM tried to reach out to a different department for help which GM encouraged previously and consequently scolded LM for requesting help. Other employees have brought issues of  'moods' and hypocrisy up to GM directly only for GM to disregard, act confused, or attribute the mood to their having RBF. (We suspect The GM being prescribed benzodiazepine drugs could have a role to play)LM started their job with an excited attitude and worked to improve the work environment and culture there because it suffered from some pretty heavy disorganization before their employment started. This excited motivation eventually devolved into a frustrated and tired attitude which can fluctuate as often as the moods of the GM apparently do. LM does their best to tune out the negativity but the morale of the staff suffers due to the unpleasant vibe GM carries around and it has gotten to the point where majority of the staff besides one that attaches themselves closely to the GM can agree the environment has become a real drag because of GM. Despite the sour work environment the disorder from before was changed greatly and there's now a healthy number of residents being catered to at the complex. LM has played a significant role in improving said work environment. LM and GM have clashed in the past due to claims from GM that LM has not performed up to par in the past but the claims are bordering on nitpicking at this point.Today GM put together a disciplinary write up for LM and invited a Regional Director to the meeting to discuss improving LMs 'unsatisfactory performance' and it is written on the basis of maybe 1 half true complaint out of 10 at best: -Goals that were never clearly established because of a lack of communication from GM to LM -GM claimed to have to remind LM of a task twice when in fact GM reminded LM once (a week later) -GM complains of not being notified of a certain payment protocol LM authorized -GM claims there is excessive ""hanging out"" in the office, when there is no shortage of GM chatting it up with their favorite employee during sidekicks entire shift regularly -Even more ridiculous claims that aren't even worth typing outSome of GMs proposed solutions include LM adopting ambiguous practices that suit GM better personally and LM and myself find are actually unnecessary, others set goals that seem to be regressive in nature and others provide LM do things they are already doing. LM refused to sign the write up and told GM & RD that some of these claims are certainly not based in fact.",0

" Museum Department Director Reaches out I was offered a position at a very well known nationally accredited museum. We are in the negotiation faze and I was offered well below what HR got back to me with. After I told the recruiter I would be comfortable with 3k more than my initial offer (the max of the listed salary range). I did some research and realized that I'm leaving so much money on the table, so I want to re-ask today for 5k-10k more than the max for the position. There also isn't any savings in place in the offer I received (I asked about this and how it can be implemented or if they have discarded this from their packages), I've read about some horror stories of people's offers being rescinded just because they asked for a living wage and am afraid of that outcome, what should I do? The Director of the department emailed me this morning too instead of the recruiter to talk if I wanted to. Is this a good or a bad sign? I really want this job, but I don't want to be struggling because of inflation, rising costs of living, or this recession we're in. I do think they really want me to join, I want to keep the offer on the table though.Edit: I did accept the offer with the initial ask which was for the full range offered. Thanks so much for everyone's help!",0
" Is There ANY Way This Isn’t Sabotage by My Employer? Y’all… I think I just busted my company deleting emails and setting me up.I am asking you fine folks the probability that this company is indeed this dumb, and if NOT, what other scenario could explain the circumstances?   I’m only going to put forth the relevant facts to keep it simple…I have been engaging with my employer & HR on a complex issue most of the year. It got to a point a few months ago where both of us needed to consult w/ legal persons essentially to ensure everything was above board. This resulted in me filing a complaint with a governmental agency, which is being “reviewed”.This is not anything I am “at fault” for, meaning I didn’t violate the terms of my employment or need disciplinary action.   I have remained in contact with HR and been transparent & responded to every communication and request. I have not involved any legal counsel as I have not needed to take that step. I do have a lawyer advising me until there is true need for them to intervene.Today I received notice from the HR person I’ve been dealing with that they did not receive a requested communication & update from me and as a result needed to take action since I “didn’t comply”.  I did, in fact, comply, and immediately panicked that “something” had gone wrong and my email wasn’t sent or perhaps I thought I did but only saved a draft. It was nowhere to be found on my company email. It wasn’t even in the special archive folder I had set up for HR correspondence in which I saved EVERYTHING.Thanks to my diligence in record keeping, and as a CYA Master, I have a printed copy of that email. I was relieved to also find a digital copy in an online database, like a “cloud” if you will, in which our company emails are archived for 5+ years, even if deleted from Outlook. I use it often because most items are set to automatically delete at periods set by the company that we cannot change. For example, anything in the deleted folder gets “deleted-deleted” after 14 days, items in the sent folder after 6 weeks, etc. unless we specifically set a rule for an email or folder to retain it. I do know that this “cloud” database is not widely known among employees, because often I will procure something thought to be lost and asked how I found it, and then am told “wow- I didn’t know we had that”.The email is in this archive. In the properties I see time stamps of when it was sent and received.I have no explanation as to how only this email disappeared from my sent folder AND the folder I saved it to. All emails before and after this one sent that day remain.   I am trying to remain optimistic that this isn’t something nefarious. This is a very large organization, federally regulated in fact, and I can’t comprehend the reasoning for this email to disappear while they’re being investigated? Does HR not realize we have this archive? What should I do? I’m in shock.",0

"Colorado Tenant Laws- Breaking lease Hi all,I will try to keep this simple and state the facts. We (my boyfriend and I) moved from Texas to Colorado Springs in May, I'm not familiar with Colorado rental laws and I'm having trouble finding someone who can help us answer our questions.Facts:We are purchasing a home and closing on the 18th of this month. Our neighborhood is getting a lot more crime. Our cars have been egged, windows have been smashed on a bunch of cars on our street, gun shots on the street behind us outside our house.We are breaking our lease which I understand has penalties. Our landlord is saying we forfeit our security deposit ($2100) and will owe him for Decembers rent. (I've attached a snipped from our lease about what it says for the security deposit) He is saying we have to be out by end of NovemberHe is having someone move in on December 1st, but is having is pay Decembers rent as a ""penalty"" for breaking the lease. There is absolutely nothing about penalties for breaking it written in our lease.From what I have gathered, he can keep our security deposit (or part of it) to pay for rent until a new tenant moves in (or just charge us that rent amount). I can't find anything that says he can legally keep it just for breaking the lease.Then also, he is trying to charge us Decembers rent (while making us leave by the end of November) and having someone start their lease December 1st. I thought that was illegal.My question(s) I guess are what is he allowed to charge us if nothing is written in our lease and can he double-dip on rent like that?I have already tried to talk to him about not paying Decembers rent and he immediately threatened to not find a new tenant for a few months so we would have to pay even more rent. He isn't budging on keeping our security deposit/ charging us another months rent. I would just pay it then sue him if my findings are correct and he cant keep/charge us either of those.Thank you in advance",1
" Can my manager force me to stay after they close? For reference, I’m an assistant at a hair salon. I answer phones, make appointments, wash hair for the stylists, sweep the hair, stock shelves etc. The on Wednesdays they close at 8 and Saturdays they close at 4. On Wednesday, they still had two clients sitting with color on their heads at 7:20, after they had closed. Mind you it takes at least 20 mins to apply the color, then they sit with it on for at least 30 mins and washing it out takes 15-20 mins, then we still have to clean up and take out the trash which takes 20-30 mins. There’s 3 stylists and myself who work there. Today, Saturday, a woman was still in the salon waiting to get a haircut at 3:30 and the stylist hadn’t even started yet, by the time I left which was almost an hour after my shift was over, she had still had a half a head to do. The other two stylists were also still there. I’m cleaning up my share and leaving when my shift is supposed to end, regardless if there’s still clients in the salon. I’m just an assistant, there’s no need for me to be there if theres two people left.  I’m fairly new to the salon so I don’t wanna say anything yet. I have other commitments after work and I’m not getting paid overtime. Should I say something or just deal with it, at least for now?",0

"Exercising vs Selling to Close Everything online says, for call options, it's almost always better to sell the contract than to exercise it, then resale the shares. This is, among other things, because you're out the premium if you exercise then sell. However, is it not possible that the stock price can go up more than the option price, relatively speaking, so that the profit you get from exercising then selling actually exceeds the profit you would get from selling to close?Example: I buy a contract  for 1.00 with a strike price of 5.00. Then, the stock price goes up to 7.50 while the contract price goes up to 2.00. If I sell the contract, I  profit 1.00 per share. If I exercise it,  I profit 2.50 per share, less 1.00 for the contract price, so a net profit of 1.50 per share. I profit 0.50 more per share by exercising+selling shares than I do by selling the contract itself. How often does this happen?I'm having a hard time finding information online about how option prices tend to trend with stock prices. I don't know if anything like my above example actually ever happens, or if option prices always increase in proportion to stock prices. I know what ""delta"" tracks, and it's related to my question, but doesn't actually answer it.To clarify, I already know about other advantages in selling to close, like not actually having to buy the shares. I'm not talking about those things. I just want to know how often, if ever, the stock price increase is so much in excess over the option price that you make more money exercising than selling the contract.",2
" Can a medical procedure not be covered under employer provided insurance if the original injury occurred before coverage? Can medical procedure be denied by employer insurance if it was from injury prior to insurance coverage?Hello!

It is nearing the end of the year and because I don’t want to repay my deductible and OOP max again in a few weeks, I’m waiting until January to have the surgery. I’m signing up for my companies insurance again for the new year and am opting for the lower deductible coverage since I know I’ll be needing the surgery asap once January hits. (Already risking it by delaying two months)Can the insurance deny coverage since it was from the previous year?

We are aware that you have registered the domain name  <Company Amail.com> and we’re contacting you to secure the transfer of that domain to Company A, the rightful  owner.In addition to the extensive goodwill the Company A brand has acquired, Company A owns multiple relevant  trademark registrations for the Company A trademark, including:(a) U.S. Trademark Reg.

We believe the current circumstances lead to the conclusion that the Domain Name has been registered in bad  faith pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (""UDRP""), adopted by  the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (""ICANN"") which provides, in part, that bad faith  registration arises when: ""by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to  your web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to  the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on  your web site or location.” See, UDRP, Para. 4(b)(iv) Company A prefers to handle this matter quickly and amicably without the need for adversarial proceedings.

"My estranged, mentally ill father committed suicide but before he died, his wife convinced him to change his will to remove both of his biological children and leave everything to his wife. Can we fight this? My father committed suicide recently. He was and had been mentally ill for the last 20 to 25 years. He was unable to work and unable to care for himself on most days. When my sibling and I were young, he divorced my mother and married a woman with a small child and promised everything to her and her child if she took care of him. I don't know how much money was ultimately given to my father from his own father's estate but it was in the millions. I'd guess like 1-3 or something like that. My father had tried to convince me to drop out of college to care for him and when I refused, he cut me out of his life. My sibling was cut out of his life soon afterwards. He was a nightmare to deal with after he became ill, he only cared for himself and would willingly bring everyone else down around him. I remember the good times from before he got sick, moreso than my sibling does. They were younger and can only remember pain and suffering so they are only feeling anger now that we were completely removed from the will on top of the abandonment and pain we have already suffered at his hands. I haven't seen the will but my father's wife told us that ""they removed us from the will a few years ago"". Again, we had not spoken to these people for 15+ years because our father stopped speaking to us and changed his contact information. We thought he hated us and it seems like he didn't give too much of a shit about us, in whatever mental capacity he possessed. I'm sure the wife had something to do with having us removed, my father wouldn't have completed such a task on his own. Regardless, I'm not the one who wants to fight for this money. I feel like his entire family let us down and I don't need the money but then I've got a job and don't really consider myself to need or want too much, it is tainted and I'd be OK without it. But my sibling is adamant that we try to see if we can get our fair share somehow. The will would have been changed after my father was on social security disability for his mental illness. Can someone who is mentally ill really be allowed to change their will on their own? And if his wife did it, is that legal!? Does she need to provide proof of some kind that she could make such a change for him? My ultimate question is.. does my sibling have any chance here to recover some of the inheritance? Or is this just a waste of time. I personally am not getting involved or trying to chase lawyers down or emotionally fatigue myself. But I will stand by my sibling in their decision if it requires my cooperation somehow. My sibling did briefly speak to some attorney and they did say we might have a chance but would need to pay a retainer fee of like $1500 to start something.. I just worry this is a waste of their time and energy. I don't want them fighting in courts for years and years. That seems like such a lose-lose scenario.

"Noob question about options and strike prices, should I keep it as close as possible to the current value? Hello, I have a question about strike prices and purchasing options, do you generally want to keep the value of the strike price as close as possible to the current value? Like if I want to buy a call contract on nok, which is currently 4.64. I would want an option at 4.7, rather than an option at 5?When I purchase an option I notice that the price of a contract on gme is significantly more than a price at nok. A nok contract is $1 and a gme contract is $2,500, why? Is it because of volatility?Do you use buy to close on calls? and sell to close on puts?Thanks in advance.",2
"Working Capital Accounting Questions - Profit and Cash I know to get cash from operations we essentially need to take our net profit, add back in changes in working capital alongside our depreciation expense. What I can't understand is how it works?Let's say last year I had £100,000 in trade receivables. This year I have a really good year, making a profit of £2m with £300,000 in trade receivables. I'd have to deduct £200,000, because of this profit, I'm still waiting to collect £200,000 of it. Is that correct?Similarly with stock, if my stock position went down this year, won't this be accounted for in my Cost of Goods Sold - I can understand why an increase in stock will lead to a cash outflow, because we would need to add back in unsold inventory we bought that year, but when stock goes down would this not be stock that has been sold and expressed in our COGS expense already. How does a decrease add to an inflow if a decrease would be it getting sold?Finally trade creditors (accounts payable), if this goes down then we end up with an outflow. Is this suggesting we've incurred greater cash expense than what's listed on the P/L because we've now had to pay down what we owed from the last accounting year, and what we owe this year is less? Say if we went from £10m to £6m in creditors, that would be a cash payment of £4m from last period to this period, and so as a result we would have to add £4m more onto our cash expenses as a result of paying - ""of the expenses listed on our P/L, we have incurred £4m more as a result of a reduction in our creditors as we've now had to put £4m more into our working capital cycle""?I'm trying to really understand the logic here. Is it essentially not classed as an expense because all it is is adding more cash to our working capital - more debtors, less creditors and more stock wouldn't necessarily get classed in P/L expenses as these costs are working capital - it's something we'll get back, as it's cash tied up in the business, but as they change they either use up more cash or generate more cash depending on how well we manage our working capital?",2

" Colleague has been calling me 'pretty boy/princess' among other things for 4 months. How best to deal with this?   For the last 4-5 months a team member (fork lift driver) at work has exclusively referred to me (27m,)  as 'pretty boy', 'princess', and another borderline homophobic remark.Initially, I accepted it as a joke/banter. However, of late it has become increasingly malicious in tone, and the chronic nature of his remarks is beginning to annoy me. I can feel it begin to hit a bottleneck.Yesterday, I was in our warehouse dock, whilst there was a forklift around. I communicated with the driver to confirm it was safe for me to pass with my pallet jack/pallet. Driver (different colleague) said it was all good for me to move my pallet. This other guy interjects saying 'wait your turn, you f'ing pretty boy'.I've documented a couple of interactions like this in my phone, and will continue to do so. Considering reporting to management, or just dealing with the guy myself.To make sure I'm not misinterpreting his words and reacting disproportionately to the situation, is the general consensus that these words would be perceived as an insult? Especially in the context of coming from a middle aged male co-worker. Cheers",0
"Can someone end up charged with kidnapping for rescuing an unconscious person and is there statutory or case law on this especially in the US? Suppose someone comes across someone who is unconscious but appears to be in trouble in a way where if you just left them there they could get hurt or even die. Maybe they are asleep outside and it's freezing out or there is a storm or even a tornado or even just the expectation of dangerous weather. Or what about if the person is in an area you think of as dangerous or risky to be in because of for example, crime?You try to wake them up but can't. You assume they would want to be rescued and you try to get them somewhere safer. A hospital if possible but maybe there is not one nearby or there is an ongoing natural disaster preventing you from getting them there.On the face of it a charge of kidnapping in this scenario seems insane but it's conceivable since you are technically moving a person without their consent. Has this ever been argued in a court of law and what was the outcome? Are there any statutes to provide a defense in these cases?",1

"Pseudo demotion (not performance related) - ask for severance?  This is a question for my sister, that I provided her advice on, to check if my advice is totally off the wall or if askHr agrees.She has been at her current company for just over 3 years. She went out on a medical leave, earlier this year but has been back at work for several months. She had positive to neutral performance reviews prior and no feedback since returning. All of a sudden her boss told her they are hiring a new role above her to basically do the strategic parts of her current job. She is keeping her director title and pay but will be working on the more day to day operational pieces. Her issue is that she liked the strategic parts better, and feels the day to day operational is more mundane and typically a lower level position.She has had multiple discussions with her boss trying to understand rationale but is just told that it’s not performance related, and job responsibilities can change at any time. It sounds fishy to me that this was after her medical leave.She’s ready to jump ship as a result but I think she should first talk to her boss again, share that it feels like a significant part of her job was taken away as discrimination for the medical leave, and ask if they’d consider a severance. (Ie making them think she’d file suit otherwise)She thinks I’m crazy, that she has no ground since her position and pay didn’t change. Is that really the bar?Update- thanks for your responses. I will let my sister know she wins this argument! 🤦🏻‍♀️",0

" (GA) - LCSW/Inpatient Geriatric Psychology Provider now being asked to complete intake and billing functions without pay. Background: I work for a company that provides inpatient psychiatric services to SNF (nursing home) patients. Basically, if a patient is admitted to a SNF on any psychotropic med, the facility refers them to us for medication management and psychotherapy. I am an LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker) in GA. I see patients in 9 different SNF's. I usually complete an initial diagnostic evaluation (CPT: 90791), create a note, and am then paid a fee-for-service rate for the encounter. The company does all the credentialing, billing, intake, consents, assignment of benefits, and PR. If I feel as though the patient needs ongoing services, I will put them on my caseload and then bill out 90834, 90837, and 90832 - whichever is appropriate for subsequent encounters.Past operating procedure (prior to today): The SNF would identify a patient who needed our services. The facility would complete a consent either with the patient or w/ family if patient is cognitively impaired. The facility would also get an ""assignment of benefits"" (AOB) signed by patient/family indicating that we could bill insurance for the provider's (my) services - usually Medicare. I also have an ""admin time"" billing code where the company pays me about half of my hourly rate for administrative duties outside of seeing patients.Last week, the company laid off approximately 70 employees - mostly from intake / authorization team. There was a mandatory (unpaid) Zoom call today. We (providers) learned:The previous intake team was not loading the consents      and AOB to the patients file.This revelation was the result of an audit.We (the providers) are now required to go back to every      single patient on our caseload and get a new consent/AOB (even if they      recently signed one, but wasn't loaded).We will be locked out from opening notes (and being      able to see/bill patients) unless we go back and get all consents/AOB's      re-signed.We will not be paid any administrative time for      completing this task which was not our responsibility until today.My estimate is that this will be about 75-100 hrs of      work over the course of 6-8 weeks considering my frequency of patient      visits and difficulty in obtaining consents.Additional Information:- On my job description, under FLSA Status is states ""W2-employed Fee-For-Service"". I don't know if this means that I am exempt or non-exempt from FLSA. It's not listed on my paycheck.",0
"Selling Assets Preemptively to Avoid Upcoming Legal Judgment - How Can I Stop It? Hi folks. I'm in civil litigation with another party regarding fraud and other misrepresentations performed by the other party. We (my attorney and I) have pretty damning evidence proving the other person's wrongdoing, along with recorded proof that he has committed perjury throughout the lawsuit and in his deposition. All in all I think we have about as strong a legal case (along with strong evidence to back it up) as anyone could ask for, and my chances of winning the case are probably very high.Now as part of the Discovery process we have had to share our evidences, and the other party now knows that I have them on record lying about everything and committing perjury...and they surely realize that their chances of winning the lawsuit are very low. This person has a history of shady and illegal activity, but this is the first time they have actually been caught in the act.The challenge I have now, is that given the shady history of him and his family, how can I prevent the other party from selling off their assets (home, etc) such that they would become judgment proof? The trial was already supposed to have taken place, but with the backlog of cases due to Covid they were able to get a continuance to push it back yet another 8 months (the case has been outstanding for over 2 years already). Since they now know how strong the case is against them, I suspect they will be spending these 8 months trying to sell off their assets.So my question is: What can be done to prevent someone from being able to sell off assets preemptively, and become judgment proof? My understanding is that I can't file to put a lien on their property, as doing so prior to having a court order/judgement would be illegal.Any thoughts/suggestions?

" Am I allowed to have a 3rd party witness during my meeting tomorrow? Hi all, I could really use some help before I go into work tomorrow. To make a long story short, my boss would like to meet with me to try to steamroll, for a third time now, working two Sundays from now during the am shift. I don't work Sundays period- I haven't in 7 years and she knew this before she hired me, along with the fact that I wear skirts period. I attend church faithfully, and she's respected it up until now. I requested off and RSVP'd for a close friend's wedding months ago and, due to a combination of extenuating circumstances and poor planning, she's saying I can't get it off unless I agree to work Sunday.The problem is, with how she responded to my text reply to her (I said I would think about it), I do not feel even remotely comfortable sitting in a meeting with just her with how hostile she was. I was shaking after the exchange was over, partially because she said she didn't want to discuss this over text, sent two more messages, and then tried to call me. All while I was on the clock (I sent the initial answer on my break). By Illinois state or federal law, aren't I allowed to have a neutral third party witness for this meeting? Unfortunately Illinois is NOT a one party consent state, so I could get in hot water for recording the exchange, which is why I want someone else in there with me. I tried to compromise with her by saying I would work a full shift that Thursday already (my other regular day off) no problem, but she tried to say that Thursday would be overtime because, ""You will be working Sunday, if you want the wedding off. I don't know what else to tell you."" Another big reason I want a witness or, if I'm mistaken about laws a recording, is because I'm worried it's going to be a he-said, she-said argument if she tries to retaliate over this. She's already made at least 2 blatently discriminatory comments in the text exchange, and I'd like to be able to document whatever else she says in the heat of our ""discussion"" tomorrow.",0

" Can an employees inability to take part in social situations be officially be used against them? I am an Autistic mid-career level manager at a startup company. HR and management are not aware of my neurodiversity since per local regulations, I am not required to disclose it unless it directly impacts my objective job performance, which it doesn’t.My role requires that I travel with other team members to attend events, seminars and conferences, among other duties. I have no trouble whatsoever carrying out professional duties expected of someone in my role - I go above and beyond to offer the best possible service and generally obtain positive feedback.During these industry events and travels, however, employees are expected to stick together and participate in all kinds of social events that while not mandatory by any means, appear to be an important part of company and industry culture; like lunch together, dinner together, drinks together, etc. Since local culture puts strong emphasis on personal connections, such events open doors and might act as the primary building blocks of your reputation as a professional (which sometimes outweighs your actual performance on the job - eg. personality can trump skill and output).Largely due to my ASD, I cannot take part in such events, as much as I would like to. I simply have no energy left at the end of a long day at an industry show to do any more socialising off-the-clock, my social fuel being absolutely dry after 8 hours of on-the-clock talking to potential clients. I have tried in the past, but the result was either terrible migraines, skin rashes or a stomach ulcer.

This has caused my team to treat me different, and I know there is gossip and speculation about my personality and lifestyle.

" How Can I Leverage This into a Severance Package? Can anyone show examples in writing? Hi all,Long story short, I'm a black director working under a middle eastern executive in a large nonprofit. I have experienced an outrageous amount of disrespect from white people of all salaries and titles while working at this company but after speaking with my boss about it (the first time) he tried telling me “Sometimes they do it to me"" to make me feel like the disrespect and micro-aggression I was getting was okay. His advice the second and third times was to keep my distance and try to stay professional. I thought was weird advice given the nonprofit being all about diversity in their office décor and on their website, but I just kept on pushing through because it’s a six-figure job and I’m not above taking money from racists. However, given my past experiences with racism, I knew to keep documenting and saving emails.Here comes the funny part, last month my boss tried to make me drive 50 miles out of the way just to meet him in a random office, and when I told him I couldn’t do it he threatened me with HR but had them contact me to “check-in”.I thought it was a coincidence, but they told me that they were hearing from my colleagues that I was feeling burned out. I knew it was my boss going to them because he literally told me not to talk to anyone. The kicker is that I work in compliance, and his reasoning for telling me to avoid venting or discussing workplace issues with anyone from work is he would hate for me to substantiate anything false that I hear from other employees (aka racism that I hear from other employees would probably be believed quicker if they are heard by a black compliance director than the complainants' direct supervisor, and he can’t have any of his white VP buddies getting caught up)This random HR check-in was weird because I never had a negative remark or any complaints made about me. Anyway, when the day of the 1on1 meeting comes up I bring in my 60+ emails including positive ones that show me going hard to get shit done and receiving compliments from my boss and many others. I explain to them everything and all that I’ve seen they seem shocked but take all these notes and tell me they must do an investigation.So today after about a week they tell me the investigation is pretty much still going but they’d like to do peer mediation where there is a sit-down with me and my boss. I thought this was weird because they didn’t give me anything in writing. It was weird but I let them talk and they set us up to meet on December 1st.My nonprofit is large so there are a few offices throughout NY so I’m guessing my boss will avoid me until then. In the meantime, to prep for the big sit-down, I have copied the pages of the employee handbook regarding the complaint process and code of conduct.

" should I get bank holidays back in lieu if I’m on emergency standby on the day? Employed in England. Bank holidays make up part of my holiday entitlement (20 days + bank holidays).As part of my job I do out of hours emergency callout for a week at a time. We get paid a retainer for being on stand-by for the week then time and half / double time on top if we get called depending of time of day. This in itself I have no issue with and quite enjoy it if anything however I am butting heads with my employer over what happens if i’m on call over a bank holiday. Being on call is restrictive - I have to be ready to respond whenever I’m called meaning I cannot go too far from home/my area, I cannot go for a long walks or bike ride, drink, go out to dinner etc.So bearing that in mind, in the event I’m on standby over a bank holiday, I cannot do as I please due to work commitment/requirements and so I’m my opinion regardless of whether I get called out on said bank holiday, I am still technically working and should either have the day paid as a regular work day or get the day back in lieu. My employer on the other hand claims I am not working and should not get the day back in lieu as call-outs are ‘unscheduled’ works and so do not apply to the normal working time directive.Keen to hear what your opinions on the matter is.

" Asked for a raise, got a retention bonus. How should I feel? I was promoted to manager-level at my company about 6 months ago, and since, I’ve literally had 4 bosses (VP level) leave the company. I’ve weathered the storm and have taken on a significant amount of their responsibilities - the company leadership has routinely noted that I’ve “stepped up and taken on a lot” and I’ve gotten consistent strong performance reviews.Since I’ve taken on so much responsibility (the bosses roles were never backfilled) and have had visibility with leadership, I decided to ask for a 15% pay raise.

"The Different Types of Traffic Tickets Traffic citations are customarily divided into moving and non-moving violations. Those infractions involving vehicles in transit (moving violations) are generally the more serious offenses.Moving violations. Moving violations include a wide range of acts, including speeding, reckless driving, driving while intoxicated (DWI), driving under the influence (DUI), illegal lane changes, failure to stop at a red light or traffic sign, and operating a vehicle without valid license or insurance.Non-moving violations. This category includes parking violations, issues with paperwork (e.g. expired inspection tags), and problems with the car itself (e.g. a broken taillight).",1

"broker landlord Landlord was ordered by the city to do maintenance via rental inspection and service letter. He waited until the last week of the notice to turn up(yesterday), and his behavior has become increasingly erratic. He's broken into our home several times to try to access the electrical box in the garage(fire authority has told him he needs an electrician due to several code updates behind) He's scared my kids by showing up unannounced. Come back after he was allowed to work for 7hrs that day. Broke into a locked door and came inside with my kids here, he knew they were set to be alone for a gap before my s/o got home. We cooperate for maintenance whenever we have an appointment. Our rent has been paid on time for 4 years. No missed during pandemic etc. His partner has been trying to reel him in, but it's getting ridiculous. He purposely demolished the outer wall directly before it rained etc. I've contacted police any time he's broken in physically, but they say its his to break. They won't even take a proper report because legally tenants are dogs. Nobody cares if you kick your dog, you're just a jerk. I applied for a tpo and tied his hands via email. His maintenance person misrepresented themselves as a licensed plumber and then as a realty broker (he is neither, though he was once a broker) and tried to solicit me for matienence I was already owed. I asked him not to return. He ran pitential buyers through posing as maintenance. I now check all credentials. He sent two people over to bang on the walls and front door. When I asked why they said my doorbell didn't work and they needed on the roof. Just..generally nonsense harassment. No notice, no actual work just tearing things apart. I've kept all appointments with the other owner. An appointment showed up today (legal mitigation company hired by landlord) and confirmed existence of potential friable asbestos underneath our carpet. Mold intrusion, etc. Landlord has refused an epa certified test thus far, though he did come punch 5 holes in the kitchen ceiling in the one place without popcorn ceiling. Maintenance letter from the city had 47 habitability items. He had told us a mitigation had been done. We were helping him update failing fixtures etc as he'd offered to roll it into a mortgage initially. Home was built in 1973. Has had tenants full time since 92. We stopped all work once potential asbestos was found in ceiling, attic, and under carpeting (whole of house spare bathrooms and kitchen, 1860 sq ft) To boot I found out during the course of due dilligence that potentially he's involved in mortgage fraud with his maintenance man? Partner? etc...it's a much deeper hole than I really wanted to dig in. Id rather walk away from this property. Landlord is also a realty broker. First and foremost I'm out at the end of my lease (aug 7th) new housing already secured etc. Family has had health issues since they replaced the carpeting...odd interaction with the carpet guys I can't shake. Inspections have proved him negligent but..unsure how to proceed. There is... so much more than I had anticipated. Video of all interactions since letter was sent etc.  Epa has contacted him directly etc. His own contractor was here Monday and confirmed mold, potential asbestos both above in attic and ceilings and below the flooring underneath carpet. CREC violations abound...In Colorado.  Currently the mold is increasing due to hold up on testing. I'm familiar with tenant law and city code etc. Looking for someone familiar with realty law in CO.

 How can parental leave be used? Current DoD federal employee that has signed agreement with my supervisor and agency to use 12 weeks of paid parental leave intermittently after our child was born.

We are planning to travel as a family and I’d like to use parental to care for our infant as my wife will be busy and need to provide attention to our toddler. My supervisor is questioning my use of parental leave for this reason and is under the impression. When I mentioned travel he said parental leave should only be used for doctors appointments and for our newborn to receive medical care. I tried asking my HR department and they said they would need to verify. I did a quick search and found eCFR 630.1203 subpart L (i) and how it generally states it used to care for the newborn and also for bonding. Can anyone provide additional context on this?

" is my pay Fairly Balanced!? Hey everyone, i just discovered this community and I’m not too sure if my thread relates to the the community but please give your opinion on my dilemma. I work in a small retail store on a casual hourly pay. Our store has about 15 employees and everyone is casual. At one shift the store is managed by one staff all times. I am a full time uni student and i work about 3 night shifts 8 hours each which helps me to balance out my study properly and paying my bills. I have been working here for past 2 years. On night shifts we have 3 staff in total (including me) where I usually do 3 shifts and other 2 do 2 shifts each. I was asked by my store owner and manager that one of the night staff was going overseas for a month and half (6 weeks) and if i would cover his shifts. To which I happily agreed as i had a month of uni vacations after my exams and i found this as an opportunity to save some additional money and contribute to my uni fees. I also took few shifts off in my exam considering that i could recover the money doing more shifts in future weeks. When the other staff finally took off for his trip i saw the roster and i had the same 3 shifts but 1 of 3 on weekend ( penalty rates). I asked my boss and he said that the other colleague wanted to make bit more money than usual so he gave him 2 extra shifts. He believes that its fairly balanced since i would make about 850 dollars a week and the other colleague doing 4 shifts would make about 1100 a week. I usually make  780 a week doing 3 shifts and other colleague who did 2 shifts made 550 a week. How is this fairly balanced. I relied upon these shifts and i had some important decisions that this extra$ 3000 for 6 weeks would help me out to carry. I feel very sad and depressed. Considering that the boss would always bitch about other staff to me and say that i was his best employee. he didn’t considered me for these shifts and he himself assumed that i was in no need of extra money. I mainly work here for money i had sacrificed my health staying up at nights and disturbing my biological clock, my eyes have been twitching lately because of lack of sleep, i have gained weight and lost all my social life working night shifts on weekends for 2 years.

"Ask for a raise or wait until annual reviews?  Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but would love some input. Sorry for formatting - on mobile.So I’ve been working at my current company for technically almost 3 years, but my original firm was acquired by a much larger company (we’ll call them XYZ). For context, prior to the merger, I was switching from the technical side to the business development side of the company and was working that role 4 months before the merger. Company XYZ merger was completed early 2022 and for the first 2 months, they basically had me in a lull period trying to find a role for me. They stated that they didn’t have the same role I was doing available and then I was basically waiting for them to suggest roles that would be a fit for both myself and the firm. Finally in August, I was place in my current role. I do really like my job, the company, the culture, the benefits, etc. so I really don’t want to leave my job.Here’s where my frustration comes in. I was previously a business analyst and making about $67k/year. This was fine with me, but of course I would love to make more money. Now my dilemma is that I am working along side senior associates that all make well of 6 figures and I have the same $67k salary. There are 3 other people with my exact role title that are senior associates (two levels above my current level). We do the same job with the same functionality. With my new role I’ve been given a lot of executive tasks, working in management of project managers and on a council to run the portfolio I work on.As a responsibility of my new role, I’m involved with staffing calls and can see the budgeted salaries for open roles projects are hiring for. Business Analyst budgets right now are ranging between $85k - 120k. Since I’m no longer an analyst and in a higher project operation roles, I feel I should have received a salary increase with the promotion. I’m still making $67k and our annual evals are approaching in March 2023.Do I compose something to my boss requesting a meeting to discuss increasing my salary or wait until annual evals? I feel underpaid and unsure if it would come across entitled to ask for a $20k pay bump at this time? I would love any input or advice.For additional context: I did start browsing other jobs with similar roles and the salary should be $85k - $100k for my position. I did have a phone interview last week for a business analyst role offering me $95k… I don’t want to leave my job, but really want to be paid what I’m worth.",0

" Employer's forms for family leave do not match state law Hi all, I'm a full time employee with a large employer in California and have been with my employer for multiple years and am planning to apply for leave to care for a relative who recently suffered a serious injury.Part of the administrative process includes a google form that requires me to select that I am applying either a) for myself or b) for a parent, child, or spouse - however, under the California Family Rights Act, several other relatives are included, and I am applying for a different relative (grandparent) that is covered under the act. How should I best address this when completing the required documentation? Prior experiences with HR have already shown that they tend to try to deny leave for arbitrary reasons, so I'm trying to avoid any unnecessary headache while dealing with this difficult family situation.",1
"Will this hold in court? An ex friend did something really mentally abusive toward me a week ago and I ended the friendship. Turns out she also lied about what she did with her daughter. I was told she was stolen, by her sister but turns out (I have reliable sources) she starved the kid and had to forfeit her rights. My boyfriend found out about it, after he knew she hurt me and messaged her boyfriend to tell him. My boyfriend was extremely angry so he lashed out and did that. Apparently she had never told her new boyfriend any of this. She is still married and living with the husband and having sex with him so my boyfriend also told the guy this. He told him about the first child because she also neglects the second child, who has severe autism. Shes living with the abusive husband (she also abuses him physically and in front of the child)in a run down roach infested house. Shes using the husband for money while having cyber sex with the boyfriend. My boyfriend knew about this because we were all friends. He really lost it when she hurt me, and now shes saying shes hiring a lawyer because I ""slandered her"" even though I didnt. My boyfriend messaged the boyfriend.Is this slander or defamation?",1

"If my physical therapy center told me my treatment was approved by insurance and charged me the $35 copay three times, but it was never approved, do I have any legal recourse? My PT center charged me $35 on my credit card for each of three sessions at time of service. I asked the first time explicitly if this meant the sessions were approved by my insurance and the administrator/person at the desk said yes.I just received notice the first visit's claim was processed and denied, which has me on the hook for $377. If all sessions were denied, I would be on the hook for $1131 for services that I was under the distinct impression were covered and involved only a $35 copay.Unfortunately, I read reviews of other patients having billing issues (though not specifically this) and I strongly suspect that the claims were never approved, the girl misspoke and assumed they were approved, and charged the $35 copay because that's what they expected the copay to be.I understand getting an actual lawyer would be more expensive than the actual charge, but I'm considering doing something like legalshield just to get a demand letter because I suspect with the threat of legal action they may just decide to forgive the unexpected out of pocket charges.That said, is this even a situation where I would have legal merit in writing a demand letter to recoup unexpected out of pocket charges due to their misrepresenting information about my coverage?State: IL, US",1

After over 850 applications & 2mos from homelessness I risked lying hoping to slip through the cracks. Got hired. Bg check due tomorrow PSUEDO - TLDRTuesday was my first day at my new corporate-type job and I have to consent to the background check by Wednesday. My dishonesty will come to light in the next few days and I will be questioned for it. I accept I will most likely be dismissed immediately once the verification investigation concludes. Despite this, I am reaching out to a few relevant subs asking for any and all advice, ideas, insights, etc. that might increase my chances of coming out on the other side of this still employed.I've been unemployed for 16 months. I have become desperate and willing to risk lying on the slim chance of slipping by background check employment verifications by using only people references — either due to their process or individual HR incompetence / high workload.I knew it was a ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"" gambit. But after 16 months of no offers, draining my savings, maxing credit cards, raiding my retirement, destroying my credit, borrowing humiliatingly high amounts of money from family, having less than 2 months of expenses for surviving, deteriorating mental state, and close to losing my home and having to file bankruptcy, I felt like fuck it, why not, I’m not getting offers anyway.""It's easy enough to preach morality on a full belly.""After 14 years in my career, I never thought I'd be someone lying on their resume, and have chastised people in the past for doing so with easily-verifiable info like dates, degrees, etc. But rapidly approaching total financial destitution with no income for almost 2 years, going through a brutal divorce, and nearing another mental collapse, I have loosened my ethical lens to decide that yes, I will steal a loaf of bread to feed myself; the risk is worth it.My first attempt to return to work after my grippy socks hospitalization in February 2021, was in February 2022. It was a failure: I was dismissed promptly two months later in April 2022. This is the job I used as my ""current"" employer. That's six months of lies on top of the lie that I currently have a job.Prior to that, I was fired in July 2021 after 2 years of employment due to my admission to the psychiatric hospital that February because I exhausted my FMLA and PTO. This is where my life fell apart. Insurance limits meant I was released in May 2021 but unfortunately ended up there again in August 2021.I have tried my hardest to follow my own advice and treat finding a job as its own job. Since July 2021, I have applied for over 750 jobs with a few dozen interviews with over 1,000 ""engagement actions."" This includes applying, coffee chats with people who work at or have connections at companies I wanted to work at, interview homework assignments, round-robin or panel interviews, and networking events. This is both within my career and anything I could be remotely qualified for, including a ""survival"" job. I've also reached out to my local unemployment offices for help including career transitioning help since I've been losing hope that I can ever get hired in my field again. They’re completely overwhelmed and it’s been fruitless.I have worked non-stop without breaks since I was 16 and have been successful in my field for 14 years. The pride in my career, ethic, ambition, and character at work have been major parts of who I am.

" Manager is starting an investigation and hinting at getting my license revoked I am a nurse and I left my stable and awake post-op patient with the anaesthetist and the surgeon because my shift finished and I had a commitment to attend (which I already communicated earlier in the day stating if we went ahead with the third case and we don’t finish on time, then I would not be able to stay). The case was not discussed (according to the policy, a briefing should be done before collecting a patient for surgery- this was not done and not everyone in the team knew that the patient was sent for). Note that this is a frequent occurrence at work which mostly leaves staff with no choice but to stay overtime regardless of their personal plans or commitments. You just find out for example at 18:00 that you won’t be able to finish your shift on time- sometimes people go home at 3, 4am. Two of the managers held an “informal” meeting with me (I asked if someone could take the minutes but they insisted it was just a talk) and asked that I submit a written statement. I have written to my union because managers will be (if they haven’t already) contacting HR to hold an investigation and they kept emphasising I could lose my license (I have thought of this and many other consequences but I got fed up doing surprise overtimes and getting a nonchalant “that’s part of the job” response).The managers are heavily focusing on the “safety of the patient” theme but clinically the patient was stable- I would not have left them otherwise.

But some interesting things developed and it felt like it needed it's own post, so here goes.Firstly, thank you to those who gave some really amazing reassurances, advice, and experiences. I knew this wasn't a spectacular or riveting situation, but the feedback was very helpful for me.The original update I was going to give was going to be somewhere along the lines of one commenter's person journey and how he turned himself around. It turns out, all his ""irrefutable excuses"" were verified fact. He did get delt at a few terrible cards from life at once and they had an impact on him in many ways.Last week, we had a solid conversation/discussion re-stating the expectations for his role. This summer he was hired to sell one product, then when I came on he was switched to learning a new product. Needless to say, he truly had been ""alone on his own island"", as we call it at work, for months before I came back on. He wasn't ""fully aware"" this sales switch was supposed to happen... and I find that hard to believe. Regardless, we re-calibrated. And he.. started performing? I was skeptical, but it was all looking on the up and up. And then, through some time, I started realizing more things. The ultimate realization was that we will be replacing him in the near future, but moreso because he chose to move on to a different occupation (he mentioned wanting to apply for a far more suitable job for him in conversation. Hey, man. You do you.).Sounds like a meh update, right? Why bother updating?And then I find out today what had happened yesterday...I get a PM from my boss on my way in to work that ""J is leaving at 1pm today to service his car before his RTO tomorrow."" And I simply responded ""OK then..."" He knows exactly what I mean by my response. AGAIN?! Another conveniently-timed out from work? And I get to pick up his duties? Fine. Whatever. The day is what it is.Today, it comes to light that J had a text altercation (vague for reasons) with a different dept's semi-coworker off the clock yesterday evening... We know some details, but not enough to comprehend any sort of ""why???"". This particular series of events is quite out of left field and we are all a bit whiplashed from it.

"Can I sue FL school board for their failed SLD program? Explanation:When in elementary school I was placed in an SLD class to ""help"" me. The class was filled with trouble-maker kids who took the teacher's attention away from the few kids who actually needed help. Countless times these other kids would throw things at me, insult me, etc., and any and every time I attempted to retaliate I was the only one who got in trouble for the situation.One SLD ""teacher"" withheld my lunch until I completed a math worksheet. This same ""teacher"" told my mother on one occasion that I was ""taking the place (in her class) of a student who could be there instead. Also, in that same class, I poked a pencil through my shirt. (I was a child and didn't care.) Because I said I didn't care when she confronted me about it, this ""teacher"" decided to call a young child ""white trash"".From there I was bounced to my third elementary school. In this class, the teacher had very little patience for me due to the divided attention with trouble-maker kids.I had a friend at the time who was being home-schooled. Being an overweight child with glasses in a classroom full of abusive, bullying, troublemaking kids, coupled with being punished for even attempting to defend myself, being home-schooled was looking awesome.We tried, but my mom was working during the day and I had a short attention span, so needless to say I fell through the cracks.I attempted to go to middle school but I was again forced into an SLD class that only had one other child besides myself that actually need help. The rest of the students were trouble-makers.After about a year I dropped out of middle school after getting sick and never went back.I attempted to go to GED classes, but I was in the same problem I was before. I needed help to understand the work I was doing, in a class with a teacher who didn't care.",1

" Supverisor denied my ADA request for temporary WFH. Any advice is appreciated. HiI was on FMLA for 3 months and a 1 month leave extension through an ADA acommodation.My 1 month extension has ended and my physician has requested an ADA accomodation for a temporary work from home accomodation that would end on 04/2023. 5 months from now in order for therapy and medication to fully take effect.A 3rd party company sent in the request to my employer and the HR leave specialist forwarded that to my supervisor/manager.I found out through another supervisor (who is my friend) that my direct supervisor denied my WFH accomodation request. I am waiting to hear official word from my HR leave specialist.My department has several different locations spread across the US and there are full time employees, that have the same job desciription as I do, that work from home. A good amount of them work on site and also a lot of them work from home currently.My specific site in the department has 90% of the employees working onsite with 10% of the employees working from home on a per diem status.So I'm not understanding why my supervisor, who is also my manager, is denying my request for a 5 month temporary work from home accomodation when there are a good amount of employees, with the same exact job description and license as I do, working from home.What options do I have at this point as an employee with a confirmed disability that falls under ADA?Thanks",0

" ADA accomodations aren't respected? I have neurological and psychiatric disabilities and formally applied for ADA accomodations. I work remotely out of WY for a CA based company of less than 250 people. One of the accomodations is uninterrupted work time, as distractions can derail me and it's very difficult to get back on track.I have been notified that I need to attend meetings every afternoon for 1.5 hours (they are usually 2-2.5 hours), in addition to 2 hour meetings in the mornings. These meetings are mostly unstructured, AKA there's no set agenda. I don't see the point in attending them if Im not participating (and I'm not experienced enough to bring in clients), and just being in the meeting distracts me because of the talking and needing to listen in case Im called on. The reason to attend: so that the CEO can ""see"" me working. That's it. My performance is not in question, and Im afraid that so many hours in meetings will hinder my performance in the near future.In addition, I feel extremely guilty for leaving before everyone. I dont know how to bring it up other than being direct and announcing that I have accomodations in place. I dont think I should have to do this, but I feel very embarrassed and guilty for leaving meetings first every day. Advice?HR isn't very helpful and Im afraid of losing my job. I know that I have a case if I do get fired, but I want to avoid that. Leaving the company is not an option right now, and Im trying to ""suck it up"" as best as I can.

" When / how far in advance should I notify my company of my retirement? I   work for a huge company in Indiana you would all recognize if I said it. I am eligible for official retirement when I turn 55 (small pension, healthcare coverage until 65, other small retiree perks), which I turn this coming year (late 2023, about a year from now).  With the current direction of the economy and my lack of trust of large corporations, my chances of getting caught up in a downsizing within the next year are higher than normal.  Additionally, I’ve slightly ""quiet quit"" to the extent possible in a desk job. I just do the minimum needed to do a good job, but I’m not stepping up anymore to do extra, not coming in early or staying late like I used to, not offering to train new employees or volunteer for committees, etc.If I notify my company now of my intention to officially retire one year from now, what considerations are there I should keep in mind ?  Specific questions :Does being ""on notice"" for retirement make it less likely I’ll be downsized (fear of lawsuit, age discrimination, etc)?Does announcing it this early hurt me in some way - demotion? Reassignment to make my life miserable? Ineligibility for an early buyout / retirement packages that may be announced in the next year ?If now is not the best time, when is the best time to benefit me the most?As many states are, Indiana is an at-will state, but does the little ""retiring"" check-mark next to my name change the game on this in any way?",0
" Powerful people and groups ignoring the constitution in spite of court orders. What happens? With the recent 2A rulings from SCOTUS, one ruling and a bunch of GVRs, and the State of California putting forth a proposal for a new law that everyone can recognize is a direct violation of the SCOTUS ruling, it raises a question in me.Be it California or Texas, what happens when a State simply ignores SCOTUS and does their thing anyway? Texas says ""All guns are now legal, anywhere any time, for everyone."" and the ATF shows up knocking on Billy Bob's house for violating Federal Laws, but the Sheriff shows up and arrests all the Federal Agents for violating Billy Bob's rights. Or California says ""All guns are Illegal for everyone not a law enforcement agent/officer.""You get all the Federal Court orders, but they are ignored by the State. The courts all agree that California/Texas are in the wrong, but they're doing it anyway in defiance of the court order. Or, say President Biden threatens to ignore SCOTUS and enforce his own laws, be they passed by congress or not.

" Need help/suggestions/opinion- sick leave Hi, I am an employee in desperate need of a suggestion from an experienced HR. I work in a big corporation, and I am literally scared to ask HR in the company I work for, since I feel I will not get a candid answer. The thing is: I got burnout, and depression. It is very difficult for me to work now: I either look at the screen and am not able to work, or (depending on the day/moment) I can do some work, but extremey slow. I am normally slow (although good :-) ... I just need more time than usual) but now that I am not well, the thing is off the chart. I would benefit from an extended sick leave - and I would have no probem getting it since my doctor has known me and treated me for depression for years) but I am literally terrified, since I dont want to be put in a box of a weak person, mentally unable to be given responsibility work, etc. Besides, I feel shame and it would be embarassing for me to go back to work and look my colleagues in the eye. Work has always been important for me and despite my ""handicap"" w depression, I had a good albeit not super, career and I feel I have contributed to the good of the companies I worked for.  So, showing that I just cannot work now feels terrible.I thought about an alternative solution: ask for a time reduction like working few hours...maybe in that way, I would be able to do some work (maybe I will need 40 hours to do a 20 hours workload, but ok...) and, as I see it, a time reduction will not be seen as bad and will lead to much less corridor rumors. I actually dont know whether I will be able to work, even fewer hours, but I can try. The drawback is that the company always accept a worktime reduction request, but not always will give back the normal worktime once the person asks it back (which would be hard for e economically). The other drawback is that I would not be able to really switch off and recover.So you see, I don´t know what to do. And the stress of this decisions just adds up onthe stress I already have due to my situation. I hope you can help me giving to me your opinion. Thanks for reading !",0

All of these things led to needing loans and racking up credit card debt. Weren't spending money on tons of extras, kept one car, but school was in a very expensive city so cost of living killed us. FF to now: both of us have full time jobs, combined gross income of about $110k/year in a good year. Due to paying loans and revolving debt we're just sinking lower.

"Tire Shop Broke my radiator/transmission and tried to fix it with glue. Short Version: While fixing a hole in a tire, a mechanic cracked the radiator and damaged the transmission and tried to fix it with glue.  Later that same week during a pouring rainstorm on a busy highway my car starting pouring out smoke.  The transmission is totaled and frankly I or my four year old son could have been killed.Since the purchase of my car, it has only been to the dealership for all maintenance with one exception.  I have tires replaced at a private family shop.  On Tuesday last week my wife woke with a flat tire. The local tire shop (a small family business out of their house) said they'd be able to fix it.  I picked the car later on that afternoon.  I asked him how much it was? he said it depends how I would pay but cheapest was $20 cash.  So i gave him the cash and he didn't give me a receipt which I thought was strange but he seemed busy and ran out of the room so I didn't press it.  I'm not normally a receipt guy but my wife keeps all the car records in a binder so I know it's important to her thankfully.So the car was driven for a week--no more than 20 minutes at a time, 50 minutes a day--just town driving.  But that following tuesday after the repair, I had to take my four year old son from his MiL to my parents  up north. My wife had become really sick in the night and I was worried about infecting him.  But on the highway--in the rain--there was the smell of something burning.  Thinking that the flat had reappeared I pulled to the side of the road.  But when I got out to inspect the tire I noticed that a cloud of smoke was billowing from the engine.  So i ran over to my sons side of the car, got him out and told him the car could be on fire and we needed to move far away from it.  So we stood in the woods in the rain waiting for my mother to find us and AAA to tow  the car away.The mechanic at the dealership let me know today what happened.  There is a connector between the radiator and the transmission that had been cut off. There was damage to the radiator that someone had tried to patch with glue.  When I asked him if it was something that could have happened in lifting a car or fixing a tire he said it could have.  But he was concerned that the piece hadn't been replaced and the shoddiness of the repair.  The transmission is ruined and further diagnostics are being done to assess additional damage.To me and my wife it seems like an open and shut case.  The car was broken during the ""repair"", the mechanic tried to cover it up quickly, and it could have killed my son or me and it'll cost at least seven grand to repair.Is this the kind of thing that I should bring to a lawyer?  My brother seems to think I should ask the tire guy his side of the story and see if he wouldn't settle out of court.  My opinion is that it was reckless, cowardly, irresponsible and shameful.  I'm not interested in his side because that time has long past.If so, what kind of information should I try to get to help my case? We have service records from the car proving no work to the transmission or radiator were every performed.  The mechanic at the dealership said that the piece was cut off and glue was applied showing that it didn't happen by act of god.  I have text messages discussing the tire plus phone logs to the tire shop.  I'm going to be getting pictures of the damage tomorrow.  What else should I do?",1

"Pennsylvania: Kicking out a roommates friends? So I live in a place with a roommate.  We’re both on the lease and both pay half the rent and things like that. Well a few months ago, we had a falling out and kinda hate each other now.  Our lease ends soon and we are both moving away luckily so that’s not a problem.  The problem though, is that my roommate has gotten hostile and passive aggressive around me all the time and most recently has started inviting friends over all the time and being loud, exclusively when I’m sleeping (I work nights, so midday) on days where I work that night.  It’s never enough to be a noise disturbance to neighbors especially since it’s mid afternoon usually, but it’s very disruptive to my sleep and ability to work.My question is if I am legally allowed to kick out their friends.  Obviously I can’t make my roommate leave since they are on the lease and all and it would be moot since the notice time would be longer than the time we have left before we move.  But their friends don’t live with us, and aren’t on the lease.  They are only there to visit, for less than 24 hours at a time, and have a place to go home to.  So it wouldn’t be an eviction or anything.Normally if I lived alone, if a friend came over and I wanted them out I could kick them out and if they refused I’m fairly certain it would start elevating to the point of trespassing?  Would that still apply if my roommate is the one letting them in?  What can I do to get these people out of my house so I can get some sleep?",1

" I am getting retaliation for going to HR and being discriminated against for my gender? I believe I am getting retaliation at work and discriminate against because of my gender. I am looking for an outsider to see if this all makes sense. I recently spoke with HR because I thought my manager was about to fire me. She took away my responsibility and hired another person with my title without telling me; her manager ignored my email. The HR person told me that I would not be fired but would be placed on a PIP. This is a shocker to me because I have been traveling around the country to get the company to achieve its biggest goal this year. The CEO and another C-Suite person thanked me in front of the whole company. The HR person hinted that I should find other jobs because she and her boss (C-Suite) wanted this PIP. Even if I survive the PIP, there will be no other leadership but them that I report to. This HR person also mentioned that my manager would go on maternity leave early next year, and she wants a consultant she had worked with before I joined the company to take over her role. This news put everything in context for me, and I believe she is trying to get rid of me before she leaves.Within three weeks of my joining the company, my manager asked me to complete a critical task that usually would take 3-5 weeks to complete to be complete in 1 week. I did what she wanted and worked late into the night and early morning to push it through, even late into the night and early morning to push it through and get it done, even though I felt it was a rush job that may not have been done correctly. Mistakes were found a week later, and we had to redo it again. After the fiscal, I asked her where did she get the timeline to rush this task. She didn't have a timeline and just stated what she believed should be done now. I was shocked and realized she had never done a timeline in her career. I told her I would create a timeline for the project. At first, she supported me, but then she told me not to use work time to do this timeline, only use my free time after spending free time and pulling a couple of all-nighters building the timeline and sharing it with other functional groups. Everyone applauded me for helping them make sense of the project timeline. We learned that we could have taken more time to do the task instead of pushing ask request by the manager. At that time, I reached out to HR to ask them to help me communicate with her because she would ask to rush a task without proper planning. She also said she wants to support, but she has no intention, for example, the timeline she told me to work in my free time. HR promised they would have the head of HR reach out to me. This never happened; instead, the head of HR reached out to my manager to meet with my manager. Soon after this meeting, I was told I was not fit for the company culture and needed to take an emotionally intelligent communication Linkedin course that my manager had already taken.  After this, I could tell that my manager didn't trust me anymore as she kept me out of a lot of important information last minute, and in fact, I didn't know she was going on maternity leave until HR told me.I was the first male hire in the group where all leadership with direct reports (4 different department Directors and VP), including my manager, are female and report to a C-suite person who is also female. I was made feel aware of my gender on serval occasions. On my first day on the job, there was a meeting, and the C-suite person commented, ""all women had to fly in for the meeting. How can you trust your husband to care for your kids?"" I was the only man in the room, so I felt very awkward. Another comment was made several months later direct to me from the C-suite person ""Oh, you are married. Do you have your wife iron your clothes?"" This C-suite mentioned several times that she wanted to mentor women to be in leadership positions, which makes sense why women hold all leadership roles in the group.  My manager recently hired someone with the same job title as me, but she has four years of experience than me. The job description requires 5-year experience. She only has three years of experience. The consultant who will replace the manager on maternity leave is also a woman. I understand that this all could be a coincidence, but it is hard for me not to feel like there is some preferential treatment of the other gender.",0

" FMLA Eligibility after break in employment Hi, two part question.

So, I worked for my employer for 2 years, and left for 2 years, and returned to the same position 11 months ago. I also found out I was pregnant within weeks of returning, with a due date before I would have worked 1250 hours. I was therefore not eligible for FMLA or maternity leave, and I had to take all my PTO, returning in only a few weeks - way before I was physically ready but unable to negotiate more time off.

Q1: Now that I've returned, and now that I've hit the 1250 hour mark, am I eligible for FMLA again? Based on the DOL website, that's what it feels like it should be, however my HR says no because I don't have 12 consecutive months. It's a non-issue really since my anniversary of hire is in November, but if they're not interpreting the law correctly I'd like to point it out (tactfully of course) because they may not be complying with others.

Anywho, Q2: am I interpreting the things correctly that even though the baby was born in June, once I am eligible for FMLA I am able to take up to 12 weeks for bonding as long as it is completed before the baby turns 1?

" Should i take a followup again? got a call from HR from a good company. He explained the job role and shared the first assessment with me. I completed that and he again shared an aptitude test. I submitted it the same day within the deadline and informed him over email. Then 5 days later, I received an email from him that I have cleared both assessments and he is waiting for the time slot to schedule my interview. Then, 3 days later he called to inform me that the interview is scheduled for the day after tomorrow and that he'll let me know the time on the same day.But, I didn't receive any mail or invitation till the evening so I sent a follow-up email to him. He responded that he'll call the next morning to let me know the further process. But, I didn't receive any call or update. So, I called to know if there is any interview lined up for me. He said the interviewer is busy right now, he'll fix the meeting and let me know. It has been 2 weeks since then and I haven't gotten any update from HR. I have checked on the website, my application status is still in screening as 15 days ago.Should I take a follow-up again or is there something else I should do? Or, should I just wait for him to connect with me?",0

"Property Line Issues I bought a house in December of 2020. The sellers were flippers, but had a survey done so they could put up a new fence (I'm 706, neighbor I'm referencing is 708).In January, the property behind my house and my next door neighbors house, was sold to a developer to put up condos (705, 707, 709).He's claiming that his property is 6 ft into my back yard (red line in image).  Please note that until this developer came a long and took down a fence, it had been up for about 20 years or so (fence was on the property lines, but belonged to 705-709). My back fence was built basically up against that fence (leaving about a 6 inch gap between the two.The county records show the property as what was indicated on my recent survey (image is of county records).What are my protections?  They found the iron pipe where that red line is, but the property lines were established for at least 20 years.My next door neighbor has a litigation lawyer he's engaging with, which he said is good for me since if he deals with it, it would establish both of our property lines.I'm just a little freaked out as I don't have a ton of money to be spending on litigating a developer who wants to put condos behind me and take possession of my land.https://preview.redd.it/3hjq1wzeusv71.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ba69380ce12e7f4c5300166343c2743c1eb9b84",1

" Never received sign on bonus and want out of contract Bear with me as I’ll do my best to explain. I just started working for a new company and part of my hiring process was signing a contract for a sign on bonus. The caveat to the agreement is that I would need to stay in the specific department for 2 years. Per my understanding of the agreement, I was supposed to receive the first portion of the payout upon hire, the next payout at a year and the final pay out at the two year mark and end of the commitment period. Now here’s my dilemma…I have already worked for the company for about 2 months (60 days) and haven’t seen any of the bonus. I have been off of orientation and in my role since before a full month in as well. After rereading the document, I did see that it stated I would receive my pay 45 days after the completion of the commitment payment. My question is, can I use this as a loophole to get out of my contract? Part of the agreement is that I have to stay in my role in my department for the duration of these two years but since I never got the first portion of the payout, can I just have them void my contract? I really don’t like the new position so if it means sacrificing that chunk of change I would do it.Looking for any type of advice or clarification on this matter and I apologize if I left out info or don’t make sense, I’m very emotional about the whole ordeal and my job in general at the moment.",0

"Legal ramifications of a protestor getting killed while blocking traffic. We've all seen those videos online of people protesting various things by intentionally standing in the way of traffic, and there are always comments on those videos from people saying something to the effect of ""if that was me in the car, I'd just hit them lol!""That got me wondering what would be the legal consequences of that actually happening. Suppose the protestor died and their family pressed charges. Or if the protestor didn't die but was severely injured and wanted to press charges personally. Suppose the operator of the vehicle tried in good faith to honk or slow down, basically everything short of actually stopping their car? Or suppose they made the defense that they didn't see the protester? How would that play out in court? Would the fact that the protestor knowingly put themselves in danger provide any legal defense to the driver?",1
" FMLA paperwork? So, I dislocated my knee (outside of work) on oct 11 and it’s caused me to miss a lot of work since I’m barely able to walk/ on crutches. I went to the ER when it happened and was referred to an orthopedist who then ordered me an MRI on Oct 28th and wrote me a work note with a bunch of restrictions and that I should be off work 10-14 days or until my MRI results come back. Also said I most likely would need surgery considering this same knee has dislocated in the past.My employer checked to see if I was eligible for FMLA, which I was, so they asked me a few questions and wrote everything down, and then told me I would get paper work in the mail and if I didn’t receive it within a week that I would have to call the FMLA phone number they gave me.

" challenging coworker Connecticut challenging coworkerI have a coworker who has been a challenge for me to work with since I started at my job a few years ago. She is  does the same job I do along with a few others, and we work remotely currently. She is very confrontational and goes from 0-10 over nothing, she attempts to give herself the lightest workload possible, refused to help train our new coworker leaving it basically to myself because of staffing issues, and she’s just a bully. I try to limit talking to her as much as possible but it’s not completely feasible. She causes dysfunction in the group especially if she feels she doesn’t want to do something she throws a tantrum. Yesterday while trying to have a conversation about our workload (that I share with her) i requested to make a change on something we were working on editing as a group and changing it around as we do from our manager (normal process we do, she gets upset everytime) and she refused and said she’d quit first because she just doesn’t want to split that part or do it at all (it’s expected we all know how to and are willing to do this part of the assignment). I attempted to stay calm but she continued to escalate and then accused me of saying things I didn’t. I’m done with this situation, problem is that if I talk to my manager I’m afraid things are going to be much worse. She and another coworker in our group are very cliquish so it’s them against us kind of thing, but seems mostly focused on me. I don’t trust her and I don’t know how she’ll retaliate, I’m also afraid to risk losing working from home. Any advice is greatly appreciated, my husband says ignore her my friend says talk to my manager. I try to be nice to everyone and I worked well with others in the past.",0
" Should I file a complaint against my manager with HR? I was moved into a newly acquired company under a new manager a year ago as part of a restructuring, and my manager and I don’t have the best relationship. I don’t trust them, and I feel like they are trying to freeze me out of the business.This past year, they basically kept me on ice while I continued to manage my accounts on my former dept’s technology platform, which was being phased out.Management called the restructuring a merger, but basically the employees have been left to solve all the issues ourselves, which includes waiting for my accounts to transfer to the new org’s operating environment.I don’t think my manager has supported me during the merger or made me part of the new org.For example, they don’t hold team meetings. They communicate poorly, and they don’t hold individual meetings. So there’s little feedback given or received, and I’m not really part of a team. There are also little things like not turning on their camera on Teams calls. Exception, if their boss is also on the call, then the camera comes on - but not for direct reports.Recently, with the start of the new fiscal year, our dept’s director (my boss’s boss) appointed me to lead part of my manager’s team alongside another team lead, but my manager has undermined this. Before I could start the role, they did an about-face and told me to stick to my current duties.They are one of those why-because-I-say-so bosses, and their tone has also become a bit harsh in emails. “You must not…”. I respond much better to a friendly ask, like most people.I escalated this to our director but she doesn’t answer my emails. So it seems mgmt wants me to deal directly with my line manager, who isn’t replying to my emails. And really does not seem to care.I have a longer list with more examples collected this past year, but I really don’t want to escalate this to HR. What other options do I have to protect myself from this bad actor?TLDR: Should I report a bad manager to HR?

"Breaking our lease… Looking for help to see if we have any ground to break our lease. We are in Jefferson county in Colorado. Below are a list of things that we believe might be grounds for us to break our lease but we need help.On 10/31/21 we excessive gas in our kitchen and our oven was inspected as hazardous with a delayed ignition, at this point I believe the house was legally considered unhabitantable. Out landlord asked us to contact kenmore for repairs, they arrived 11/02/21 and could not fix the oven due to no on/off valve for the gas line leading into the oven, the valve was installed 11/6/21. We finally got a new oven on 11/18/21 that does actually cook food despite it reading that it’s preheated (took 2.5hrs to roast veggies at 350). But either way we had  the hazardous appliance that sat in the home for almost three weeks.There weren’t any smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors installed until 11/10 and my lease started in June. We have one smoke detector in our main hallways and two carbon monoxide detectors installed one in the kitchen and one in the main hallway. None in the basement or private bedrooms, despite local law requiring it.The master bath has a sink in the bathroom which was spitting out dark brown water on 11/10 my roommate notified our landlord. He had a repair come out to see what was going on, the plumber let us know that all of our bathroom water lines were completely galvanized and the brown water was from the rust. He has not yet fixed that despite having the plumber personally text us that he would arrive but it has been three weeks and the sink remains running rusty water. All of us have been have hair falling out like crazy for months and I’m wondering if this is why.

" How screwed am I? I think I made a terrible error. All of my experience on my resume (4) says “Full-stack Software Developer” instead of “Full-stack Software Developer intern”Background:Currently a senior at a college in the US. Finished 4+ rounds of interviews for an entry position at a top-tier company in the US. Got offer and signed. Received a form from Sterling for background check.I was filling out the form for my employment history and opened up my resume for reference. And… I realized none of my experience had “intern” in job titles.This is the resume I’ve been using for all the applications.I’ve seen from other posts that you should be fine if you clarified they were internships during the interviews. However, I am not sure if I did for all of them. I did clarify, though, for two of them when I had to elaborate on each of them but I think that’s it. (I was only asked questions for two of the experiences)I honestly don’t know why I did not put intern for my job title. Maybe I thought it was implicit considering I was in school and those positions were short-termed (4 months for each)…… I’ve never had an intent to deceive any but honestly speaking, everyone could make the claim…. I am extremely anxious that my action can be deemed as a fabrication—or even at best, conducting unethical resume exaggeration.Thank you all for reading.

I ended up kissing one of the guys who was sober on the top of his as a little joke bare in mind that U would say his social skills arent the greatest.Fast forward to when we're working in the office and at the some stage during the day he came up behind me and kissed me on the top of my head unexpectedly.Now I know my actions silly and as much as I regretted doing it, it wouldn't really bother me if it was outside work hours but during work hours it did. I was just curious if my drunken behaviour outside of work hours should be toned down a little so I don't do anything stupid like that again.",0

" HR gave misleading/questionable info on FMLA and STD leave…. I have a fairly serious chronic health condition. I’ve been with my job for close to 1.5 years and have managed working full time well, but my symptoms have really flared lately to the point I need medical leave. I also have STD coverage through my employer.I brought up my need for leave with my supervisor last week and had a phone chat with HR about my options. Both were very supportive and my HR rep advised I would likely qualify for both FMLA and STD. HR provided me with forms and encouraged me to see my PCP asap. I then got a bit of sassiness/rudeness from upper management on my team - but I get it, having people out can be rough.However, after the weird stuff from upper management I received an email from the same HR rep with completely different and somewhat misleading/false advice-“Unfortunately based on what you have shared with me yesterday regarding your chronic health condition that you mentioned was diagnosed in 2019, I do not believe that you currently qualify for a short-term disability leave or FMLA leave. If after seeing your doctor next week there is additional diagnosis or treatment plan please let me know and I can help you through the leave request process if your doctor feels you are unable to work. However without a medical document supporting your request for time off  to deal with your health we are unable to move forward”From what I understand chronic conditions are clearly covered under FMLA? I read a chronic condition is defined as one you’ve sought treatment for at least twice in the last year, which I meet. I also called the insurance company and discovered that chronic conditions are covered by STD after a 12-month waiting period, which I also satisfy.In any case- I saw my doctor today (as the HR rep originally advised- I was so confused by the email’s end as we had already discussed I would need documentation) and he’s fully supportive to sign off for FMLA and STD. So the point is kinda moot- I’m going to get my leave and hopefully my disability. Im just feeling a little icky about this. I work for a company that loves to tout its great benefits and human-centric culture. This experience honestly makes me feel discouraged from returning to the company after my leave.So AskHr, what should I do? Of course, I could do nothing- I’m going to get the leave I  need. I just find 2 things really unethical: the change in advice that seems to have been influenced by managerial needs, and that that advice is misleading/bordering on false. Should I file an internal or external complaint? Something else? Just feeling icky and kinda bummed that this experience has made me not want to return to a job I’m good at and previously enjoyed :(",0

" Co-worker is stalking me/trying to get me fired I have a co-worker that started late 2021, he asked me out after he was there for about 2 weeks. I declined.Here is the backstory to the current situation:Fast forward to March 2022, I was injured badly at work, and need surgery. In late April the doctor evaluated me and decided it was too dangerous for me to drive. So from May until now I've been stuck at home (my manager decided my position isn't a work from home position) on what feels like house arrest. In this time I've been trying not to lose my sanity, and went on vacation at the beginning of the month. This is the same vacation I take every year (for the last 6 years) with my mom, and we go volunteer for 5 days and vacation the rest. I called my adjuster at the beginning of August to make sure it was okay for me to go.After 2 weeks of calling and leaving messages, which were never returned, I just asked another adjuster I managed to get on the phone. She said it would be fine as long as I don't miss any appointments, and I follow my restrictions. She notated it in my file and requested I get a call back. A week later, still no call from my assigned adjuster. So I call again, and ask the same questions, and get the same answer. Don't miss appointments, and don't break restrictions. Again no call back. I had another Dr. appointment, talked to him about the vacation, he gave me better pain meds, and wanted me to get a cortisone shot, which I can't schedule, my adjuster has to. This was mid September, it's now October 16, I went on the vacation and still no call about by shot. UGHNow for my coworker, who we will call Steve. After I was told by the doctor I can't drive (originally it was no driving or even riding in a vehicle, but the would mean I couldn't even get a ride to appointments, so that was removed) and was stuck at home, Steve began stalking me. I was warned by some of my employees and other coworkers, in addition, they also told me that Steve had begun making lewd comments about me. I asked them to report it, but with our reporting system the complaint is recorded and the person whom the complaint is about is allowed to listen to the audio, this makes it easy to figure out who made the complaint. Even though retaliation is not allowed, I've observed Steve berating employees, and making threats, and not being coached or disciplined.Anyway, I would post old pictures of me running (captioned as such and some were even reposts from 3 years ago) and mention how I missed running or hiking or whatever activity was in the picture. Posting was an outlet, and I got a lot of positive comments from friends and others who had the same injury and the process they had to go through. I also got suggestions about how to help manage the pain, or activities I could do that wouldn't aggravate it. So it is very helpful. I have also gotten countless messages asking about an update, and posting was a way to reach everyone concerned. Because I can't drive, sometimes my friends would come get me and take me to the beach to get me out of the house, I'd sometimes go 2-3 weeks without leaving my house, so these beach trips were a huge relief, and I would post a picture. Steve would go out of his way to use a friends social media to save pictures to show my boss, and claim I must be faking because I'm at the beach, and smiling. He bragged to my coworkers about using his friend's social media to get pictures of me.In addition, I finally went on my first vacation in a year, I posted a few pictures of me standing and volunteering or just standing with friends. I had told my boss about the vacation, my bosses boss, and, as mentioned above, tried to do my due diligence with my adjuster. This was not a secret trip by any means. While I was on vacation, my coworker called and said Steve was saying I must be faking because I look happy, and it looked like I lost weight (I haven't, but like everyone else I can be a little vain sometimes and I'm not going to post an unflattering picture) and I must be racing because no way I would just volunteer and not compete. (which this is completely verifiable as the competitor list is released publicly and I'm not on it, plus its a championship event and you have to qualify, even if I was healthy, I am no where close to good enough)  Steve told my coworker that my boss told him to watch out for anything suspicious. I don't know if my boss actually said that, because the coworkers that keep me informed said they never heard anything like that from him, or if it's just Steve saying it to hide the creep factor. But he is borrowing friend's Facebook and Instagram accounts to save all my pictures. I also saw him drive by my house when I was walking back, with my crutches, from checking the mail. I live in a small, closed loop neighborhood, he doesn't live anywhere by me, and there would be no reason for him to be there. I don't know how many times he's driven by my house, but it is creepy. I can't think of any reason for him doing all these things except for me turning him down for a date.I have no idea what to do. My mental health is in the dump, I'm frustrated it's taking this long to get surgery, I'm angry that my boss is allowing or maybe even promoting this behavior, I'm disappointed that they don't understand how awful this is, and I'm scared that this guy knows where I live and I don't know how far he will go. I just want to go back to work and have a purpose. Because of my mobility issues I can't even vacuum, I've passed out from the pain more than once, I'm basically a breathing lump. I also live alone, which is incredibly scary. One of the times I passed out from pain and fell on a crowbar and woke up in a small pool of blood.I need advice, I am so overwhelmed.Edited to add:When I was initially told I can't drive, my boss threatened to discipline me if I didn't get a ride from a friend or take an Uber to work. He was educated and told that I can't be told to spend my own money to get to work when my injury is workplace related, and I can't be disciplined for that. I feel like he is resentful because of it though.",0

"Landlord rights vs. renter rights, involving a church and a preschool I’m in Virginia, I run a preschool that rents our facility space from a church. We are our own entity, and not a part of the church, even if they tend to regard us as their mission. Recently the issue of sharing the private medical information of staff with the general public has arisen. (Yes, this is regarding staff receiving the Covid vaccine) Several of the church governing body believe that providing this information to anyone who asks is mandatory and not confidential, and have argued that families that attend or wish to attend must have this information to make an informed choice. As at this moment the state agency that we function under does not require that we share this information, it does come under the heading of confidential, and it is up to a staff member to share their personal, private information.  Given the wording of their statements I feel strongly that they will next be demanding that they know the same kind of information about the families that attend as well. So far my citing our mandate to keep confidentiality and that fact that dissemination of private medical information can open us up to lawsuits has not sunk in.The church has stated that unlessA. Every teacher is vaccinated and B. That we share this information with them/the general public we will have to change our procedures or close down.So as a landlord what are their rights over a business that is renting from them?

"Present Value of Annuity Hi everyone,Need some help understanding a basic finance question related to present value. I have the solution.. I'm just not quite seeing which reasoning is being applied to one part of the formula. Here's the question:Two dealers compete to sell you a new Hummer with a list price of $45,000. Dealer C offers to sell it for $40,000 cash. Dealer F offers “0-percent financing:” 48 monthly payments of $937.50 (48x937.50=45,000). You can finance purchase by withdrawals from a money market fund yielding 2% per year. Which deal is better?The solution is:Cash option PV = $40,000Financing option PV 2% = 937.50 * 1 / (1.021/12 - 1) *   = $43,228Answer: Cash option costs less.I recognize the PV formula being used for the financing option. I believe that formula is the t-period annuity formula.PV = C/r *  I see C=937.50 and t = 48 periods. Can someone help me understand the reasoning behind r being equal to 1.021/12 - 1? I'm not seeing that step.  When I did the problem, I had r being equal to .02 /12.",2

The interviewer for Company B stated that the process will likely take about 2 more weeks before a decision is made.I know when receiving an offer, candidates typically have 3 days to make a decision and you can typically ask for an extension but is two weeks too long?The role that I received an offer for at company A is not a role that I’m super passionate about compared to the role at company B, where I am still interviewing.Any advice on how to approach this situation? I know if I reject the offer at company A and wait to see if I receive an offer at the preferred role at company B, there is a chance that I don’t receive an offer from company B and then I’m left with no options.",0
" Failed background check I  work IT for a healthcare company in California, recently we had a guy that's moving to Singapore to work fully remote and we urgently needed to hire someone to replace him. We grouped interviewed a candidate and he was available to start immediately. During the interview we asked if his background check will come up with anything we should be aware of and he was truthful in saying that his criminal record is clean, but his credit history/score is a mess.My company decided to hire him on a 2 week contractor basis until his background check clears with HR. On Friday (yesterday) he came back and told me he didn't pass his background check and the reason for that was because HR would not accept his credit history, his criminal record is spotless.Feel bad for the guy as he quit his job expecting to be hired, he told me he has never experienced this before with any previous employer as everyone has less than perfect credit. It makes sense, at least in my mind, because how do  you expect anyone to pay off loans/debt without a job? Question I have is why would a company reject a application based on bad credit history but has a clean criminal history?",0
"I want my son to own the house he grew up in, with minimal tax consequences I'm hoping I'll find someone specialized in Texas real estate law and tax laws.

" Upfront costs for new job. Not sure if this standard I am about to close on a new job that I’m really excited for.

The relocation budget ($15k) isn’t dispensed until I acquire an address and utility bill in the new city. Leading up to that, I’d have pay to fly myself out to the office and for lodging while I look for a place and work at the office. Basically, the upfront costs are fairly significant. I’ve been at the same employer for a decade and am struggling to understand if this standard, or too risky? Everything else about the role and company checks out.

" I reside in IL but this position will be fully remote with the base location in CA. In negotiations for start date at new company, asked for a start date 2 months down the line, should would it be prudent for me to give the reason for the later start date. So I have been told by the HR rep that an offer is incoming (i know, nothing definite, but i want to be prepared for the situation).  In my last round of interviews, I was asked for my start date and I asked for 2023, when asked if there was a reason I said it was part business related and part family related (have a lot of vacation planned for the holiday season and don't want to  take most of my PTO at the start of a new company when i've been saving for it and covered by my current job).  They seem to want me to start earlier and mentioned that they would able to pay for my PTO and provide ample more, but also stopped the conversation there as it was more of just a finalization of the first round.The business related side of things is: I have a small chunk of change in stock options that vests in November, and also have a 12% bonus that gets paid out the first paycheck of 2023 (this is based on company performance and as our current company just finished it's fiscal year the financial report was sent out and we're doing well.  Historically, it's 12% * a business modifier factor depending on how well the company did.  Last year it was 123% and this year seems like it'll be trending the same way).While i don't have the exact number for a new salary, i have a range, and it certainly wouldn't be enough to cover the bonus and stock options that will be accessible shortly.Would it be kosher to disclose these items if the start date is further discussed?",0

I text my superior (who is also a friend) and told him that I wanted to use a sick day tomorrow which would be my last working day this week. He tried to strongly advise me against calling in saying that if I did so, my company would dig any and everything out of the woodwork to ""fire"" me so that they did not have to pay out my variable compensation or accrued pto for next year which could amount to a couple thousand dollars.I am not worried about losing out on the potential money, but if there is a way to avoid it that would be great as this was an incident I didn't mean to occur.My questions are as such.First, I guess is simply can they do that? I'm assuming they can since they know the loopholes, it seems unfair and it's not like I'm purposely trying to jerk the system, but I have a physical job and am in a fair amount of pain.Second, I am not anywhere near termination on our points system, if they forged that in a way that was used against me could I legally fight it?Third, is there any litigation at all that could protect me from them doing me wrong.

" recently got promoted Hi all,I’m posting this to see if I can get any advice on how to handle my situation. I recently got promoted at my current job. I used to be an admin assistant but now work under a different boss and my responsibilities completely changed. I agreed to help with the admin work until my company hired a new admin but it’s been two months now and they have not put an offer for an admin. My current job is stressful since I’m working at a school so I have shared with my current boss that doing both has become stressful for me. I also raised my concern to my old boss which fyi she’s in charge of the whole department. My old boss didn’t agree with my concerns and she said that I agreed to help out. She said that my current boss can do without me for one day out of the week and I can do my admin work. I have also expressed that I’m doing two jobs and being paid for one and if it was possible to get a stipend which they did not answer back. I’m also still being introduced as the admin assistant and it’s incredibly frustrating.Next week I’m meeting with my old boss to discuss the situation. Is there any recommendations? should I work as the admin for one day out of the week or should I say no. Thanks!",0

" Waiting a long time to get an offer… I am in a very bizarre (to me) situation. My final interview for this job was 9/9. On 9/30 the recruiter, who is a third party contractor/consultant, told me the hiring team wants to make me an offer. Slow, but great news.Then, a week of silence. I emailed the recruiter for an update on 10/11, and she promptly replies with something vague about “still waiting on offer details from the Reward team but some stakeholders are taking longer than anticipated.”So it has now been over 2 weeks since I was told I’d be getting an offer. I cannot imagine what is taking so long after the decision has been made. Shouldn’t they have a pay grade and such identified before posting the job?I can’t think why the recruiter might be lying to me. Even if I’m the backup candidate and she’s trying to ensure I don’t take another offer, you wouldn’t say an offer is coming right? You’d say something like “no decision has been made yet” or something.This is a massive international company over 20x the size of my current employer. I’m wondering:will I ever get an offer or are they stringing me along in someway I’m not seeing, and;should I interpret this as a red flag that this is how the company operates day-to-day and it’ll be a nightmare trying to get anything done there (or have a career there if this is even just HR)?",0
" - California - found out I need surgery, but quit old job and waiting to start new job in 3 weeks. Options?? Hi All! I’m in California.As the title suggests, I quit my job of almost 5 years and gave 2 week notice this week. For 4 of those years, I had an awesome position but wanted to grow with the company. I promoted to a new role almost a year ago and I had been miserable so I started applying for jobs. I was offered a great opportunity that was beyond my dreams! So I accepted the new job, submitted my resignation to my current employer, and will be starting with my new company in 3 weeks.For some time, I’ve been dealing with some health issues. I’ve been seeing Dr’s trying to figure out a diagnosis. I just learned today that I may require brain surgery to remove a pituitary tumor but waiting for a neurosurgeon to confirm and schedule the surgery if necessary. Once the surgery is done, the recovery might take 3-4 weeks to at least return to working from home.My first thoughts have been around my new job. Again, don’t know how long I can postpone surgery. The paid/sick leave at mg new job is accrued bi-weekly, but even if I saved it, I wouldn’t have enough paid leave to cover my recovery. Overall, I’m afraid of possibly being fired of my boss isn’t understanding and my new job isn’t protected by FMLA.I understand my health comes first, but without my job, health insurance, and income… there is no way I can afford this surgery alone while keeping my family afloat. From what I understand, I wouldn’t qualify for FMLA in Ca because I need to work with an employer for at least 12 months. Beyond what I know about FMLA, Im not familiar with state disability insurance, unemployment benefits, or any other state benefits…At this point it seems that my only recourse is tostart mg new job but postpone my surgery as long as possible so I can get FMLA, orrescinding my resignation and staying with my current employer so that I can qualify for FMLA, orstarting my new job, doing the surgery, taking unpaid leave from my employer after I use up my PTO/sick leave… but if I get fired then at least I can get unemployment but I’ll lose my health insurance.What would you all do in my situation? What am I missing there? Do I have any other options I don’t know about?I appreciate the advice and any suggestions on whether or not I should talk about this with either employer.",0
"Not looking for advice, just looking for estimates pertaining to a potential lawsuit For context of regional legality: this is in the city of Fort Collins, Larimer County, Colorado.So, I was recently hired for a job, and I've worked one day so far. The place is a smoke shop, part of a chain, and this location also acts as a distribution hub for the other stores in the chain, which is inter-county, so it's a fairly large scale 18/21+ organization. Problem is, in my one day, I've seen way, way too many red flags: firstly, they actually denied my application on Indeed and then a few days later asked me if I could come in for a trial shift because they were urgently hiring, apparently there had been something of a mass exodus of around 30 employees all quitting around the same time; they never asked me for any information, identification, paperwork, etc.; they pay in cash; they don't have a clocking in system; most importantly, when I was 5 hours into my 7 hour shift, I was taking a break as I was told to by my trainer after I finished what I was working on, and was about 5 minutes into that, when someone came in saying ""Hey, I'm the guy that pays people here, and I don't pay people to just sit around on their phones, so you just go home."" He kept cutting me off and was extremely rude, I didn't get to explain that I was in training and that I was supposed to learn how to close, instead he denied me a legally required break, and didn't even make me get back to work. Also, their communication has been extremely poor, no one knows anything about who's doing what or where they'll be or when.My current plan is to tell them that it's not working out and that I'd like to just get paid for the hours I worked - even if they want to argue that they don't have any documentation or record that I worked there, I'm going to bring it to the authorities that they denied me a break and my payment, and didn't ask for any identification despite being 18/21+, selling things like CBD and Delta 8 cannabis and kratom. Those things are illegal for employers to do, or neglect to do, and I do have evidence that I worked there, both in text conversations between me and the one who hired me as well as security footage in the store.So, if this does go to court, and if I win the lawsuit, what kind of payout would I be looking at, and what fees would detract from it by how much?",1

"Question about tenant rights without lease/mortgage I'm gonna give you the details but there is a TLDR at the bottom.My mother has been in a bad situation for awhile now. I'm going to run down the situation as concisely as I can. A couple of years ago my brother (44 yrs old) moved in with my parents. He ended up getting back into drugs. Fast forward a couple of years, my dad has since died and, and before he died, my brother managed to bleed my parents completely dry. He stole everything, ruined their credit, etc. I'll spare you the nasty details. They kicked him out shortly before my dad died, but a couple of months after his death, my mom let him move back in. She told me (I live halfway across the continent) he wasn't doing drugs and that he was giving her his paychecks. He bled her dry then convinced her she needed him to survive.I've known it to be bullshit for a long time but there was nothing I could do.Well, my mom called me the other day asking for help making a car payment. We haven't talked much since my dad died because she has been depressed and reclusive. Anyways, she confessed that she wants to sell her house and just get an apartment but she didn't think she could (she can) because of her reverse mortgage. I also woke up to texts this morning telling me how abusive my brother is, how she would call when she could but not to reply to texts because he is monitoring her phone.I have a plan to get my mom out, sell her home, and give her financial breathing room.First things first: Gotta get the brother out of the house. If she said ""leave"" he would not.What rights does he have, having lived there for awhile? He is not on the mortgage and does not have a lease. Could she just call the cops if he did not leave?TLDR: Can we legally kick my abusive junkie brother out of my mom's home or does he have some tenant rights having lived there for awhile?",1

"HOA Dispute My HOA (condo complex) recently held an unannounced vote to remove dumpsters from the community in favor of trash cans with curbside pickups. The problem is that there was no planning for storage of the new trash cans for the upstairs units. The layouts of the condos are you walk in the front door, and there is an 8’ long x 4’ wide space to the left when the front door is open leading to the stairs that take you into the living room/kitchen. In speaking with the HOA, they have said that all downstairs units can store their bins in the back, however the upstairs units are required to keep outdoor trash cans in this entry way area. The width of the trash cans is 29.75” leaving residents just an 18” gap to get into their homes. The HOAs response so far has been if you don’t like it you can leave the community (residents own the units). The majority of units are occupied by elderly individuals with mobility problems and while not only does leaving trash in the entry way of a home welcome pests carrying disease, but it also impedes those trying to get in and out of their units most of which have mobility issues. Do I have a case here, and is it worth procuring a lawyer?

"Contractor or State Employee? My friend is a contractor in MD working for the state.

She pays self employment taxes (15.3%)  and state and federal income tax.The offer is $36/hour to become an employee doing the same job.I don’t know if I am calculating this correctly but she will pay 7.65% for Medicare and social security as an employee vice paying 15.3% like she does now.

"Car payment issues - what to do? I purchased a new car in June 2020. I now find myself in some financial issues due to a job loss and I'm not sure what is my best option.I owe 41k on the car and can at best sell it for private at 37k. (Don't have the remaining 4k to close the car contract, let alone buy another car)Is my only option to sell the car back to the dealer and get a lower model (which will probably cost me big time long term) or do I have another path?

"Are employers allowed to access private internet networks? Pretty much what the title says.My dad works for a banking institution and deals with sensitive information (credit card numbers, addresses, etc.). Since COVID, he permanently works from home, so he uses our network and a company-provided VPN for his work computer.Ever since he works from home, he’s had this paranoia that our network can be audited by his job, and since he has teenagers (myself included), you can assume the things that are being searched from our private devices. So, he kicked everyone off the internet so that our IP addresses remain spotless. (Which of course, makes no sense, since IP addresses only track geographic location, not browsing history.)My question is: do employers have the right to get access to a private network and do they have the right to obtain browsing history from private (non-work owned) devices?I tell my parents that employers can’t do that (nor would they care) but they do not believe me.",1

"Is it legal to secretly record audio of your coworkers in a private dental office? I’m having an issue with a coworker for a little over a year now. Our boss finally hired an HR department so my other coworkers are encouraging me to call them about emotional and verbal abuse as well as harassment.

However, this coworkers interrupted and said she has audio recordings of all of our encounters and conversations and supposed proof that she’s actually the victim. I live in Arizona where the laws are weird so I don’t now what to do. If she does have this audio, I believe it could potentially show just how bad our encounters are.

" can my boss read my private slack messages in real time?

We realized that every time we sent one another a private message on slack, his laptop's notification pinged. We tested this a bunch and there is no way it was a coincidence - each time we sent one, it immediately pinged.From my research, slack doesn't allow workplace admins/owners to view employee messages in real time, they would have to export the messages to read them.I haven't sent anything crazy over slack but I still feel kind of weird if he's reading them and would just like to know.Is it possible he's got some way to read our private messages as we send them?

" Sign-On Bonus payback “time” question Hi all - I worked for a company that gave me a $5k sign on bonus with a 2 year commitment in Ohio.

I want to do what’s right and pay them back, but unexpected medical bills popped up and I can’t pay right away.Since there was nothing in writing stating I have to pay them back in any time frame, how long do I have the right to pay them back?

"HR Question  Hello Reddit,I have a serious HR question. My current company where I work have a bad track record(Bad management, retention of worker ,etc.). But That not the issue I'm, facing. In our workplace we're expected to wear safety glasses and steel toe shoes. We have one employee(Money) who don't wear both of them in a daily basis. I have brought this up to HR but they only caught her once without safety glasses. They didn't check her shoe( black croc shoe with black sock). I understand that It would be hard for HR to check or monitor things because I work 2nd shift(10hr shift). Most of the HR would leave soon after we start. But this person is part of a clique/group in the company. This group is make up of Supervisor(King Kong), lead( John Doe, Lisa), Trainer(Moon) and worker(Money, Karen, Sally). The boss would cover them for taking excess break + smoke break, not wear safety equipment, clocking them out or fixing their time card. Recently I reported an employee to my Supervisor(King Kong). Let call this employee(Karen). Karen would purpose yell and talk loudly and make decision without the Lead(John Doe) Input or without talking to us about her changes. She would move people to train in different station because she feel like it. Even though she not a trainer or lead. My boss would take her side and said it's better to train everyone. But he didn't hold any meeting with the groups. I report on her(Karen) to Supervisor(King Kong) that I don't like her yelling. She would come up behind us and yell at us. It would cause me to Jump/Spook/Scare me. I told Supervisor(King Kong) today that we work with machine and heavy equipment. What If drop a 10 pound parts on my thigh, hand, feet's (That why we wear steel toe shoes). Also what If my hand were touching the machine. What If I got spook at that time and my hand get caught in the machine? After telling Supervisor(King Kong) this he had a long talk with Karen. But somehow Sally involve herself into this mess. Supervisor(King Kong) came back to me and told me that how she talk and act. So ignore her. Toward the end of today Karen and Sally would try to provoke me to get a reaction from me. What should I do? They're trying to retaliate and the boss is covering for them. I just want them to stop yelling so I won't get injured. Should I escalate this to HR if they do something funny?",0

"Work and Home related stress  I'll preface this by saying this is NOT a post about me going to HR to complain about my boss. I generally like her and when she's not stressed she's very approachable and open to ideas etc.Recently I've been under a lot of work and home stress. My father has a medical problem that is only going to get worse down the line and to be honest has gotten worse. I go to work and work.. and come home and help care for my father. I don't really get a lot of downtime.. this is made worse by the fact I actually never get to leave work on time. There's always so much work on my plate I never feel like I can just.. stop and go home when I'm supposed to otherwise I'll come in the next day to a load of emails asking why such and such hasn't been done and as someone who is trying their hardest and breaking their back doing it... it feels quite demoralising to constantly be picked up on things. Now the real problem at work is the fact I love my job.. but that should be me doing MY job.. instead I'm doing the work of AT LEAST 2 people and occasionally 3.. which is leading to me not enjoying my job. I'm very overworked in the fact someone's gone on maternity cover and work weren't even going to get maternity cover to my knowledge so I had no backup or support in my role (the person on maternity is my senior.. I don't report to them but they're the senior version of my job so I can usually get help with a variety of tasks around the office and they can pick up things I forget or can't get round to and vice versa.) Eventually they've had to as the person will be leaving shortly after their maternity leave has finished. This person isn't starting for another month and I've already been by myself in my role (new to my role, I've only been in the company a few months.) for most of my time there. I'm picking up the job of 2 people and they've got rid of every bit of minor help I did have.. they got a temp in but as he wasn't proactive in doing things they decided they weren't worth keeping on for long, they got rid of daytime security who helped me with a few more physical jobs around the office (the office is HUGE so stocking everywhere up is a really big task..). And one of the team who was around to help me out sometimes is now trialling another role half of the week so won't be around to help me as much. All the small support I did have.. they've got rid of when I was already lacking support anyway unlike the other new receptionist at our sister office who has a senior AND help everyday from someone to get things done around the office..I'm trying not to be angry about it, but I'm new in a job and they've basically taken away all the support I did have and now I'm extremely overworked and I can't even relax when I get home because of my dad. I literally never switch off. I'm sick of getting emails telling me things I've missed or not done.. I feel like I've been set up for failure and everytime I tell my manager I'm stressed I get told I'm a trooper or I'm doing really well.. but then the emails telling me about things I've missed constantly make me feel otherwise. I got upset because I got told off about some fruit being left out for 2 days in a place it shouldn't have been.. when plenty of other people who were in our department walked past the fruit where it was and could have just moved it..?I have scheduled a meeting in with HR to talk about things.. but I want advice on how to approach the whole situation for the best possible outcome. I'm not here to point fingers but I am here to get some serious solutions before I burn out from being overworked due to lack of support in my role.. a lack of support that wasn't there until the past couple of months. I'm so stressed I sometimes just feel like I could burst into tears at work.. which in turn is affecting my physical health now too.",0

Today, I was working from home and he sent me a text asking me to help out a family member with an issue that my department deals with. There is nothing inherently unethical about the request in my line of work. However, I don’t want to answer the text because I don’t feel comfortable corresponding with my ex out of work about personal matters, and I’d prefer not to get involved in his family stuff even if the family member could potentially be a “customer” of my company (sorry to be vague about the nature of the business but I am trying to keep things as anonymous as possible). HR managers — is it wrong to ignore this text? Or should I politely tell him I would prefer not to get involved? TIA!",0
"Airbnb host agreed to refund the cleaning fee but now the host and airbnb won't give the refund I booked an Airbnb for a few nights. After the cancelation date, I found someone who could host me for free closer to the area I wanted to be in. The day of my check in I told the host that I won't be staying there and if she would refund the cleaning fee. She agreed that after she gets paid she would refund it if I do not stay in the place. I never stayed in the place and waited for the refund to come.I reached out to airbnb to find out whats going on and with screenshots of the chat where the host agreed to send the refund. Airbnb tells me that they need to confirm with the host. The host confirmed but said she changed her mind because of the inconvenience and will not refund the cleaning fee.I told airbnb that the host or airbnb needs to abide by the written agreement. Airbnb is not willing to help. Am I in the wrong here? Is there something I should to get a refund?",1
"How do optimize taxes when selling mutual funds? BLUF: I want to sell some of my assets, which are mainly mutual funds, but I don't think I want to use a average cost basis. What do I need to consider moving forward?Basically I have mutual funds like most everybody else that I buy into a little bit here and there throughout the year. I have some in an IRA Roth and some in just a plain brokerage account (not IRA). My understanding is when I sell some funds from the brokerage account, tax is computed on the capital gains based on an average cost basis. That will include how much of the asset I'm selling and when those shares were purchased. I believe there's a drop off in taxes on capital gains if held for longer than a year, long-term capital gains. So what I would like to do is to sell some of the assets I bought over a year ago to reduce the capital gains tax I will pay.Example: I bought 10 shares of VTSAX January 2020. Then I bought another 10 shares in January of 2021. I believe vanguard allows you to change the cost basis from an average method to another method. Does that help, or make a difference, if you sell 10 shares out of the 20 share pot, or separate the pot into the two purchase events, and sell only the shares older than one year?2) For the Roth IRA, My understanding is that I could separate the money I contributed and the money earned from capital gains. I can do the separation in the account and sell only my contribution portion, which should not be taxed because they are not capital gains. Thus, The account would have in cash, all the money I can contributed, and all the money in capital gains would be held as stock or mutual funds inside the Roth IRA. Is there anything wrong with this thinking? The motivation is that in times of market instability, I can sell my Roth contributions to hold in cash in the Roth account to hedge my losses on the capital gains in the account if the market goes down. Note: I will not be taking any disbursement from the Roth account. Only moving the money from a mutual fund to a settlement account (money market) inside the Roth account.",2
"Shopify f1 student Hi everyone, I am an international student living in California, and I wondered if there was any way for a student with an F1 visa to start an open business online.

" Hiring spree before an acquisition. Why? My current employer went on a massive hiring spree adding atleast 100 people in few months. I'd just joined the team last month and noticed most employees were quiet quitters and unenthusiastic. I was a red flag but i ignored that and continued with my work. Currently one month after I'd joined the company, the CEO sends an email about being acquired by a public company. He says that there won't be any changes in payrolls or designation but the HR says later we'd consolidate. The acquiring company is a digital transformation company so it most likely won't reduce headcount in engineering teams.

Dad wants me to create a separate checking account in my name for him to use He is asking to create a separate checking account at a bank where I don't have a checking account so that he can hide his cash from his wife before he file for divorce. His wife created a lot of credit card debt while he doesn't have debt any under his name. Plus they share a mortgage. He consulted with a divorce lawyer and found out they would have to share the debt when they separate. So that is why he is wanting to hide his assets under my name.I don't mind creating a checking account but don't want to run into legal issues down the road. Would there be problems in the future if I do this for him?Edit: I'm in the U.S and we are both adults (over age 18). His wife is not my mother and not my guardian,1

" Is this normal? Scope of work is going beyond that I expected, pay is still the same (agriculture) For context, I work in viticulture. As it is, we generally do a lot of non-agricultural warehouse and winery work in addition to vineyard work, like filling and labelling bottles, operating wine pumps, taking gravity readings, chaptalizing, etc. Since we're technically ""agricultural workers"", we don't get paid overtime for this, even during the harvest season when we regularly work 50-70 hours.On its own, this is a little iffy since the legal precedent in our area defines agricultural work as the cultivation, handling, sorting, packaging, and preparation of produce for market. That being said, I'm not sure how the law considers processed foods like wine in the equation, and whether the duties we perform fall under that definition.Our harvest season has recently ended, so my boss has had us doing pretty much exclusively non-ag work (putting away the season's equipment, organizing the warehouse, etc.) I was even brought along to haul stuff out of his basement one day, which was admittedly a little weird.He's also recently acquired a neighboring estate, and decided to start renovating the house there to rent out (which must have been built sometime in the 50's). Obviously he needed some muscle to tear it up, so we were called on to help.Honestly I wouldn't even mind the odd jobs if there wasn't the potential of a health hazard and I was paid accordingly. The work is fun and engaging (though the pay is obviously garbage). It's just started to seem much less worthwhile, with the possibility of exposure to lead paint, asbestos wallpaper, mold, all that good stuff. I brought a respirator and P100s from home, but he only really offered construction grade filter masks and one communal respirator to the other guys :(It's also frustrating that our compensation hasn't changed despite our versatility, essentially transitioning to house-flipping contractors.I guess I'm mostly curious about people's thoughts on how to navigate growing companies still acting a bit ""small"" in how they operate and manage.

" Question about a statement from a former employer I have a question about obtaining a statement from a former employer. I am currently in the review process to be licensed for what I do in a different state, and as a part of that process I had to state that I was fired from my previous position. That in itself is not a problem for licensure, but it has triggered further investigation.The licensure board is now requiring that a statement be sent directly to them from my former employer. I'm concerned about this because my former supervisor and I did not part on good terms. I only held the job for two months or so, so I was still within the probationary period for new employees and didn't have access to any conflict resolution options within HR. To be clear, I never broke any laws or company policies - this was an issue of fit and personality conflict.How do I go about requesting this statement? I don't know what kind of language to use. Even if I go through HR and leave my former supervisor out of it completely, I'm concerned that they will say something that will get my licensure denied.Thank you for any help or guidance you can provide!",0

"Question about spousal maintenance in Colorado I have been married to my wife for 11 years. She now wants a divorce out of a combination of ""loss of love"", mid-life crisis, and emotional affair (not that the reasons matter in Colorado).Up until March 2021, I had been the primary breadwinner up until that point, though my wife periodically also held lower-paying jobs to help supplement our income. By March 2021, my income was approximately $98,000/yr. In the two years leading up to that point, she had taken a much more active role in developing a career, including us paying for multiple trainings and certifications, etc. For a time she held two ""full-time"" WFH jobs to maximize her income and experience. In March 2021, she was recruited by a startup in her field for a position much higher than her current one, with lots of growth potential, and double my income. This job would require her to focus on it exclusively for probably 12-14 hours a day, I had been fighting with my boss (the CEO of my then-current employer) and, talking about working on a side-project business, etc. The convenience of the increased income, the need for me to take care of the kids and the house, and the opportunity to spend more time on my side-project made for a great opportunity.In April of 2022, my wife went through an executive coaching program that cost $10,000.  She now tells me that that program made her realize she wanted a divorce, but that she had to think about it until now. Now she wants a divorce, and thinks that she does not have to pay spousal maintenance to me, even though I quit my career to support hers, take care of the kids, etc. Yes, it was convenient for me at the time, but that only worked when I thought we were working together toward a common goal.She says an attorney she talked to said that she did not have to pay spousal maintenance since I could get a job. Setting aside the fact that my side-project is now at the point that within the next six months we should have major pre-seed venture capital, and I have to abandon all that if I went back to work, the attorney I spoke to said that she would have to pay spousal maintenance, since I quit my job to support hers, notwithstanding the additional benefit I got of not having to deal with my boss any more or being able to work on my side-project.A couple of weeks ago she told me that I wouldn't have to worry about spousal maintenance, which I assumed meant that she was just going to go with the formula. However, tonight she said something about how she was volunteering to support me, and that I should be more helpful with the divorce process (I'm not impeding, I'm just not shouldering any of the work of the divorce - she wants it, not me). I told her that was generous, but that she had to pay spousal maintenance anyway, whether or not I do all the work of processing the divorce. That's when it came out that it was her impression that she did not have to because I had the ability to get a job.Is anyone familiar with Colorado divorce law who can help clarify this for me please?",1

If you’re interested in the details I would be more than happy to share because it’s actually pretty terrible. I’ve shared the issue with other people and all have suggested I leave because it seems like I am being micromanaged and bullied.I went through the organizations employee handbook and it says that there are steps an employee needs to take in order to be released from their contract. It says that the organization will only “attempt” to accommodate this request by recommending release providing the following guidelines are followed:• The employee MUST inform his/her coordinator that they are investigating other employment opportunities at the time the process begins• The employee must keep the supervisor up-to-date during the process. This information includes all relevant information such as school systems involved, interview dates, and possible timetables.•At the appropriate time, the employee must submit a letter of resignation to the superintendent or chief of Human Resources & talent office with the proposed termination date.• “X” benefits will end date of termination or with non-renewals end of contractI am confused because it seems like it is not as simple as giving a 2 weeks notice which the handbook says is required. So let’s say I haven’t been looking for other jobs. Can I just submit the two weeks notice? I do not have a teaching contract with this organization. It says that anyone with a teaching contract cannot accept a job in another public school district unless you are properly released from your contract. I asked Human Resources to send me a copy of my contract and they responded via email that we do not have actual contracts.It also says “all employees are encouraged not to leave during the fiscal year, however, a two-week notice is required upon resignation to assure re-hire status. No employee will be released until a suitable replacement is found.”I would appreciate any advice or support for this. Thank you!",0
"Was the rise of 401(k)s a boost to the stock market? And has that boost evaporated? I'm not an economics or finance person.  This is mostly just a shower thought that I was unable to answer with a few minutes of googling so I figured I'd ask here:In my mind, for the first couple centuries or so of US stock markets, stocks were bought and sold by traditional investors (institutions and savvy and/or rich individuals).  I'll call that the Classical Era.The Early 401(k) Era seems like a sea change to me - starting in the late 70s and then really picking up in the early 80s, money poured into the stock market on behalf of a huge number of American workers.  With every payroll, institutions would buy, buy, buy on behalf of 401(k) holders.  Certainly there was some selling, but relatively little, especially early on as there hadn't been time for large 401(k) balances to accumulate.  Coincidentally(?), the stock market (from glancing at a chart or 2) appears to have performed better from 1980-date than over most time periods.Now it seems to me that perhaps we're hitting the 401(k) Equilibrium Era, where money continues to pour into the market on behalf of workers, but there are also now plenty of 401(k) retirees selling constantly as well.Is it reasonable to think that the Early 401(k) Era was a ""turbo boost"" for the market, but in the 401(k) Equilibrium Era we might expect future stock market returns to look more like in the Classical Era?",2

"Is it blackmail or extortion if I offer not to report a crime provided they pay back money I previously lent them? Long and convoluted story, I’ll try and spark notes it as best I can.We were friends and roommates in CA. He fell on hard times, and I started helping him out financially (was kind of forced to as he stopped paying his half of the rent) provided he paid me back. For a while, he was paying me back on a regular basis.Then we had an argument, and he stopped both paying me back and speaking to me. The living situation was extremely contentious, so I spoke to the landlord and they let me out of the lease and I moved out on my own. I tried to pursue a small claims against him for the money owed (I have texts etc that confirm I lent him money and he had agreed to pay it back) but it became too difficult to serve him when I didn’t know where he was living and talking to an attorney the amount it would have cost me to hire someone wouldn’t have netted me that much even if we won (the original amount was about $20k, he paid back about half so he still owes ~10k). Eventually, I gave up and moved on.Fast forward like 3 years, I now live in New York and was checking my credit and found a soft inquiry for what looks like an apartment rental application in Texas (which is where we met as colleagues, though we both left in ~2016 to move to CA). So it looks like he may have forged my signature to co-sign his rental application.My thought process is to reach out to him, confirm that he actually did use my signature, and remind him that he still owes me 10k and that forgery is a crime. If he resumes paying me what I lent him, and promises never to use my name like that again, I won’t report the forgery as a crime.Obviously, IANAL so the quid pro quo part of it makes me uncomfortable that it could be considered blackmail or extortion. Am I potentially putting myself in hot water by offering not to report the crime if he pays me back what I lent him?Thanks",1

"Why do funds/banks/corporations invest in tax credit opportunities when they end up spending more than they save? Why do corporations avoid paying tax? From my understanding, if a company profits $100, spending the $100 provides $100 in value rather than $79 in value if the same amount is taxed and then spent.Why do corporations invest in tax credits like low income housing or historic buildings??? The historic tax credit is 39% but the company still has to spend $100 to bring in $39 of credits which seems like a clear negative ROI. What am I missing?",2
My friend isn’t receiving his PTO after quitting when i did. So like the title says my friend and I both worked at AMC theatres for 3 years and recently we both quit. I happen to quit first and my GM approached me and asked me if I wanted my PTO paid out I said yes so in my last check I got my remaining PTO paid out.Now my friend quit about a month after I did and he emailed them asking if he could also get paid out and the same GM told him that he couldn’t do that due to a policy but he did it for me the month prior and proceeded to send my friend a policy about PTO in NY but it provides information on how sick hours are accrued and how they are used but doesn't place any limitations on being paid out upon leaving the company. And I asked several people who left around the same time I did if they got their PTO paid out and they’ve all said no and that none of them even got asked. So now I have a couple of questions.What would be the PTO payout laws in my state (we live in NY)Are there any AMC rules that say we can’t be paid out once we leave the company. and 3. is there anything legal we could do for our GM playing favorites and only offering me the opportunity to cash out my PTO but making difficult for others to do so?https://www.ny.gov/new-york-paid-sick-leave/new-york-paid-sick-leave and this is the link our GM sent to my friend,1

"Proving clear and present danger without being allowed to record Someone described a problem with gun violence threats at home.

I found out that Illinois has a red flag law where you can petition the police to take away the firearm of a family member if you can prove they are a clear and present danger to yourself or others. To me, this seems straightforward: record them next time they pull out the gun and point it at someone.

However, Illinois also has some of the most punitive recording consent laws in the country to the point of a child getting charged with a felony for recording his interaction with the principal while in the principals office.

So I'm just obsessively curious right now...

How on earth is someone supposed to prove a clear and present danger with gun threats is occurring in the privacy of the home if its a greater legal offense to record someone without their consent while they're threatening you with a gun??

" Promotion/Raise Shifting Goalposts I’ve been working at a University that is the largest employer in our region for 10 years. I work in clinical research support. I’ve been there the longest of my peer work group. I’ve always received top reviews, and my boss has always remarked how invaluable I am. My skillset includes quite a bit of learned and institutional knowledge that would be hard to replace. I love my work group and have great interactions with my peers.For the past few years, my boss has wanted to promote me, to recognize the added duties I’ve taken on and to help me grow in my career (my last promotion was in 2018). I requested that we push back the promotion during the height of the pandemic, as I wanted to focus on my current duties (often involving 12 hour days) and to hopefully be in a better position for a raise when the University wasn’t freezing expenditures.My boss has been working over the past year with HR to push my promotion through. For several months, the updates I received were that HR was just finalizing the last steps and it was on the last desk for sign off. A few months ago, my boss told me that she was trying to raise my job title two levels through the promotion. I was later told that HR refused to allow that. A little over a month ago, my boss told me that everything was nearly finalized and that my promotion would come with a 15% raise (she expressed that she had been trying for more than that).Today I touched base with my boss, as I’ve been feeling strung along by HR. She told me that she was trying to fix things, but that HR had come back and refused to allow the 15% raise, as it would make me the highest paid person in my job classification in my department. She told me the latest range would be an 8-10% increase. She said that she would call new people at HR and try to fight for me.I’ve been thinking about the situation, and honestly, I’m discouraged by the resistance and shifting goalposts from HR, especially as my boss has been the one fighting for me. As much as I love my work group, this resistance from HR is just adding to my burnout from the pandemic. I’m planning on talking to my boss to tell her that while I haven’t made any decisions, I am considering exploring the job market to see what salaries my skills and experience can get me. I know another department at the University has already informally offered me more than I would make with a 10% raise. I love my job, but I also have to think about my future.Is it a mistake to talk to my boss about my disappointment and discuss my thoughts about entering the job market again? Also, have you ever heard of HR departments pushing back so much when a supervisor is on board with a raise and promotion? Do you have any other advice on my next steps forward?Thanks!",0

"Hypothetical of co-owning a mortgage Hi Ask finance,Sorry if this isn't in the right subreddit, but figured more finance savvy people would be able to provide a better answer.My partner and I were having a hypothetical discussion and would like your input.Two parties A and B decide to buy a house together 50/50 split. So each party owns 50% of the house and also pay 50% of the mortgage each. This was always seen as an investment property for party A and party B gets to live in the house.I believe this isn't a fair contract because of the following reasons:Party A is paying for a house with no additional benefits where party B gets all the same benefits as party A but with the addition of a roof over their head making it already imbalanced.Total accommodation price is lower for party B as they don't need to rent another house or pay a 2nd mortgage like party A does.Both parties don't gain any income from renting out the house to a third party, so party A looses money there. Where as party B is neural as they benefit accommodation wise, but also equally loose out on no additional income from a renter.My partner believes that it is a fair contract for the following reasons:Because this was always seen as an investment property for party A, they never had the intention to live in it.Party A gets an investment property, regardless of who is living in the house. So in the long run, both parties will gain money once the house is sold down the track.Party A gets a foothold into property investing for less than paying 100% upfront (for a mortgage) due to sharing the cost (and might not have been able to afford the investment property themselves).",2

" Manager is Confiding Suicidal Thoughts to Employee (me) TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts.My job started a week and a half before we were all sent home for COVID two and half years ago or so. She is the bottleneck for communication with the company, and we have many issues and incompatibilities, but she's a nice person and so I have not been good about work boundaries (I have my own mental health stuff and non-confrontation challenges).Her health has been deteriorating this entire time resulting in her having to take a lot of time off. Recently, in venting her frustration about her health she mentioned that it's bad enough that she wished she could just kill herself.

" COMP OFF Vs Overtime Vs Nothing Hi all, I work as a software engineer for a large investment bank in the united states. However, I am not hired directly by the bank but rather by a contractor (hourly exempt) that basically takes a cut from my pay. They provide no PTO at all so any day or rather hours that I don't work, I don't get paid.Usually on some Fridays we have work that extend anywhere from 3 to 4 hours past my shift, when I extended and logged those hours as extra hours in my timesheet my boss was not happy and said that we usually like to keep total hours at 40 hours a week.Now this is about to happen again next week so I consulted with him what he wants me to do in case I had to extend to finish work ... He said the most odd thing.He said log in normally at 9 ... Work for 4 hours ... Take 3 to 4 hour break mid day and then log in to continue to work (assuming that work will extend another 4 hours) so I end up with 8 work hours that day, even though I started at 9 and will likely finish at 9.Two problems here.This is very crappy and inconvenient, and possibly illegal.What if work finishes on time and I don't even have to extend at the end of the day ... I would log out at 6 PM and end up only working 5 or 6 hours ?!!They don't wanna approve overtime for my contractor to pay me for it ... And when I said I can accumulate these hours from many weeks and use them for time off since I don't have PTO he also said that's not allowed ... Ideally I should try to keep my hours at 40 hours a week ...But somehow he manages to expect me to do the late work .. so it's ok to take unpaid break during the day cuz there are other people there .. hut at the end of the day where only one or two people will work I have to be there.",0

I have taken time off work, right after it happened I took like a week off. But the thing is I am not better. I have tried so hard to just be normal and I can't do it. I struggle every day with just existing after it happened, but honestly my job is one of the only things I care about. I'm so good at my job. I take a lot of pride in that. But now it's come to the point where I fight with depressive thoughts daily. I went to like 2 therapy appointments over the last 13ish months, I just thought I could fix it. But I can't fix it.Is there a way to claim FMLA without current medical records? It's been quite a while since I went to a doctor/therapist, but I can't fix this. And honestly just going to work and logging in would be enough to keep those issues at bay, but I can't do it anymore. I need help but also don't want to lose my only source of income.I dunno if this is the right place to post this, so yeah sorry if it's not.",0

"Need help Hello. I have a question and don’t know if anyone can help. Long story short. I hooked up with a guy  and got pregnant 1 month in. I didn’t even really know much about him. The more I found out the more I decided us dating just wasn’t going to work. He tried to fit a year worth of relationship in that month. Like saying “I love you”, “put me on your phone plan” “let’s move in”. I have a few kids. They are well behaved and very sweet. He also has a few kids but they are the complete opposite. They get introuble for smoking weed, playing with guns, vulgar. The list goes on. I am really worried that this baby will end up like his others. Can I use the stuff I know to keep the baby from living with him. Idc for supervised visits or what not. I just want to prevent another one turning out like them.",1
"Why is it suddenly legal for Google/Anroid to spy on phone calls ?

"What are my chances in a contractor dispute? Homeowner here who has been planning a bath remodel for a year, and waiting almost as long due to pandemic delays. The time has finally arrived, and now that we’re at the plumbing rough-in stage, the sub has decided he needs $5k more to do the work, as it’s “more complicated and higher-tech than I expected”. That’s almost a 20% bump in the total bid, and way more than I’m willing to pay. My case is that: A) been working with the GC for a year on this, he knows the project well (he’s now claiming he didn’t know I was buying high-end stuff that’s more precise to install) and B) I have emails with responses from him to my questions such as, “this is a fancy, complicated spa-like install, are you sure this quote includes that” because it was vague) a year ago when I signed.  He responded both affirmatively to the complexity (ceiling rain shower, body sprays and separate hand shower) and separately to the quote being valid for it. C) the contractor (should call him GC I suppose) confirmed with me that the plumbing sub can come on-site last Friday to finalize the bid. Someone came, didn’t see who, the GC’s super handled it. As far as I can tell they only looked at the installation site, as they didn’t go to the garage where the parts are. D) Tuesday of this week plumbing was supposed to start; two kids showed up 90 minutes late. I showed them to the job, and they said, “wow, too complicated for us, our boss said he’ll be out to do this on Thursday”. E) today the “boss” was here for 3 hours (also 90 minutes late) reading instruction books that came with the valves and decided he was underbid, and whelp?Here we are. Nothing installed, and my GC is withholding work until we “iron out” the pricing. My POV is that we’ve done that, and I have evidence to support that. He hung up on me, so I know I’m on the right side, but if I have to take him to court (contract is $32k, so not small claims I think?) to finish the work, do I have good enough chances to start seeking legal representation now? I don’t think we’ll reach an agreement otherwise; unless you think I’m being unreasonable?

"Medical malpractice? Hi everyone, in the state of OR. Went at the beginning of august to get a calcium deposit removed by a derm surgeon. I asked them to keep the stitches in longer as I’m immunocompromized and know I take longer to heal. Was ignored and stitches came out after 2 weeks. The wound opened up and has been open since. Follow up with the derm concluded with him telling me to use nonstick pads and antibiotic ointment. Finally talked to my primary who ordered wound care and both nurses who have looked at the wound said his instructions were not the best and recommended I see a different derm.

" Reasonable Accommodation, medical termination, disability retirement? Lots of questions below, hoping someone has answers.I don't trust my leadership; they are only out for themselves and don't care about employees. It's a toxic work environment and it has affected my health. Anyhow, I ask these questions here because my ""chain of command"" are not there to help nor guide. They barely do their own work, so I have little expectation from their end. Anyhow...As a federal employee & a service-connected veteran, I've been on intermittent FMLA+leave all year (as I've done for the last 5yrs). It's been worse this year so I was out more often and now I've used up my FMLA before renewal time, and I'm out of leave. Since my leadership needed bodies/coverage this year, I would do remote-work to help and they've had me to work from home since March.With my FMLA running out for the year, I applied for Reasonable Accommodation (RA) in early Sept to continue doing remote work since I have issues being out of my home. My doctor provided their letter, and everything's done on my end. My leadership claims they don't have remote work available, even though I've been doing just that for them most of the year since they needed coverage. (Leadership lied to the RA and stated I hadn't worked all year, until I mentioned that I had paystubs & everything I do requires secure access/logs, proving I've been working from home all this time. Freaking jerks... See why I don't trust my leadership??)Anyways, they weren't able to find me a position that works with my reasonable accommodation, and so I'm at the stage where I have to sign an ""Employee Limitations on Reassignment Options"" form so they can continue looking for a position I can do, even if the position pays less, is in another location, part-time instead of full time, etc. (They have 40 days from the time I sign the form.) What I found odd was that the RA stated that if they couldn't find anything, I'd be ""removed from federal gov't"". I assume she meant medical termination, but that's not what her notification states.Meanwhile, I'd be on Leave Without Pay for the duration. I've already been without pay since Sept, and now I'm gonna continue being without income for the next 40 days..? I can't afford letting my mortgage go like that, or any of the other bills.What is a medical termination? How does that affect future employment?What are my options at this point? I didn't want to sign the form without knowing what I'd be signing away.And what happens if they can't find a position and the 40 days are up? What then?And ""removed from federal govt"" meaning what exactly, I can't get a job at all with the govt even if it's a different agency?And during this 40-day period, can I accept employment from elsewhere so I'm not broke/homeless, at least until I hear back from them? (I have a feeling they won't find a position for me.)Will being able to find employment elsewhere hurt my case any, even if the job is remote/work-from-home per my Reasonable Accommodation request?",0
"Does an employer need to pay out 2 week notice after telling employee not to come in once notice was received?  My wife was the Baker at a local cafe, she gave her two weeks notice last weekend and her boss showed up at our door within an hour to berate her and take their key back. Her boss gave her a 15minute speech about how giving her 2 weeks notice was not fair since they have 3 small kids and that this is a small town so word will get around and impact the business my wife is trying to grow for herself. They said they don't want her to work another shift for them.The husband of this boss then proceeded to text my wife the next day with 7 paragraphs of shit talking down to her and saying she should have provided multiple months of notice.These people are very shady business operators who like to skirt regular rules (such as not paying their staff for stat days) and manipulate the staff. Which is funny since their day jobs are as a cop and the other is in the military.My wife hasn't heard yet on whether they will be paying her out for these final 2 weeks.Is there any guidance that anyone can provide?They intimidate her with the way they talk and will likely try to not pay her the final 2 weeks so I wanted to see what her options would beShe has been employed by them since Def 2022 if that means anything and her employment contract dictated a 2 week notice would be mandatory (for which she provided)Side note, she also completely created the menu for baked goods and has shared these recipes with them thru a Google doc for which she is the document owner.

"What are my options for gaining legal ownership of a house? I know the title sounds a bit misleading but, I'll explain. Through a bunch of super petty family politics, my grandmother left her son (my uncle) her home when she passed away. He lives on the other side of the country and visits maybe once a year, if that.  My mother and brother (daughter and grandson of the original owner) live there currently and have for about 5-6 years. They pay all the bills and taxes on the house, and it is their legal address. Additionally, my uncle has organized several upgrades to the house over the years, such as a new roof, new paint, and and updated bathroom, and my mom and brother have repaid him for all expenses.My question is this- is there anything stopping my uncle from waiting until the house has been totally renovated on my mom's and brother's dime, then kicking them out and selling the house for his own profit? He has been reluctant to discuss transferring the deed, and always changes the subject when any of us press it. I just wondered if living there for a length of time or paying the property taxes gave us any sway when it came to taking ownership, assuming he refuses to sign it over.Thanks in advance!",1

"Buying a house without our agent involved, just wondering what steps to take. We had put an offer up for a previous house and lost because not only did our agent tell us to do an FHA and the sellers preferred conventional, when they asked her if we could switch, she never brought that to our attention. The selling realtor called us to tell us because he was really disappointed in her representation of us and he wanted us to know. We did initially put an offer through her on the house we just won the bid on, if that’s relevant. The home owner called us and told us she didn’t even remember our names when trying to put in our offer. The homeowner actually took our contract we signed when putting in the offer on the first house we lost to her friend who’s a lawyer and he said it’s not viable for three reasons. 1.) there’s no date from when we signed 2.) there’s no counties listed for where the contract covers 3.) she had no involvement of us finding the house, communicating with the owners and touring the house, she just put the offer, which was denied and then we put in a separate one without her. We were going to put the house in my name as well because my fiancé is the one that signed the contract with the realtor. Does this situation require us to call and fire her? She basically never reaches out trying to send us homes anyways and she doesn’t even know our names apparently.

"Withholding my application?  Hello,I am working at a legal non-profit in SF,  . I had been working there as a legal interviewer since Feb 2022. Recently, an old co-worker from my immigration law non-profit sent me a posting for a coordinator position in my same company and even same department (just a different team). It essentially was a job that I was highly qualified for and something that I would throughly enjoy doing. I spoke with my supervisors and they encouraged me to apply. I then sent my resume and cover letter to HR in October 2022.HR had responded after a bit and had asked if she could call me and speak with me without a lot of details. We spoke and she essentially stated that I couldn't apply since I had not been at the company for at least a year. She then proceeded to ask me if I disliked the position that I was in currently, I rejected the idea as it wasn't true. She then said just so you know the pay is lateral and I assured her that I did not mind. I expressed that I was sent the position from a co-worker from the same field as the position and she was surprised as she thought I was looking to move on my own. She stated that she just wanted to be consistent and kept emphasizing the pay. I expressed that it was a shame that I couldn't apply, since I had worked with the team before and I knew them from my position.I was just wondering if this was appropriate and if I would be able to talk with her about the process. When I spoke to my supervisors of the situation they were also confused as it is the same department and stated that they should have at least allowed me to apply. Please let me know what I could do.

"$40,000 and an EVIL Babies Mama... Am I fucked? So my father died when I was 24 years old and in his will he left both my sister and I each $175,000 but in the will he stated that I was NOT to receive the money until I turned 40 years old. Well my sister gave it to me anyways because she was in charge of all that stuff and didn't want to deal with it.Long story short, I was dating a woman who had my baby and we had a verbal contract stating that if I gave her $40,000 then she would stop claiming child support on me. (She tricked me into letting her claim child support while she was living in a duplex with me while I worked and paid the rent). I owed like only $2000 when I got the money and she said that she would stop claiming child support but all she did was go down to the Child Support Office and told them that I no longer lived at my address and she had no idea where I was at, so I stopped receiving the bills in the mail stating that I owed this amount of child support so I believed she stopped claiming itWell later when I was broke I had overpaid the Child Support Office one time when the last letter I got stated I owed $2000 and I got a letter stating I overpaid by $1500 and I could go down to the office and get my check, well... When I went down there they said ""yeah you did overpay us but she never stopped claiming... so as of now you owe $5000+ dollars, do you want us to credit the $1500 to the amount that you owe?""So my question is...

" Intern seems oblivious to professional norms and it's hurting his job search and burning bridges everywhere At my organization, I'm partly in charge of a man who's near halfway through his year-long paid internship with us.  He's not performing well and has alienated almost everyone, and the direct feedback we've been giving him doesn't seem to be making much impact.  Here are some reasons why:- he is given a list of tasks to do and instructions for how to do them, but he ignores these tasks and claims he was never told about them.- he is not a considerate officemate.  I have received a lot of feedback from people who sit near him that he is extremely loud, talks on his phone for hours in his native language while sitting at his desk, and isn't mindful that others need to do work (their roles are such that they cannot wear noise-canceling headphones while doing their jobs)- he doesn't respect his higher-ups.  My industry is pretty hierarchical, with deference expected while interfacing with people above you in the org chart.  He will knock on higher-ups' office doors or walk right in, ask if they have five minutes for a quick question, and proceed to talk on and on until he is asked to leave, about a range of topics that, frankly, he should be researching for himself.  He does this to me often.  I have stopped him and told him it's not a good time, and ask him to come back at a specific time later in the day, which he does not do.  Even when I send him a calendar invite for later in the day and he accepts it, he still won't show up at the appointed time, and does not apologize when I next see him.This man was born and raised outside the US and is on a temporary visitor visa in the US.  In order to stay in the US after his visa ends, he will need a full-time job offer by an employer who is willing to sponsor him (at much cost to them) to eventually get a green card.  As it happens, we have an internal opening in our organization, which he interviewed for, but due to his performance so far, he will not be hired.  So, he has been interviewing externally, and while there's a lot of demand for his skill set, he's had no offers.  He will come talk to me after almost every interview and complain about the slightest things -- how someone made an offhand remark that offended him, how one of his interviewers told him that the role was quite busy and he didn't like that, how he didn't like that he had to interview with a specific person and he complained to the person organizing the interview about this (!!!), how a hiring manager asked him to meet her at a Starbucks for a preliminary conversation prior to a formal interview day and he felt that was inappropriate, how a hiring manager tried to sell him a job by talking about the generous compensation and he didn't like that (!!!), etc.  I have been listening patiently and offering impartial advice.  I have also tried to be very frank with him that no job is perfect, especially not the very first job you get right out of internship training, and that his visa status may be a hindrance for some employers.  As the months drag by and he continues having apparently negatively experiences everywhere he interviews, it's clear he's not taking my advice on board, and he's probably showing up to them the same way he's showing up to us -- basically, making a poor impression and torching his chances of getting hired anywhere.My industry is pretty small, and I've heard unofficially from some other colleagues at different organizations that he's indeed not interviewing well and turning people off.  I've also heard indirectly that his references from other organizations are not giving him good reviews.  (Thankfully, he has not asked me to be a reference for him -- and I do not think I could be, in good conscience.)I'm struggling with how to manage this situation going forward.  Any resources for how to instill professionalism and self-awareness into someone like this, since direct and pointed feedback isn't working?   (Sadly, I don't have the authority to put him on a PIP or terminate him -- the person who hired him is very unlikely to be on board with either of these plans.)  I'm also worried about my own professional reputation in this small industry, in the high likelihood that he won't change if/when he finds a full-time job and burns bridges at his next organization too.",0

" Need help with management! My manager presented me with documentation of a meeting we had and requested I sign it. The document included the statement ""Fwoggy7 suffers from anxiety and week commencing 10th of October had been stressful for personal medical issues. These anxiety issues were disclosed prior to starting this role in job and were stated to be under control, however observations have shown that this is not the case."". After reading the document I stated that I disagreed with this implication that my anxiety disorder is out of control and explained that it is as under control as it can be, also disclosing that I have completed a course of medication and talking therapy as proof of this. By stating my disagreement and explaining why I disagreed I had expected the statement to be removed, however management disagreed with me, accused me of lying about the reason for my sickness absence the week prior (my fiance had covid and I had all the symptoms but negative lat flows, she said that she believes it was anxiety related) and disregarded what I had said. Instead she chose to make an addition mentioning that I have had therapy. She then asked if I would like anything changing and, as I had already stated that I was unhappy with a statement and was shut down, I said no because I felt that pushing the matter would have negative repercussions. I felt like this because in the morning huddle that day she had made a point of thanking two other staff members who had also been sick for persevering and asking after their wellbeing whilst ignoring myself, then proceeding to accuse me of lying about my sickness later in the day. I signed the document because I felt pressured and like I had no other choice because I feared repercussions if I didn't. I planned to raise this with a higher up manager the next day. She failed to mention in the document that she was a cause of a lot of stress due to the fact that she threatened me with a transfer during the meeting. She used the words ""You will not lose your job because of this but I will transfer you because I cannot use you."" and told me that she would find me a suitable job in the labs. She was aware of this fact, as I had made her aware and she informed me that I ""must must must stop worrying"".I would also like to make note that during my first week in the position she reprimanded me for not disclosing at interview that I have mild eczema and interrogated me about any other health conditions I had that she was unaware of. This meeting was not documented.I spoke with the higher manager and managed to get the document changed to ""These anxiety issues were disclosed prior to starting this role in job and were stated to be under control, whilst I acknowledge that her anxiety is under control, Fwoggy7 can sometimes appear upset."" which I'm not 100% happy with but was the best compromise I could get. I've had a second meeting since with the higher manager regarding this mangers behaviour and have basically been told it's a he said she said situation and therefore she won't be taking it further. They haven't documented either of these meetings. I feel like I'm losing my mind though, this behaviour isn't acceptable right? And why does she want to make out on my record that I'm an anxious mess when I'm not? I've discussed it with other co-workers and they were surprised I even have an anxiety disorder, they couldn't tell! I've directly told management that it feels like they're building a case in order to transfer me and they've sworn up and down they aren't but I can't shake the feeling?Someone please set me straight here, am I'm being paranoid or are they being weird?",0

" HR hasn’t reply after issuing the offer… Don’t know whether this is related to the community.

I tried to send him a follow-up email but still didn't get any reply. So, I sent a thank-you email to the line manager that interviewed me, and I got a reply from him, saying congratulations and stuff. Does this mean I’ll 100% get the job? Or does HR have the right to rescind my offer because my right-to-work status didn’t fit?

" Employer asks for reasonable accommodations before hiring, potential for bias? Hi allI have been applying to some new roles recently and I noticed that some employers ask if you need reasonable accommodations when you inform them you have a disability (when you initially apply). Couldn't that be used as a undocumented bias against an employee that early on in the process? I'm not seeking accommodations myself but just curious. An employer can just look at that and be like ""why would I even bother dealing with this""- then toss your resume aside. I can see this being detrimental to our disabled veteran community.Is there a better way for veterans and other disabled folk to get the job and then inform them of accommodations?",0

" Feeling weird about my most recent contract to hire position/Interview So I started this new job on 09/17/22 and its a contract to hire position with a three month contract. During this time I feel as if Ive really excelled in the position and gained valuable insight in the industry. I was apart of a mass hiring for my specific department, I was brought in with 5 other people(4 of which were contractors, the other full time). 2 of the 4 contractors have already quit and I have about two weeks left on my contract. I applied through a recruiting agency while the full timer applied directly through the company website.I am a little peeved at the recruiting agency because I mentioned at the start how I did not want to be a contractor for this position. I had previous experience in this type of work but not the same industry. The recruiting agency told me that it was the only thing X company I work at was willing to do at the time. Then 2 weeks later they hire a full timer. I got lied to. I was also supposed to have 6 people on my interview call and just had 2. The full timer has let some details loose about his interview process and tells me he was given a skills assessment test which I was never given. The full timer also doesn't have much more experience than I do. 9 months at one job for bookkeeping/accounting. I have 9 months split between two different jobs.Im really struggling to understand why I was treated this way in the interview process, all things considered. Ive told upper management I would like to stay/ go full time and stop the bleeding of the cycle of contractors coming in and out. Im confused, angry, and starting to loose faith. Could anyone out there give me some advice?",0

" Director making Uncomfortable comments about my upcoming Maternity leave My site director has been making uncomfortable comments concerning my upcoming maternity leave.

"" I'm sure she will just answer calls when she's gone.""There have been more but they are basically all along these lines, and I unfortunately haven't been documenting the frequency of comments, or exact wording.I have given the feedback to my manager, who reports to our site director,  that these comments are making me uncomfortable and that I don't feel supported in trying to figure out a plan to either resolve my projects or come up with an alternative plan if I can't finish them due to mother nature's timeline. His response was to schedule a meeting to come up with a plan and to assure me that site director is only joking.My questions:  How should I respond next? Should I file a complaint with HR because it feels like my concerns are being side stepped and im still uncomfortable? Do I have a legitimate complaint to file with HR?",0
 is this grounds for unemployment?

"Concept of Marginal Investor in Cost of Equity from Damodaran's Lectures Hi guys, To understand cost of equity I ended up readingThis link : http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/littlebook/discountrates.htmfrom Damodaran's lectures. In this link he says that cost of equity that an equity investor demands from that stock. If there was only one equity investor, its easy to calculate that cost of equity. But with thousands of investors its tricky because every investor has a different risk aversion thus different cost of equity. So he introduces a notion of ""Marginal Investor"" who has majority stake and can actually influence the stock price. He says, to calculate cost of equity, we should consider risk from the point of view of this marginal investor assuming this marginal investor is well-diversified.I feel like I have barely understood this. Is it possible for someone to expand on this? Maybe also your take on cost of equity? ELI5 would be the best",2

" Work description & increased salary long due Long story short. Over a year ago I started doing manning planning at my current job, I was confused when I learned that the other two persons in my team have a higher responsibility rate. We have slightly different roles but we work as a team.Half a year after that the old worker who used to do my job comes back, after and before returning I learned that her responsibility rate had been higher than mine (same amount of responsibility & experience in the field).I was promised retroactive pay for the difference almost a year back now and I haven't seen anything and I've been nagging my boss about it. Now recently I got a new role and I was promised by the high boss of my department (above my boss) that I'd have a work description & increase in salary within the month of September.... Well nothing yet...The amount of work & responsibility has steadily been increasing yet no signs of higher salary. My morale is worse & I'm feeling old symptoms of stress & burnout coming back that I had gotten rid of roughly 2 years ago. I also feel very unmotivated.What do you think I should do? I've had loads of empty promises. I've loads done overtime, always offered my help & accepted new challenges. Done lots of development which has helped the company a whole lot. Yet very rarely do I receive even a ""Thank you"", and they cannot keep their promises...",0

"Pennsylvania, USA-- HIPPA violation? Dear Redditors. This is Pennsylvania, PA. I had been seeing a therapist for abuse and neglect from my father, …and lots of death in my family.

"My truck was illegally repoed from my apartment's parking garage by a loan company. I got it back in poor condition, wasn't given any documents, and they stopped returning calls... Help? I was told to come here for advice on what I should do going forward. For context, this happened in Texas, and I’m a college student.At the beginning of the fall semester, I was walking out to run a few errands. I walked into the parking garage and noticed my truck was not where I left it. I told myself I must have parked on another floor and checked every level until I reached the roof. I double-checked the entire garage, triple-checked it, and quadruple-checked it. I had already called my apartment's towing company, and they told me that they hadn’t picked it up.I believed it was stolen, so I called the police to file a report and prepared to make the police report for the insurance claim (Another nightmare). Eventually, the police found my truck was under a lien. The thing is that my truck was paid off, and the title was under my name.I called the “lien holder ”/ loan holder, and a manager said the truck was sent to auction. After a bit of back and forth, they finally relented with the information and evidence I provided. My truck was delivered to one of their loan branches from another city.I got to the branch, and they told me they had no idea the truck about this mess (I highly doubt it). The loan branch also did not have any documents regarding this. I was only given a key to my truck, so I went to inspect it. As I opened the driver's door, I noticed a foul stench, grease stains all over the truck cloth, a hanging dashboard, and the brakes were feeling off. I called back the manager I spoke to earlier, and they said I would receive documents regarding this ordeal, but they never did arrive and stopped answering my calls.This ordeal infuriated me because I missed classes for a week, got in trouble at my job because I had to call in, and was put under a heavy financial strain. I want to do something about this, but I don’t know where to start or who to contact. I’m also broke, so I don’t know if I could even consult a lawyer.

" Pay Transparency and Fraud?   I recently contacted HR to provide the salary ranges for two backfill positions I am posting (Greenhouse if it matters.)The ranges were VERY low  (by 10s of 1000s) compared to the previous hires. When I followed up with HR, they said that was the minimum and the mid point, and that the true max was higher.HR insists that I input the values they provided and sent to me via email. They won't input the ranges themselves, even though they also have to go into Greenhouse for other parts of the process.My concern is that somehow applicants may be mislead during the hiring process.  For example, when an applicant requests the range, which we must provide under WA law once an offer has been made, they would be told this lower range.Also, I believe WA law is changing soon to where we must provide the range upon making an offer, even if the applicant doesn't ask.

Could I have a case against a vet? I live in Virginia but drove 2 hrs round-trip sometimes 3 for traffic to an ophthalmologist who could see my yorkie for his cataracts. I was given a paper that said he'd be on antibiotics before surgery and other meds months before surgery. I postponed and notified the vet that he had cushings disease and was going thru testing so we postponed surgery until last June 2022. I paid 6400 for the surgery. She said he had no detached retina and was cleared for surgery so he had surgery and no antibiotics given before surgery. He got an eye infection and couldn't see after surgery. He was then given antibiotics after I drive back to have him seen in Maryland. Since then he has been on eye drops with barely any improvement. She then said in his last visit that he had a detached retina in one eye and some sight in the other. Probably due to his cusbings. Now why wasn't I informed of that before? He also had high BP she said was due to the cushings that causes the building behind his eye causing the detached retina. I feel now I should have just put him down but I love this now 13 yr old dog and if I'd know the cushings caused blindness then I wouldn't have gone ahead with surgery. What are any chances I have to take any legal action for possible negligence? It's Maryland and it says I'm not allowed to record anything without consent.,1

" Do I have any right to be upset at my manager/coworkers? struggling with RA So I work at a grocery store overnight and do stocking, was recently promoted to a key Carrier. About a year ago I started having severe foot pain to the point I couldn't walk and would limp around because I wouldn't want to call in and have them do more work. Well I have the hardest set (aisles) as they are canned items and juice which is rather heavy for myself especially this time of year. I was told when I first came to this store this set was temporary because I was taking over for someone who was on medical leave and as soon as he returned he would take it back and I would become a ""floater"". They apparently really liked the way I did it and decided to keep me on it. Okay cool, no worries. Well my foot pain got to where I could no longer handle it and my podiatrist suggested I take off some time (just a few days mind you), so I asked for a couple days but was refused. After a couple weeks my tendon (posterior tibial to be exact) ended up nearly tearing. So she took me out on disability no ifs ands or butt's for 6 weeks. Well all that time while that foot (left) was hurting I was putting my weight on my right foot. And developed plantar fasciitis in my right foot. So now both feet are screwed.  Anyway, I came back from disability and that night they ordered extremely heavy for me and ended up not helping. So that morning my feet were so swollen I couldn't fit in my shoes. I had to call in that next night and ended up in a soft cast. I asked the store manager for an easier set, something for me to settle into and work my way up again. Like they did for the coworker I was covering for to begin with. But he said no, he likes things how they are. So I kinda just sucked it up and didn't want to cause drama. Fast forward to now, I was again in severe pain but damn near everywhere and was finally just diagnosed with RA. Was put on leave for 3 months to begin taking medication to make sure it adjusts with me since the last medication had me in the ER. My first night back was last night, and again they ordered EXTREMELY heavy (they purposely ordered small while I was gone only to order big to have me refill it) with no helping me again and I managed to limp my way around. So now my knees, feet and shins are swollen. If I were to ask again for my set (aisles) to be changed, do I have any right? Or is that me not being able to perform my job? I'm kinda confused and just scared honestly. I've been with this company 10 years and just now dealing with this disease is new and learning how to work with it is terrifying for me. This job is kinda all I know at this point in my life unfortunately. My managers for whatever reason won't work with me, but maybe they don't have to and that's why. I'm not sure.But Thanks for any help and I'm really sorry for such a long post",0
"Mortgage, HELOC or Personal loan Hi all,I have 23k in credit card debt with a super high interest rate. I am trying to figure out a way to pay this off with a lower interest rate so that it is manageable. Here are my options:I am in the process of renegotiating my mortgage. If I add the 23k debt payment, they are going to increase my interest rate from 3.99% to 4.3%, which would increase my mortgage payment by almost $250 a month, so over the course of my mortgage at 30 yrs, that seems like a lot!Apply for a HELOC to pay it off. The interest rate is lowest with this option but I don’t know if a variable rate is a good idea and I don’t like the idea of basically taking out a second mortgage.Apply for a personal loan. The interest rate is like 11% though, but we would have it paid off in 10 years with a monthly payment of $316.Which option sounds best? Any advice would be much appreciated!Thank you :)",2
"What are drivers of the swap spread? I'm reading a book on fixed income and the chapter on swaps explains what the swap spread is, but doesn't really go into the drivers of the swap spread.  These are the things that I think matter to the swap spread (specifically I'm thinking about a 5 year LIBOR swap just to have a specific one to think about):Amount of hedging going on - swaps are usually used to hedge, so if there is a lot of buying of swaps, that should drive the swap price up.LIBOR is a rate that banks are using to lend to each other, so if there is elevated risk in the system, the swap spread should rise.Are these correct?  Are there other things that will affect that swap spread?",2
"Address Mgr Issues in Skip-Level?  I have a skip-level meeting with my HR Director (boss' boss) soon and don't know if I should bring up the issues I've had with my boss. I would appreciate any advice on how to bring this up or if I should keep it to myself for now.I am a mid-level HR Generalist and have been in HR 10 years. About 6 months ago I started a new job under a manager who has worked in HR almost 1 year now. Her background is in Recruiting.The issues are:Boss is adamant I start all one on ones with employees by reassuring them it is 100% confidential. This is 100% not true. On top of not enjoying lying to employees, I feel they lose confidence when they think I can't or won't escalate Ops issues in the interest of not breaking confidentiality. (I tried to explain my perspective but my boss just responded with ""So you're refusing to do it?"")Boss is adamant I do not take notes in one-on-one meetings with employees because she would feel weird as an employee if HR were to take notes. (EEs regularly thank me for documenting details of our meetings so I explained the thanks and kudos I've received to my boss. She just said it is too uncomfortable for me to take notes and to stop)Boss will give me explicit instructions (eg. don't send this in Teams; CC the Department) and will then call me out for not doing the opposite of what she said. It's so petty.Just infinite pettinessBoss will ask for a lot of detail immediately upon us BOTH learning of a situation and will rapid-fire questions at me even if she is aware I am finding information out at the exact same time as her (example below if you want detail).TLDR: I have a skip-level meeting with my director (boss' boss) soon and am hesitant to bring up any of the issues I've had with my boss. What direction does this sub think I should take?Example: Within seconds of seeing an employee had been out and asking my boss if she'd heard anything, she asked the below questions in rapid succession. When I didn't know the answers off the top of my head she asked me ""Well what do you know?"" which I found to be unbelievably rude. Also some of the questions she asked, there's no way I could know the answer without checking the HRIS.",0
" I’m being harassed and idk what to do   I work for a small recruiting agency. I was hired to be office manager/ recruiter without experience ( my leadership experience is from being a manufacturing supervisor 10 yrs). They knew this when they hired me for the position. I report to the sales manager and she’s training me on how to recruit. Long story short, she is upset that I disagree so much with her way of thinking or the way she handles situations. She is intense and doesn’t think before she speaks. She’s unorganized and just all over the place. I’m the total opposite. She tried to get me against other employees and it didn’t work. So now she is harassing me and literally told me she is trying to make me quit. She is constantly yelling at me telling me to shut up and stop talking. She yells at me in front of the temporary workers that come and apply.. it’s so unprofessional and embarrassing. She also changed my hours and my responsibilities. I tried to reach out to the owner and he was icing me out so I went to his main office. He said he was going to fix it and that she couldn’t fire me but now he’s been icing me out again. I’m not sure what to do. She told someone else in the office that she was going to make my life miserable so I can quit and she will make sure I don’t get unemployment. She’s also made it clear that she’s actively interviewing for my replacement. She’s been harassing me for the last 3 weeks and picking on me. Idk what else to do at this point. Please helpppppp.",0

" What kinds of background (OSINT) checks for social media/phone numbers do corporate/tech HR hiring departments conduct? I was hired earlier this year by a multinational corporate tech company without any reference or background check. This practice, I am certain, is not a common occurance. I was hired in an offshoot division of a large company they are calling their ""startup"" lab, hence the lack of background check process that would otherwise be conducted by their parent company.When the company was restructured with new HR policies, I was laid off, but wasn't told it was due to anything related to my social media. They told me it was due to the economy and the nature of restructuring at the organization.I'm not sure I entirely buy that, since I received some comments in September from a senior above me who made weird ""joking"" comments outside of work off the record about a certain scandalous social media platform that I once had before I had the job, but since deleted everything about two years before I was ever hired. It was as if she knew something and was poking fun at me. My real name was never associated with that account, only my phone number.I am starting to worry there may be unfavourable content related to my phone number and email address, although I have since deleted as much as I could.I am wondering what kinds of searches do corporate HR departments use when screening candidates?I am worried about the following:Deleted tweets from deleted twitter profiles?Deleted social media profiles associated with my phone numberDeleted social media profiles associated with my personal emailDeleted social media comments associated with my phone/emailAs well, would I be able to consult a professional who could run a background check on my social media/phone number?

"For a book, can self defense be premeditated? I'm writing a book and one of the storylines revolves around a group of children that escape an abusive home. One of them is older than the rest and subject to sexual abuse. They learn the code to the safe where the abuser keeps his gun, and at some point go and fetch the gun and shoot the abuser. And 15 years later end up confessing what happened. On the one hand I am aware that US law does allow for the use of deadly force to protect oneself and or others, however the firearm is not within grabbing distance nor does this happen during an altercation, it happens because the individual believes it to be the only way to be safe. It is however fairly calculated and premeditated. What are the legal charges? Would it have to go to trial to establish  motive and circumstances? What would the best case (even if very unlikely) outcome be for this individual? They're about 13 at the time of the killing. The evidence would be limited, however the individual has already signed a confession. The rest of the story is not about anything to do with crime or the justice system but I would like to make that part as ""plausible"" as possible at the very least rather than just making up jibberish. Any advice on this example or places I might be able to find a consult or ways to research this effectively would be very much appreciated.",1

Got the offer Tuesday and they said I had to complete the signature to proceed with background check by Wednesday or it could delay my first day which would be next week.There is one job on my resume that definitely will not show up on the credit report. I do however know the owner of that company and he will verify should they ask. They shipped me the equipment for the job today, two days after I completed the info for the background check. They also mentioned it would take about a month for the check to be complete.

This lunch invite was sent via outlook without any discussion prior or any specifics on why we are going out to lunch - just, “hey guys, want to grab lunch next Friday?”It could be that the three of us are the only members of our team in the area and he just wants to be social as he is a really social and nice guy, but it just seems odd and out of the blue to me.

"Father passed without a living will- girlfriend wants items in safe My father recently passed away without a living will. He has two children, me and my brother. He has put most of his assets in precious metals that are in a safe with his girlfriend (they own an apartment together, but the deed is to her). The girlfriend has access to the safe, and thinks this money is for ""her retirement"".My father has told over 8 people that his wishes are that the precious metals go to me and my brother, and that he trusts his girlfriend to open the safe and give it to us -_-.  Well, we went to collect the items from the safe, and she immediately lied about the location of the safe. She does not speak much English, so we also have language barrier, and sometimes need to call a family friend to translate.After we confronted her about the location of the safe, and that we were not going to leave without the contents of the safe because it is ours (my father purchased the majority of these items with my grandfather's inheritance who we are very close to, we were also NOT estranged from my father) she called the cops to remove us from the house. The cops sided with us and said that what is in the safe is rightfully ours as we are his children. When the situation did not go her way, she faked a medical emergency and had EMS come to the house and we all had to leave- she locked the door to the room with the safe and pretended to lost the keys when the cops asked her to bring us to the safe.ANYWAY, we are kind of at a lost of actions to do here without these metals going missing. We were able to get purchase receipts and records from my dad's emails with his name on his purchases and the accounts. Some of the metals have serial numbers but not all. We have the serial numbers to some but not all that have serial numbers. We have a rough estimate of a value of over 200k. He also has other belonging at this house- but nothing we are too concerned with like clothing and other nonsense. But we do need his laptops.We have delivered her a letter of demand listing the items we need to retrieve, and we have a lot of evidence texts and witness accounts that she confirmed the precious metals are in the safe (not the exact amount).  She has other done other illegal things prior to his death and after. My father was a vulnerable person, and she took advantage of that. We will be delivering a second letter asking for 3X the damages if she does not comply. Right now she is not communicating with us, by phone or answering the door.We cannot open probate yet because we do not have the death certificate. We will be hopefully getting that sometime this week, but time is dwindling as she has access to all of these precious metals. It is the weekend, but we will be filing a police report and reporting the items stolen. Now, we are still trying to get her to comply, but then of course the items could be missing from the safe.Looking for guidance on what else we could do.... We have spoken to an attorney but as I mentioned we cannot start until we have the death certificate.",1
" does my boss like me or it’s all in my head Okay so this all started happening when i got this new job a few months ago. my boss is an attractive man that easily are a lot of girls type. when i first started i was more to myself so I wouldn’t engage in any kind of flirting with anyone because I wanted to make a good impression first. I never thought anything of it at all but then I slowly started realizing my boss would always say hi to me when I walked into work and would stare me down mainly my eyes. mind you we work with 100+ employees( he doesn’t say hi to everyone like this). he’ll always just stare at me and smile, he’ll mess with me and joke around saying stupid work related stuff, he’ll come up to me and tell me I’m such a hard worker. He’ll also just touch my arm or shoulder really gently when I’m not looking to let me know he’s saying hi to me if he hasn’t had the chance to. I always wear my hair down at work literally every day since I started. I put my hair in a bun recently because I got really hot and I noticed he kept staring ( he’s also never gave me any compliments that are inappropriate, just very innocent compliments.) but then he finally tells me when we are next to each other that he’s loving the new look and smirks at me. he is very friendly to everyone there but in my gut I feel something different especially with the tension we have any time we speak to each other. He’s definitely not obsessive or always worried about me but just when he has time he’ll make it fun. He doesn’t really stare and gaze at me if we are working in different areas only sometimes but mostly when we walk past each other he’ll just make a little joke or stare in my eyes and smile. the main thing for me that I just want to know is if the touching means something because he does not do that with everybody at all. He’ll also wait for my reaction but it’s very very innocent the touch",0

We used to work in the same department, but that changed about a year ago.I have reported this coworker to HR twice- once for sexual harassment and once for retaliation after that report. Due to the nature of the incidents reported, and the fact that the comments were made only to me, he is aware that I am the person who reported him. Both times HR investigated, and I was told he admitted wrongdoing.Now, he is contacting me via internal messaging systems about non-work related matters once to twice per week. I do not respond or encourage him to message me in any way. However, the continued contact has made me very uncomfortable. Recently, he has started responding or messaging me on other systems asking why I am not responding to him.My question is- how can I tell him to leave me alone?

"Philosophical differences between manager and HRBP  I'm a manager in a call center environment.We have an occurrence/point attendance policy that follows a typical progressive corrective action process if violated (X number of points accrued is a first reminder, Y number of points is a second reminder and so on). We also have a policy around monthly performance expectations.I was working with my HRBP seeking to term an agent for a specific egregious offense, for which the company has termed in the past. I happened to mention that this agent also had a history of performance and attendance problems (and on corrective action for both) with my point basically being that this is not a great employee and the company is better off without them. My HRBP and I then had an intense conversation about bias and how that can't come into play when making these types of decisions, etc. We ended up terming the employee due to the egregious offense.But how is it bias if I, as a manager, am looking overall at this agent and have documentation and metrics showing me that they aren't producing for the company? What if we take out the ""egregious offense"" and just had an agent with multiple corrective actions, bad attitude and not a team player? I would not have my HRBP support in seeking to separate that employee from the company, with their explanation that it puts the company at risk.It just feels like my HR team would rather have operations hang on to poor performers and bad cultural fits just to avoid the chance that someone might sue or file for unemployment.I dont want to create risk for the company when making operational decisions, so I often heed my HRBP advice, even if I really struggle to agree with it. As a manager, I feel that sometimes a judgment call is necessary, whereas HR says you basically have to treat everyone the same no matter the circumstances.Am I really in the wrong for my way of thinking, or is my HRBP too rigid in their recommendations?",0

" Would attempts to document ""poor performance"" be undermined by inconsistent or non-existent KPIs and job duties? TL;DR my employer didn't assign me KPIs until after year-end and I feel I've been set up to ""fail"" my annual performance review. I am the only person out of 100+ staff with different metrics and wasn't given time to do my self-assessment. Am I being punished for needing to work hybrid for medical and financial reasons?I've been with my current company for over a year and am approaching my second annual performance review. Last year, I pointed out that the forms used to evaluate employees didn't apply to my role - I am the only person doing a very different job from the majority of our staff and almost none of the criteria was relevant or possible for me. I requested then that my employer set specific KPIs and goals for my position, and asked repeatedly over the next year, but the closest I got was a vague list of ""priorities"" for my department.It wasn't a huge deal for the first 6 months as I reported directly to upper management. My boss had final say on how I spent my time, assigned my projects, and filtered requests from other departments. Some structural changes caused my workload to increase exponentially and I was expected to manage my department's priorities myself, letting my boss know if I ran into issues balancing everything. I have been waving that white flag for months now.Thing is, everything on my plate at this point is considered a ""top priority"". When I warn that adding x deadline threatens y deadline, I'm reminded that both are critical. Every project I have is either ""vital for securing business"" or is vital to allowing someone else to, so no one wants to wait until I finish my current projects nor extend their deadlines. My KPIs were essentially ""meet every deadline, regardless of how many there are and whether or not you agreed it was possible.""My team narrowly missed only one external deadline in 12 months. My boss blamed this on me working hybrid and started looping HR into emails venting frustration, attaching documents with responsibilities of my role that I'd never even seen before. I ended up meeting with HR several times about this and requested a formal accommodation (medically valid) to help me try to meet expectations, but they were puzzled by it all. I couldn't meet expectations without more overtime, but couldn't work more with my commute and health issues - HR felt it was workload, not my health or commute that was the issue, but the meetings alone were delaying projects so things were basically left at ""let's sort this out once everyone has less on their plate""... that was a few months ago.With less than 24 hours until my review, I was emailed a new form to replace the other irrelevant one. Everyone else has had weeks to fill in their form, but my employer won't reschedule mine to give me time to do it while also assigning more projects. The KPIs on the form weren't shared with me prior to this, mostly aren't measurable, and don't align with what I was told last year.I don't think it's based on discriminatory factors (though I am an obvious minority there in a few ways) but I do feel singled out from 100+ employees with the way this is being handled. I know my boss isn't happy that I'm pushing to stay hybrid, but spending 15+ hours a week commuting isn't an option and the open office is harder for me to work in anyways. I was treated great until everyone was asked to return to the office full-time to ""strengthen company culture"". I was told when interviewing that I could work remotely after training if I needed to.I'm not sure if it's sheer ignorance, limiting my ability to secure a raise, or an attempt to document performance issues in case they let me go, but it really bothers me. I've never been written up and actually like my boss, company, and job - I'm just drowning workload wise while I can't even pay my bills.Is this worth taking back to HR?

" is my manager trying to transfer me to a different team without telling me ?  5 weeks into new job. During last one on 1 with manager, he asked me questions like "" do you feel like people are being able to answer ur questions timely..if not please don't hesitate to reach out and ask anyone "" and ""do you need anything, like a better desk or anything to help you with your work""He then told me he had some assignments for me, but had to reset his password before i could start. Told me he would ping me when he reset it . He did ping me about something related to the assinment (told me to cc xyz person whe. I was done with assignment ) but he did not tell me he reset password.I didn't realize he had reset it until I checked the Google doc myself right before the end of my shift.obviously it was too late for me to start on my assignment by then.Looked for the assignment first thing in the morning the following day. Couldn't find it. Went into his office. He told me they were with him(he took them from my.desk lol) and gave them to someone else. He basically took them away and reassigned to another coworker.2 days later, team lead from our department  emailed me saying they wanted to check in and see how training was  going and to discuss""next steps"" . Team lead says he'll meet with me after he ""received more information about MY ACTUAL TEAM PLACEMENT ""But to be fair, he asked a few weeks earlier whether I heard from team lead and told me that I would be doing what I'm doing currently for  a few more weeks before moving onto something elseIn our very first meeting 5 wks ago, he told me he moved someone because he felt like she wasn't catching onto things after bring explained things multiple times and that he just ""got a feeling "" it wouldn't work outdoes this mean I'm being moved to a different team?does this mean my boss doesn't like want me on his team anymore ?",0
" can I ask for a bonus? I am working for a smaller business where I am currently filling in for the office manager while she is on maternity leave. We are in West Virginia  and the business is an office based medication assisted treatment for opiate addiction. She has been out since the beginning of October, but even before that she was working a lot less and I had taken on a lot more responsibility. What I am asking is if it seems selfish of me to think I would receive compensation for that time. If I were to receive some, when would I receive it? Can I ask for it while the manager is still out on maternity leave? It is up in the air on when she will be back (possibly mid December/possibly after the new year) and it is also unknown if she will be part time when she comes back. I believe I will be keeping some of my new responsibilities even after she comes back. I've also been told by the providers that I've been doing a better job than the office manager and they appreciate me. I guess I need some guidance on this as I also don't want to be selfish.",0
"Dealership mechanics installed driveshaft prior to road trip (CA to AK). Broke down 1k miles later and now am stuck in OR. Not sure if it was a part failure or improperly installed. Trip is now falling apart through no fault of my own. Thats life or do I need a lawyer? Details: I am a Florida resident that lived in California for three months. I had my vehicle serviced in CA before heading out on a road trip to Alaska. The service included a warranty/recall repair for my driveshaft. I drove it around that town for two weeks after repair then began my trip to AK. After approximately 1000 miles the u-joint at the driveshaft connection failed. The dealership I towed it to said they are unsure if it was part failure or improper installation.What I am concerned about is that both manufacturer and shop that installed part are going to deny responsibility and I am stuck with two to three weeks hotel and car rental costs in addition to possibly missing out on entire trip to Alaska (reservations are all full for later dates so already going to miss out on half of what was planned)Should I seek a lawyer at this stage or only if there is an issue? If so, why? And how does that work? Find one in FL, or in OR, CA?",1

" Should I tell my VP that I'm not getting support from my Director? Hey guys, I'm torn and would appreciate your perspective. I just started at a new company 5 weeks ago as one of their account managers. This company is new-ish and likes to tout that they are a small start-up but that's bull at this point. They've been around for about a decade now. Within the past year or two, this company has grown from less than hundred to almost 300 now.Anyways, my director has been absent from the start, but to say that she's completely absent is also false. Week 1 (onboarding) was in-person at the office. She flew into town for a few days, during which she made no effort to set-up 1:1 time to meet/get to know me. I was surprised so I texted her to meet in-person to go over the ""lay of the land"" of my role and responsibilities before she flew out. Of course she responded delightfully and we met. However, when we met, she derailed. She had me shadow a client call then spent the rest of our meeting talking trash about the client. With 10 minutes left of our scheduled meeting, I tried to boil down topics to, ""what should I expect"", then got the answer of, ""don't worry, it'll come. I'll get on your calendar next week to go over everything."" This conversation occurred Thursday morning.So by midday Friday, nothing is on my calendar. I message her, she gets 15 minutes on my calendar as  a ""quick catch up"" on Monday.Monday rolls by, she's MIA. Completely misses our meeting. I texted her asking if we had rescheduled or if our ""quick catch up"" had been canceled. She apologized and said she was at her kids Halloween event, totally forgot, and will call me asap. She calls me from her car, as she's driving. I'm like, okay... we don't have to talk right now. You're clearly busy.... DRIVING. She insisted that she was fine and stated she didn't have time later. She said she'd get some more training on my calendar but nothing came.In the days coming, she was consistently late or had to leave meetings early. She would either (1) ignore my Slack messages, (2) respond HOURS/DAYS later, (3) provide a response that didn't answer the question, or (4) respond but no follow through with action items.To this day, we still have not level-set on goals. There is lack of clear expectations. When I do ask, I don't get a timely response (lucky if I even get a response).Here's the BS part. She doesn't response to my personal Slack messages, but in group Slack messages, she's have a ball over there with responses and emojis.Everyone else at the company is great. My director sucks. She keeps saying how busy she is. I'm made to feel like a burden. I just started. I have been leaning on others for help, guidance and support.Coincidentally, my VP just recently got on my calendar for a ""catch up"" session later this week.Should I tell her? What should I do?",0

Background check delay Indiana  I accepted a position with a company for $105k in the finance dept. I submitted all my info to Accurate (the company they are using) for the background check and it is taking 3 weeks!  First they found someone with my name in GA with a criminal record and I proved it isn’t me.  Now they are waiting for the state I live in (Indiana)to return the criminal data. Is this company doing something other companies haven’t?  I have made this much before with no issues and have passed all background checks and this is holding up my start date and pushed out my benefits until the first of the year so it has become a big problem. Is there any way to make this go faster?  I have completed 3 background checks in the last 2 years with zero issue. What is the deal??,0
"Delayed Raises/Bonuses. I live and work in Kentucky, USA. I work for a large boc shipping company, I can elaborate more if necessary. There is a union, and I am a supervisor, which means I am not in the union.The union members have gotten about a four dollar raise. We were told we would also be getting raises, but there are issues with the union raises, delays and giving the wrong amount of money. We were told this has to be fixed before our raises were to take place, as in bottom to the too. We were told this in person by our supervisor, about 3 weeks ago, and the raises for union members have been in the works for around a month before that.I have not been able to find out when our raises are supposed to take place. I have also not been able to find out if there will be retroactive, like the union raises. To the best of my knowledge, union members  got raises, but were told they would see the change in one lump sum, then at the higher pay from then on. Talking to other supervisors, supervisor raises have not been retroactive in the past.Also, we are overdue for I believe  two bonuses. It's based on our facility's quarterly performance. I have worked as as supe for 8 months, and have gotten two bonuses, so I believe I am overdue one.Is there anything here that is at least interesting enough to try to get more information to pursue legally?

" I dont know how to ask this question  . So ive been with my current company for about 2.5 years (started first week march 2020). In september 2021 i was given a review that basically said i was failing to meet the standards set by my boss. I was devistated, but attempted to turn things around for the better. I tried to work harfer and smarter. Then, back in April, i was approached to do training for a promotion to a new position (think level 1 software engineer going to level 2) but needed to complete the training. The training is 6 months and has nothing to do with my current job. Anyways, im currently in the training  I had a meeting with my boss and asked about what will come after the training. He said an evaluation period. He also said, while improvement was made on my end, he still wasnt happy with my progress before the training. He said, and i quote, ""my work didnt bring value to the company"" and the training was ""a generouse offer by the company"" to me. That really rubbed me the wrong way. Part of me wants to find another job but im afraid to look for new opportunities because i fear they will contact my current employer and they will give a negative neview about me. Then not only willni be out a new job but ill have the stink of  my boss knowing i tried to leave on me. I dont know what to do and the whole situation has made me very depressed.

"Question Why is it not possible to have ""floating point or constant ratio"" leverage wherein if say one invests 10 dollars and borrows 90 dollars, if the stock price rises to 100 then the person will have 1,000 dollars worth of stock. But that person will now still only have 90 dollars borrowed whereas if they had a constant ratio of leverage the entire time, with automatically increasing loans to keep the 1:9 ratio constant, the person would have more like 90,000 dollars when the original stock price reached 100Let's say the price first reaches 20, then it can be sold for 200, 90 paid back, left with 110, then 990 is borrowed, position is now 1,100 instead of the original 200. Stock goes up to 40, 2,200 is sold, 990 paid back, left with 1,300, 11,170 is  borrowed, 14,470 is new position, stock goes up to 80, 28,960 is sold, 11,170 paid back 17,790 is left. 160,110 is borrowed. 177,900 is new position. Goes up to 100, 222,375, 160,110 is paid back, left with 62,265. The profit would get larger the smaller the sell-borrow-buy increments become, I think if you could keep the ratio as constant as possible you would get up to ~ 90,000 at the end but don't currently know all the mathematics.Is this an existing financial instrument? It would also work the other way around wherein a person's loans are automatically reduced if the stock price drops to keep the leverage ratio constant and prevent early bankruptcy (the usual pitfall of leveraging).The exact mathematics of this field are something obviously possible and I may work them out in the future.",2

"I provided a doctor’s note to WFH for two weeks. My employer does not believe that they have to follow it and still want me to come into the office. Missouri. Local government. I’ve actually posted before about my hostile work environment, and I’ve been recording everything that happens and gathering evidence. So this is what happened today.I sprained my ankle on Thursday. Initially, the doctor at urgent care told me it was broken and recorded it as such on the paperwork she gave me, but gave me no further paperwork regarding work except to go back on Monday. That didn’t really make much sense to me, but she told me that they don’t really handle those notes unless it’s workers comp related, and to bring it up with the orthopedist she referred me to as to whether or not I should go to the office, WFH, whichever. Well, weird, but whatever. I worked on Monday, it was absolute hell. The urgent care doctor had put me on crutches, and holy hell, are they hard. Going to the bathroom took me twenty minutes in our old, outdated building, and walking to and from my car was such a hassle that one of my coworkers actually grabbed a wheelchair for me.The earliest I got into the orthopedist was today. She said that my ankle wasn’t actually broken, but was sprained. Again, weird, but whatever. She gave me a note saying to WFH for two weeks, until my follow-up appointment, due to the need to not put too much weight on my foot or walk around too much, and use one crutch (instead of both) when I walked. They faxed a letter over to my office, and I called to ensure that they received it.My boss answered, I told her the situation, and she immediately started trying to get me to say that I had specifically requested the doctor to give me this note. I almost felt like I was being recorded. She kept repeating, “So you asked the doctor to give you that note, though?” in an accusatory tone. I told her I did not, because I did not.I knew that she would tell the higher-ups that I said that, or she’d tell them that I didn’t, but that she “knew I was lying”, just like before, so all I could do was just tell the truth and say that this is what the doctor told me to do since it was an option (better than not working at all, which was the only other one).She said that she didn’t think they accepted doctors notes for sprains. She said that “all the other people here” (which is nobody) over the years always came in and worked in the office with sprains. I told her blankly that I didn’t know what to tell her, because, well, I didn’t. She said she’d talk it over with our higher-ups, but didn’t think they’d do it.This job has just been absolute hell. I have never dealt with such a petty, childish, and vindictive group of people before in my life. At this point, I’ve had one job interview and got asked to do another, but I don’t want to get my hopes up for either one, for obvious reasons. But I’m wondering if I should just quit and sue. It’s gone on for too long already.",1
"How do Car Title Transfers work I had a question on getting a car title transferred from my gfs dad to her. As some preface there are a lot of stupid decisions that were made before I got involved and I realize they were dumb. I'm just trying to look for the best way forward and to get more information because I know nothing about how any of this would work.My gf and her dad bought a car and took out a small loan to do so. The loan and title are in the dad's name. He explained to her that he would take out the loan for her because she wouldn't be able to. Instead, she would give him money and he would make the payments. This I know makes the car his by any legal definition.Now here comes the part I need help understanding. The loan is almost paid off and will be in about 3/4 months. Recently her dad has declared bankruptcy. What I don't know is that when the car is paid off, will he even be able to transfer the title to her or will that be listed as an asset for his bankruptcy and have to be liquidated?",2

"I’m being targeted by workplace bullies. I finally said something to management today and I feel stupid  I’m a 30 y/o woman living in   and in my 11 years of working I have never had a group of people dislike me so deeply. My managers and upper managers like me. I am on of the top sales performers as well.I’ll try to make this long story short.Last Sunday after I finished with a client a member of my team who we will call Sabrina started going around to all of my other teammates whispering something to them. I started to feel uncomfortable because I really felt like she was gossiping about me and I am not a confrontational person. I called my manager and let him know I wasn’t feeling well so I left.Yesterday I worked with Sabrina, she didn’t speak to me but I was busy with appointments throughout my day anyway so I didn’t interact with many coworkers.Today I come into work and Sabrina was standing in a circle what looked to me like gossiping. Someone walked into the store I work at and I know him personally from outside of work so I said hi to him. Sabrina went up to him and asked if he needed help. Shortly after i asked him how he has been and how long he would be in town for. I let him know he has my number if he needs anything.I walked away and Sabrina said didn’t you just see me greet him? I said yeah I know but I personally know him. Another coworker who seemed to have been gossiping said “you say that every time it’s disgusting.” The other two coworkers she was standing around refuse to talk to me ever since Sunday. Nobody ever told me what I did wrong. I’m assuming I sold a lot and left early so they were annoyed by that. However I did leave because the gossiping was making me so anxious I couldn’t work.Sabrina kept throwing jabs at me throughout the day. At the end of the day I had a client come in, he had an exchange. He was in the fitting room trying it on and came out to show his friends and ask for their opinion. Sabrina was standing next to me the whole time because she was helping the friends. I don’t believe she realized that this client was doing an exchange that I had originally sold him. So when I told him it looks nice and he should get that one she muttered “you’re going to learn today”.I walked away and called my supervisor and let him know of everything that was going on. He had witnessed her complaining about me earlier. I told him what has been happening with the team and how she’s behaving. I have never gone to management over a coworker.TLDR; Sabrina used to be a work friend, we’re both the same age and attractive women. I relate more to the customers I think and clients do seem to gravitate toward me. Where she kind of walks around, stares in the mirrors and talks to associates all day.Two weeks ago she screamed at me for trying to “take her customer” (he wasn’t being helped and was walking around trying to find anyone to assist him) she pointed her finger in my face and wouldn’t stop yelling. I had to tell her to leave me alone 3 times.",0
" not getting sick pay after everyone else did Long story short this is starting because I got covid from work (last Thursday, 11/10) and went back today (11/21) and after asking if I needed to test negative before returning and being told no, I was sent home for sounding sick.I was also told that the owner of the company had tested positive for 10 days and still been at the office without a mask and that I wasn’t the only person out (4 other people were).I also asked if we’d be getting covid sick pay (because everyone else up to that point had been given sick pay) and was told no. There is a lot of other things about this job that I’d like to ask about but the main question is, if there was no company policy about covid or covid pay sent out and everything had been by ear for others and I’m the only person not getting sick pay, what do I do?

"Leasing office claiming rent not paid..while it was cashed in their posession. I would like some clarity on a situation my   sister just informed me is she is experiencing with the leasing office  of her apartment complex in georgia.On may 4th she placed a money order for her rent in the deposit box. She then texted them so they can confirm receipt of the money order, they confirmed receipt of it on March 4th at 2pm. On march 8th she received a late payment notice stating that they have not received payment from her, she texted them inquiring about it  and they said that they received it but they havent integrated it into the system, but they assured her that they have on file that they received it on time so just disregard the email.

She then dropped off a next money order on april 2nd and they confirmed receipt on april 2nd.  She receives an email from the leasing office on april 12th stating that the money order from march was  not able to be cashed. The leasing office told her in an email  that when they spoke to western union, western union tracked it and said that it was cashed on the 8th of march(they confirmed receipt on 4th of march) but the leasing office would have to open an inquiry and pay to see who cashed the money order.they have opened the inquiry and are waiting to hear what western union says.they told her that there were no issues with the April payment as it had been deposited already.

A week later she gets another email saying that there was an issue with the April payment as well and she now owes them nearly 2k in rent and she would have to have it paid off or she will probably face eviction.

She has all her receipts for her money orders and also their confirmation receiving the money order in writing. I'm assuming the leasing office would have to open a case on the april money order as well....so I'll wait to hear what they say on that  .I told her to have all her documentation and she'll need to either speak to the police or a lawyer.

Can they evict her for a money order that was cashed while it was in their posession?

Sidenote: she's been paying them consistently with this method for the last 2 years with no issues but there are now new staff in the office and this is now happening.",1

" Underwhelmed with my 3.3% raise. Has anyone ever successfully gone back to their boss and gotten a better raise? Been at the company which is smaller and doing quite well for a year. On my anniversary I got an email from my boss thanking me for my service and outlining my 3.3% (basically, inflation) raise.I’ve worked my butt off this year learning and adapting at the extremely specialized nature of the product this company manufactures. The company has a very small, interwoven team that I’ve meshed well with. I’ve had nothing but positive comments from management and co-workers, so to say I’m disappointed with this barely a raise is an understatement. The company has no formal review process, no goal setting, and very little actual training.  I fee so disheartened after all the work and effort I’ve put in over the last year wasn’t rewarded financially.HR peeps, any stories of people going back to management about their raise, and how that went? Suggestions on how to handle? Do I just say ok, thanks, and start looking for something new?I know you’re all going to tell me it’s time to leave this job, and sadly, that’s probably the road I’ll have to take. I won’t be able to leave until after the 1st of the year so I can receive my annual bonus, profit sharing, and 401(k) match.",0
" Ambulance service unpaid on call This will be kind of long but I’m giving as much context as possible. I work for a county government run ambulance service in December ‘21 they instituted a policy for “ emergency selective call back”. This was an on the books policy for disasters and special teams but a provision was added, they could call us at anytime day or night and we would have to respond to fill a vacancy on an ambulance. We work 24 hour shifts on what is called a Berkeley shift. We have a long standing on call policy that has expanded from 5 on call days to 17 with a mix of 0800-2000 and 2000-0800. We schedule our on call days and are paid 1 regular hour per 12 hour on call block. 

 We are contacted several times a week and this policy has been utilized over 250 times since January. So it doesn’t seem like an emergency utilization so much as a staffing tool/ on call. When the policy was first announced some mid level managers started saying that there would be punishment if you didn’t come in. I contacted the deputy chief of the department and they stated “ there is no requirement that you respond to the vacancy and only that you answer your phone or respond to a text about your availability. If someone is saying otherwise they are mischaracterizing the policy.” 

 In July the policy was again changed to now after three time of us saying we’re unavailable our Battalion chief ( mid level manager) will have a coaching session and the corrective action pathway will start per county policy. They also said we have to give a reason that we are unavailable, which the management staff will decide if that’s a valid reason. I pointed out to HR that the way the policy is read and was being utilized that it is an on call policy and if the department has an expectation that I be available to come in, they would need to pay the entire department and including back pay it would be about $2 million per year. They responded by changing the policy to state “ this is not an on call day and you will not be paid as such.” 

 I had a conversation with HR and expressed concerns about the ambulance service expecting to accept the benefit of my time than I should have been compensated. So they are taking it back to the committeeMy ultimate question is how can an organization have an expectation of my off duty time when I am not being paid?

"Long one: I’m in my early 20s and recently got into a physical fight with my dad (he attacked first). Long story short I ended up at my grandparents then stupidly decided to walk back to my RV…. …my RV (on parents property) with a few cuts on my arm (I inflicted two of them mainly from anger) that came about mainly from the fight.So, a cop pulls up alongside me and inquires about the cuts. I tell him the truth (worst decision if you only cut for the aesthetic) he then calls an ambulance (cool cop though), I then get stuck in a psychiatric ward for 9 damn days. I didn’t try to commit suicide I was just angry at the thought of regressing.PARENTS: My parents are an odd bunch, they like control and seem more akin to NPCs than humans (bad reasoning). The psychiatrist at the ward was almost corrupt, I could only really leave if I agreed to go to a rehab facility (no drug addiction, only occasional alcohol use). Well 15 days is the max but once I said I would go he let me out and said that’s what he was waiting for.How is that legal? They made bank off my Medicaid too. Long story short again, my parents pick me up and they expect me to go to rehab. I vehemently object then they kick me out of the car, I walk back to my grandparents (8 miles).Now during all of his I had social service people come to me about the abuse I’ve endured from my dad. He kicked me out 14 times from 15-17 years old. And he attacked me first during that fight for no reason other than impulsivity. I can apparently press chargers on him (I called social services today but they didn’t have a case on me).I have iPod (coordinates)proof of being kicked out 7 of the 14 times, and audio of a convo in which he admits it. They tried getting a court order to force me to go to rehab (30 days) but apparently couldn’t because of the abusive chargers on my dad (that’s why I know I could press chargers on him, my mother was pissed).So now the only way I can escape my grandparents 18th century home to go back to the RV(all of my stuff is there) and finally finish school is to go to a counseling/rehab place. They have given me lots of papers to sign but I’m too paranoid about it being some trap.They forced me to sign papers for another rehab place when I was 16 for guess what? Liking chemistry but they thought I was making meth or bombs lol. My parents won’t give me my stuff nor money, I’m just scared if I press chargers I’ll be left homeless or even worse they start press charges on me for “illegal “ items like a old weed pipe. They might just make up stuff.What are my best options? I am sorry for the disorganized writing I’m on mobile (I don’t have my computers, no WiFi either).Oh and my dad called the cops when I was pinning him down, they came and just broke it up. I never told them he hit first but somehow it’s on the report, and their the ones who took me to my grandparents (parents took car).",1

" asked to check with potential future direct reports before an internal job interview I have been with a company a little under a year and an opening that would be a promotion on our team team - in fact - 2 jobs opened up. When I asked to apply I was told to check with specifically one of the many direct reports by the hiring manager before I could apply. When we talked, he said he was interested as well and as there were two positions I encouraged he apply as well and told the hiring manager he had an interest and it sounded like we’d support each other if one or both of us got the job(s).He approached the hiring manager - said it was awkward - and didn’t apply. I still interviewed and then no one talked to me about it for weeks and told they had a ton of other candidates so I assumed I was interviewed as a courtesy and forgot about it. 3 weeks after the initial interview got notice I was going to be moved on and would interviewed by some potential direct reports including the colleague they made me “check with” - then I was told to say nothing until they were spoken to about my candidacy ahead of my interview - which was also really awkward.I said nothing, but the colleague I mentioned earlier confronted me because he saw the interview on our manager’s calendar. Then I sort of walked stuff back since they’d not had a chance to talk and I didn’t want detail to slip before the manager had spoken to them. He and I ended that conversation with him being supportive. He then confronted the manager and said he was not comfortable with me managing him and never gave me a real Blessing to interview unless he was promoted to one of the positions with me and the hiring manager was apparently very upset and seemed upset with me for bitching this whole thing by confirming my interview and trying to walk it back. I now have a 1:1 with the hiring manager at 9am Monday so my weekend is shot - can I lose my job over this? I assume I’m getting pulled from the running, but part of me feels this is on management for putting me in the position to seek permission from a possible direct report to interview in the first place. Also, HR has not been involved at all. Just this hiring manager and me so I don’t know if this is like even official. I’m dreading Monday.Can I be fired for this? Can I lose out on the opportunity?",0

" Leaving job, need to switch my family to my wife's insurance, company won't give me a loss of coverage letter. I'm leaving my job to run my business full time, my family will be moving to the health insurance offered by my wife's job but since we're outside of enrollment we would need to prove we're having a qualifying event.

HR at my job sent me a generic leaving packet via email that doesn't have my name on it anywhere, and on insurance they sent me a PDF that outlines how much COBRA would cost and says ""current coverage ends by the end of the month following your termination"".

I emailed HR, explained my situation and asked for a loss of coverage letter and they kept pointing back to the generic PDF.

I pressed further and they said they would ""check to see if this is something we have"" and then subsequently responded that they ""don't have this form"".

"Curious as to what my rights would, or would not have been in a past near domestic abuse case- long, my sincere apologies. So several months ago,  I was in a very ugly situation where I was living with my sibling and my in law, his wife, who has several psychiatric diagnosees. Said in law's mental illness is such that she routinely gets explosive fits of rage, and often takes it out (verbally) on other members of the family. I was spared of these attacks, at least in the beginning, but as time went on she began getting increasingly aggressive towards me as well, to the point that one day, she came  very well near actually attacking me. There wasn't physical assault,  but I felt physically threatened for reasons I'll go into more detail over, as she has been screaming very loudly over a very irrational and in actuality minor thing that could have easily been resolved in a calm rational conversation,  but she instead exploded vastly out of proportion to the situation, screaming for several minutes straight, (unprovoked mind you- I hadn't said anything to her prior to this to have set this off; it was in reaction to something minor and trivial that I hadn't even been aware she was mad about that happened days before.) After enduring several minutes of her raging at me, I simply couldn't stand to bear any more of this undue harrassment, and simply told her in a raised voice to stop yelling at me.So, this is the part of the story where I'd like advice as to helping to determine whether what she did from here would have been deemed, from a legal perspective,  outside of her legal rights to do to someone, and whether I could, or should, have possibly pressed charges, or would have had the right to exercise self defense, as I had felt very threatened by what ensued. So after saying this, her aggression sharply increased, where she immediately retaliated by screaming an equally loud and irrational reaction,  this time claiming how ""no one gets to talk to her that way,"" and then began to proceed to walk down the hallway towards me very quickly with this aggressive, angry look on her face and threatening body language.  I wasn't sure what she was going to attempt to do, if anything, but she was clearly beyond rationality at this point, and so I decided that the safest thing to try to do to try to de escalate this, knowing full well the extent of how volatile she gets when angry, would be to go into the nearest bedroom, and close and lock the door and wait until she calmed down, as I honestly judging by her reaction, felt that there was a chance she might try to engage in physical violence.So,  this is the part where I have to wonder, aside from that last bit alone, if what she did could have been construed or classified as legitimate harassment of some kind, and whether I would have had the right to have taken some sort of  action against her had I been able to do so in the moment.So mere moments after I had closed the door and locked it, rather than perhaps shouting through the door to get a last round of digs in before eventually giving up to go fume somewhere silently in a corner at her defeat as one might expect of your more garden variety person with anger problems and abusive tendencies, she instead decided to go full boar ballistic- and began screaming that she was going TO GET THE KEY!!! to unlock the door, with a noteable tinge of manic anger mixed with glee, just so she could presumably continue with this entirely unecessary, over the top, and insane onslaught of unprovoked aggressive behavior.(I sincerely apologize for the length thus far, but to try to sum the rest up:) So she did in fact fulfilling her demented promise by going so far as to actually violate an inherit boundary I had tried to erect in an effort to de escalate the situation by unlocking the door.  She bursted in several moments after making the threat to come in., but there had been enough time between when she screamed about that and when she actually came fumbling around with the key to try to unlock it that I thought I had actually perhaps had a milisecond to take a quick whizz on the toilet of the bathroom that happened to be attached to the bedroom I was in, as I had had to go pretty badly prior to all of this fiasco as it was. I knew I was taking a risk, but I miscalculated how ridiculously fast she woukd be in procuring said key, so before I had eveb enough time to pull up my pants and finish the deed in privacy,  she came barrelling into the room, helping herself right on in, staring me down, with absolutely little to no regard to or concern for the fact that not only had she already been violating boundaries by busting into a bedroom I'd locked to try to disengage from her lunacy, but now my personal space and privacy as well.  So yes, having her fling the door wide open to reveal me sitting on the pot was not only humiliating for me personally, but it at the very least should, at least with regards to any other human being, have presumably been surprising and shocking enough to have stopped her. A NORMAL person, (not to say a normal person would do half of what she did,) but upon seeing someone going to the bathroom, most peopel instinctively panic, and leave immediately out of shock and emmarrassment... knowing that it's just common human decency to give people their space. But no, not with this woman. Instead, the moment she saw this, she continued to just stand there, openly gaping and glaring at me in fact, almost mockingly, seething with an intense anger and hatred, and proceeded to continue the onslaught of verbal harassment while I'm still sitting there, really just wishing she would have the tiniest shred of decency and remorse come up inside  of her, and LEAVE. Feeling more than humiliated and violated at this point, I finally got up, (pulled up my jeans witb her still just standing there watching and slinging virtriolic language) and walked over to confront her, where I made it abundantly clear that I wanted her to get the blank out of the room. As soon as I did so, she blew it off by completely disregarding my request, and continued to just stand there and spew hateful remarks at me, in some attempt to continue to play what had clearly morphed into some demented, sadistic power trip.So, sparing you further details, as this has been long enough as it is, I just want to know if what I've told you thus far would be cause for someone to again have had the legal right to retaliate for the sake of self defense in some fashion against her at that point, to the point where she ended up taking things. For instance, if I had somehow been conveniently carrying pepper spray , would it have been fair for me to have used it on her in this instance, since she had effectively chased after me, and refused to back off, even after asking her to do so, (even though she never officially physically attacked...) could the level of aggression and the harrassment she was clearly demonstrating be considered a justifiable instance of a time where someone could have rightfully employed self defense, whether through this or other means, short of obviously gross physical assault i.e. beating them up?  Should I have simply called the police? If so, at which point in the progression of this chain of events would it have been justifiable and not considered an overreaction- after she broke in, after she came into the bathroom and refused to leave, effectively cornering me... or would either of these instances have been taken seriously enough to have her theoretically apprhended? I'm not likely  going to attempt to do anything after the fact, as obviously there is no actual evidence tgis even  occured and would merely be a ""he said she said"" and I really don't want to have to get involved in the legal process if it's not necessary, but I'm wondering once again from a legal professional's perspective, what I might do.  I am aware of the fact that I can, and have since, written down and documented the event in the small chance that I hear of anythign like this ever happeneing again to present as further evidence, but I'm wondering if there's anythign else that should be done, short of goign to police.  I've heard of mental health wlfare checks and so on, (as well as welfare checks for the otehr members of the household who happen to be living with an abusive person) but I again don't knwo if I should take it there, or if there's any intermediary less intense but still effective thing I could do that was pershaps a bit more anonymous and subtle? Like some mental health agency that works in tandem with law enforcement who could put a record of it on file or something?  Again, I really don't wish to have to go there, but thr thing is that she's also done things like this and worse to her daughter that I saw while living there, and have felt really conflicted about wgetger to report it or not because while she never beat her,, she did scream maliciously at the top of her lungs like she did at me qnd slap her.  Anyhow, I'm  truly sorry this was so long but thank you to anyone whose been patient enough to actually read this and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1

"Nothing being done about reported animal neglect Dallas County Iowa USA, I just moved here 2 months ago.The neighbors neglect their 3 horses. They are tied to trees in their yard by a 15 or so foot rope. They seem to be rotated to different trees every other week to eat the grass. The yard is maybe 1 acre. None of the grass within reach of the horses grows back taller than a short mow. I have never seen them supplemented with hay or grain. I have never seen them with access to any water. They are left tied to their trees in the sun, thunder and lighting, hail, rain, and snow.  They are thin and not wearing horse shoes, so their hooves are long and cracked. The youngest child there is very chatty and has given additional details. Apparently they want to breed one of them, one of them is considered ""stupid"" so she is rotated to fresh grass less often, and he likes to feed the horses his leftover top Ramen noodles. They had another horse who was put down because its leg was tangled in wires that were for some reason in the small stall they have. The horses are also tied to the far side of the house on occasion but ""get in trouble"" because they eat the piles of household garbage stored there.I suspect the people living there might be friends with the one sherif/cop who has anything to do with our town. I suspect this because other reports have been made, nothing has been done of the course of the past few years. From what I can tell, the cop goes over, chit chats, and leaves. How do I force action? I made an anonymous report today. I feel like such a bad person for this, but they are just neglectful people. The state of the children's wellbeing is questionable, but I have no proof of abuse. I'm nervous to report them because I don't want to be a homewrecker just because they are poor.What more can I do?UPDATE: The squeaky wheel gets the grease. After reporting again, the sherif and deputy have come out to talk with the neighbors. They assessed the animals and had a long conversation with the woman about them. The cops called me back and explained a few things. Firstly, she lied through her teeth about the treatment of the animals. According to her, they are regularly fed and rotated. They always have water, and they are put in the barn at night. The officer has told me to document everything I see, to not remain anonymous, and to call back regularly so that evidence may build. He was apauled at the conditions of the horses as well, but has no way of taking action without records and tangible evidence. I will do what I can. Hopefully they just wake up and take care of them.

" lied to a recruiter and got the position I will be monitoring this heavily for any replies so please ask any questions and I will provide as much detail as possible.I am in the US, specifically in Ohio. I have been interviewing for a bit with a recruiter. This recruiter works at a independent firm that works with employers to find good employees. He gets a percent of my negotiated salary from the employer when I start. So no money comes from me.Let me add context about me and my position, I am an engineer and young for my position but am very bright and good at what I do. Everyone I interview with also gets this impression and is very impressed with me. However I have no formal education and am entirely self taught. This was made clear to everyone involved. My current employer took a shot with me in my position and was very happy with himself since he had me hired at a low rate doing pretty sophisticated work. I knew that I was getting a bit of the butt end of stick compensation wise - however since I am without schooling I thought it would be good to work here and it was fair. I have worked there for the past 4 years.Originally my current employer told me that Engineers make 60k a year here. However this was a lie and all of our engineers make below that and are remote. When negotiating I argued for 50k as I thought that it was fair. They accepted and I've been on that salary for over 3 years. (Starting there I made less).When talking with the recruiter I lied about my current salary and said that I make 67K and do some other work that will edge my total income out to close to 75K. I did not think much of it at the time.I thought it was a good time to look for what was available for me now since I have some experience under my resume. The recruiter was able to find me two positions recently that he thought I'd be a good fit for. I did an interview with each and they both really liked me, the first one I will refer to as Company A, said I would hear back by the end of the week. Company B also very much liked me and wanted me back for a second round interview with their team. Company B had a person from their team need to take vacation time so they postponed my interview out another week.Talking with the recruiter he had said it would be a good idea to use the interview with Company B to get Company A to give an offer that you wont refuse and asked me for a number. I said 100K. The recruiter said that Company A really loved me and accepted the 100K for me not to do the other interview with Company B. The recruiter reached out and told Company B I was given an offer.The next day I learned they accepted they sent me an official offer for 100K. The offer itself just went over what benefits they offered the 100K salary and the start date. Plus some formal language about being happy to have me work for them. Nothing in the offer had anything about contingencies. There line about attached Employee benefits but none were attached. On face value everything looked good here. Knowing they were excited to have me and that they were more than willing to give me the 100K I was excited. I signed the offer of employment and returned it to them.After I signed the offer, I let my current employer know I accepted another position and am putting in my two weeks. My boss was super cool about it and was glad to see me doing well.Today I got some documents asking for employment history and starting salary and ending salary. I have no idea what the recruiter may have said to Company A about my current salary. I am worried that the recruiter mentioned my ""75K"" current salary I lied about and Company A thinks that is what I am making. I have no intention of lying in writing about my current salary and will provide them with only factual information. I have never communicated with Company A my current salary. My fear is that learning my current salary may affect how they feel about having me work for 100K as I am doubling my salary.",0

" LOA- How are health care provider forms verified? What can I do? Am I at the mercy of my employer? My 5yo developed a medical condition. I had a phone appointment with her doctor and after describing it, her doctor determined that it could only be one thing, and that she would need surgery to correct it. The doc informed me that there is a good chance they will want to do the surgery same/next-day when we meet the surgeon.My employer, due to staffing shortages and the holiday season would not grant me use of my vacation time, and I have used all my sick time for the year. The day of the appointment with the surgeon I began a family care LOA. After meeting with the surgeon he told us his scheduling person would call us in the next 48 hours to schedule the surgery. When the scheduler called 3 days later, they told me the doctor noticed she had cold symptoms so he wanted to push the surgery to December since the surgery was not as urgent as they originally suspected. So now it has been 5 days  since I started my LOA.When I gave the office my health care provider certification form, they basically told me the doctor was not going to sign it, but that he would write a doctors note (which my employer will not accept.)A woman who worked in the office felt bad for my situation and offered to sign the paperwork herself, but she was just a secretary.  If I have her sign the paperwork, what are the chances my employer will or will not accept it. What are my options? do I have any? Im scared im going to lose my job if they deny my LOA and apply the attendance policy.   I am full time, been employed for over 2 years, and the forms provided to me by hr are for FMLA. In this was the healthcare provider certification.(which I was told my doctor will not sign, and I already refused the doctors note. my plan was to ask  one of the nurses to sign it the day of the surgery.)Im concerned that if I do not provide them with the certification they will deny the LOA.

" Management Stealing Tips For some back story, I am a CSR at a large dog boarding facility in Minnesota that caters to wealthy healthcare employees. A typical night stay is around $80. Our general manager is the husband of the silent owner of the company. He has never worked in this compacity and makes decisions based on youtube videos he has watched without consulting the rest of the staff.We recently upgraded our card readers to the new Clover readers and we now have a tip function which we did not before. When we push a transaction to the card readers the readers now ask the customer if they would like to leave a tip for the boarding stay. We did not think that customers would really use the function but we accrued around $3,000 in tips in less than a month.I heard some rumors that management was planning on using that money towards company parties and upgrading equipment for the business. I have worked in HR and have taken over some roles here including advising the general manager on HR-related topics. I printed off and explained Title 29, Subpart D - Tipped Employees § 531.50 to my General Manager. He asked me if we really needed to tell the employees that they are being tipped since most don't actually know since it is new. I told him yes we did and he told me I was a purist and that I interpret the law differently than he does.Even knowing our employees are paid over minimum wage and have not signed anything regarding tips they are still entitled to receive those tips correct? They are paid bi-weekly, how soon after those tips are processed do they have to be disbursed to the employees? Management has been sitting on these tips for several pay periods trying to figure out how to use them. Also, who would be the best to contact if they do decide to not give the tips to employees?",0

"Question on Imputed Tips My job is moving to putting digital tips on paychecks instead of pulling it daily from registers.

I’m a bit confused as how that works because on the paystubs “Imputed Tips” has always been on the income portion as an addition, not a subtraction or as a tax.Along with cash tips, tips are really minimal, 80¢-$1/hr., so nobody ever declared higher tips. If it’s a positive addition on the paystub, is anyone actually saving money by not declaring higher? Just confused on how it works.",2

"Can I sue my uncle for wrongful death from COVID. This is a hypothetical question based on a real situation from someone I know. (No one actually died from Covid in the original scenario) and I will tell it from my perspective.So I have an uncle who, over Christmas time found out him and his children had Covid. Rather than tell everyone and skip out on the family Christmas get together, and lied saying they were fine. They took some cough and cold medicine before coming to make the symptoms seem less severe. And upon questioning stated they just had a cold. My wife and I were wearing masks except wen eating and have been vaccinated, but she still managed to catch covid, most likely from my uncle. (I'm still safe so far.) After the gathering we found out that they already knew they had covid prior to joining us, but didnt bother to tell usThat's all the details of the actual scenario.My question comes from if my wife, or children were to have caught covid from my uncle, and ended up dying. Would that be enough grounds for a civil lawsuit for wrongful death, or at least to pay the hospital bills or for lost wages due to missing work?I do know that in civil cases, the burden of proof is often much lower than a criminal case, but I was unable to find any precedent for similar types of cases.

"Math question: still here because it has to do with finance. Idk read it, hopefully you have some insight Hey guys so you know how people say that when you're younger you should make riskier investments? This makes logical sense right because compound interest. A risky 100x increase on your $200 NFT would give you $20,000 that if invested at 19 would grow to be pretty decent over time. Whereas that $200 wouldn't matter much even with compounding so the loss is less damaging in the long term. The point is that if you assume you invest a risky investments winnings in a compounding investment then the risky investment gets better returns when looking at it from the endgame perspective based off the time.So this got me thinking. Does that mean that there's a mathematically speaking, appropriate amount of income to gamble? Let's take American Roulette for example where odds are 47.37% chance of 2x and 52.63% chance of 0x. Those are obviously bad odds. But if we assume that 2x is invested in the S&P500 for 30 years after then that 2x actually increases. And all we have to do to make gambling in our favor is increase the expected outcome to be above 2.11x.Now maybe the opportunity cost doesn't quite add up. but let's add in the factor of increasing incomeAssume you have a month t for every month from t_0 to t_n. And your income can be expressed as a function of t.For ex. income at month t = f(t) = 5,000t/12 (you steadily increase income to make 5k more a month every year. Idk you're really on your grind in this thought experiment).So now there's two possible things for you to do with any amount of income each month.1). invest in index fund. Assume 7% APY compounding monthly2). bet on red in Vegas. Using odds above. Any winnings go to invest in index fund. ( or we could recursively repeat this process with winnings until we reach a minimum bet amount for the table or lose)",2

At the time of purchase, 6-month LIBOR was 7.5%.In order to purchase the floater the investor borrowed funds by issuing a 5-year note at par value with a fixed semi-annual coupon of 7.0%.Based on the above information, I wish to understand the following questions:-a) With respect to the above transaction, assuming that there is no credit or liquidity risk, under what interest rate scenario can the investor lose money?b) The investor feels that he will be able to offset the above risk using an interest rate swap. Is is possible? If yes, should he enter into a payer or receiver position?c) Can the investor use interest rate options to offset the above risk? If so, should he buy a semi-annually resetting cap or a semi-annually resetting floor? What should the minimum or maximum strike price be in such a case?d) Suppose that the investor enters into a 5-year interest rate swap in which the investor pays LIBOR. The swap rate is 7.3% and the frequency of the payments is semi-annual. Will the investor gain or lose due to this transaction? Determine the net annual cash flow for the investor?e) What is the nature of the counterparty risk associated with the floater and the interest rate swap? Describe one way to hedge or mitigate such a risk in each case?",2

"How could Royals really be the richest people in the world? This isn't completely a finance question, but let me explain:I saw a video saying that the way we measure wealth at high levels is flawed, since we focus on shares of public companies. But rather, they say, the real wealth lies in people such as royals, who hold a large share of the wealth of an entire nation.However, I'm confused by this theory. In the United Kingdom, at least, properties like Buckingham Palace are not the property of the King(feels quite weird to say that) but rather the ""Crown Estate"". The way I understand it, this means that such properties as Buckingham Palace do not belong solely to the reigning Monarch, but to all the future Monarchs who will inherit these properties. Therefore, the Monarch cannot sell such estates, as that would rob all the future royal generations of their right to have these estates in the future.Wouldn't this mean that Kings and Queens do not own---at least in the same way---these Royal properties in the same way that Jeff Bezos owns a share of Amazon or Elon Musk owns a share of Tesla?",2
"I MIGHT OWE MY MENTOR SOME MONEY.... Okay so this morning I woke up to a call from my mentor that was rather unpleasant. Just a backstory I am 19 years old about to turn 20 at the end of this month. I'm actively doing my best to get started in becoming a real estate investor. So I networked with many people and was able to find a mentor who was nice enough to help me get started. He asked me to drive about an hour away (Brampton, ON to Kitchener, ON, Canada) to see some of his properties (duplex conversions then BRRRR which is exactly what I am looking to do).Long story short I exchanged value for value by doing little jobs here and there, which also helped me get exposure to the work contractors are able to do. i find this appealing because when I start having to find contractors, I know how much work needs to be done and can pay them accordingly. So I did a fairly easy job (digging a hole to find the conduit that connects to the house and main powerline) and he ended up paying me (which he didn't have to but did it out of kindness and promised to pay me more once the deal started cashflowing after the renovations).So, my dad started a side hussle as a scrap metal person and because of this my mentor was willing to give us some copper pipes (copper is worth a good amount) and a full central a/c unit (also worth a good amount). So here's where it gets messed up. The day before he told me to go in the basement of one of his houses to pick up the copper pipes where these other contractors I met the day before were doing a job. They helped us cut up some of the pipes to fit in our truck and then made sure to disconnect the a/c unit so we could take it. So we took out everything and left and everything was fine for 2 weeks. Then I get a call from my mentor saying we took the WRONG a/c unit and it was the one at another property he has and we were all lost for words on what to do next.It was a miss communication because he said in Whatsapp voice note that ""the copper pipes would be in the basement of the house and the contractors will know you and your dad are coming and the a/c unit is at the back of the house and I'll send you the address so no need to knock on the door and no one should bother you but call me if you have any problems."" The issue is I thought he was talking about the first house not a different one and also he never sent me a different address (otherwise I would've realized to let my dad know we have to go to two houses).My dad is currently at work now and I told him this and of course my mentor knows that we both don't have the money to pay for it (even though I am doing my best to find a way) but he said he feels bad saying that he regrets helping someone because of the situation he is in now (the contractors and partners are all blaming me and telling him that I should be the one paying for it) . The issue is he is using someone elses money for the property and its kind've a messy situation for the both of us. My dad said he talked to a guy that may have one but hes firm on the price. I don't want my mentor to have to pay for anything but I wouldn't be able to pay for much. I'm doing my best to be optimistic but I feel terrible for messing with something this big especially after everything hes helped me with (and was willing to do more; like let me see numbers and other deal etc. - which might not be the case now). My parents are both not home yet but some points they made is"" everyone is trying to blame you indirectly"" even though my mentor wasn't too clear on his communication (didn't send an address) and I failed to realize the a/c unit was actually located at a different property.",1
" / Time clock rounding violation? My coworkers and I have been noticing an average of 5-10 minutes being stolen from our clock time almost every day due to time clock rounding. I went back a year of my timesheets alone and ran the math. I only lost out on about 5 hours of time overall, but my co workers are losing on average, an hour a pay period (bi weekly). 76% of the time it works to benefits my employer, the rate seems to be higher for my co workers, who work more hours than me. I’m sure it’s in violation of labor laws, but I’m not sure where to go next with this.One thing that I can’t seem to find an answer for is why our employer would use a different time rounding amount in the morning for clock in, than in the afternoon. We have a 10 minute rounding in the morning, but 6 minutes in the afternoon. It’s a bit over my head, but we want to know what we’re talking about if we take this to HR, this just doesn’t make sense to me. Any feedback is helpful.

"What is considered fair use vs trademarked for things like t-shirts or other merchandise Just a little bit of background. My wife is an artist who paints all kinds of realistic and surrealistic paintings. She has done a series of paintings of things like fish, food menus, iconic movie scenes. One of the things she also does is paintings with cars. About a year ago we decided to start putting her artwork on t-shirts using online marketplaces like RedBubble, Threadless and Teespring. This is where we started running into problems. As paintings, her pieces are fair use. They are truly her designs and portray scenes like a surf van or an old golf. But we seem to be running into a fair use gray area with merchandising. VW, Volvo and other car companies have filed to remove her artwork from our online stores. At first we thought it had to do with the titles and tags since they did have the names of the cars, but then they started filing takedown notices for things like ""Surf Trip"" which is a design of highly customized van with surfboards on top that was inspired by a VW bus. This piece at no point had the VW trademarks or any badging or logos. It depicts a van that was inspired by a VW Vanagon but is altered in ways that VW never produced. So that piece still got taken down.Redbubble and these merchants are no help here. They just act like a proxy. They will take down a piece and then if we want to dispute it, they just put us directly in touch with the complainer and we are to work it out. Since were really not making any money yet off these pieces, we have steered clear of getting into any legal battles, but what we really could use is some guidance here.When it comes to artwork, the fact that its an artists own rendition (not just a copy of a photo or a copy-written design)  is enough to classify it as fair use, but with merchandising we're swimming a little blind. Can anyone clarify for us what would be the line between, its a tshirt thats featuring an artists own design that happens to have a car in it, vs its a shirt that infringes on trademarks due to the presence of the car.

After being at this job a few years she’s recently been promoted to supervisor. Lately, she has taken a relaxed position. She will NOT educate anyone on the team when issues arise because she doesn’t want to work the hours. Our office operates 24/7 and she will not address issues with night shift because of her hours. The director will also not do any education. My supervisor continuously sends out a generalized email anytime something happens and adds harder protocols /stipulations to the entire team. Since i have been there the longest aside from my supervisor she makes me educate team members but they will not listen to me. I have reported issues time and time again. Aside from this, i feel i know my job well. However, anytime someone makes a complaint to my supervisor she will take note of it and tell the complainer that “she will educate” said person that made the mistake. She will then get off the phone and tell this person they did what they were supposed to do. She does not investigate these claims or address any issue. She’s become inconsiderate by Permanently taking over another person’s desk and not notifying them this past week. This desk is always in use by the same 2 individuals. She left for an appointment before the next person arrived and left her personal belongings there. I did not get into that drama but I have been put in the position to listen to every complaint. I had to recommend to those individuals that they talk to her or the director. They took away our part time position that usually helps during busy hours because “our staff was being made to go home early too much”. Our supervisor is the only person in the office that leaves early. Everyone else works a full shift and gives report to the next person. Therefore we do not have the option to leave early. Everyone in the office has all realized the problems but will not speak up because our supervisor is very close with our director.

" Holiday entitlement Work advise Hi all, I'm unsure if anybody is able to help but would appreciate your input.I am currently employed by a company in the manufacturing industry (coming up to 1 year and 6 months currently) and a recent update to the company handbook states, ""upon 5 years’ service the employee will receive an additional 2 days holiday entitlement"", which is all and well.However, I have been employed by the same company previously for a period of 2 years and 1 month which ended when I was made redundant during covid, this was no fault of the company but purely down to the niche market supplied.The period in between the previous and current employment period is 9 months.Now after the release of the handbook update, I questioned HR whether my prior service would be considered.The response I received was my previous employment will not count due to leaving and breaking “continuous service”.Which I find quite unfair, do I have any sort of leg to stand on to fight this or will it be a waste of my time?",0
" Have a reasonable accommodation that is approved, but have a specific question I applied for and was approved for a reasonable accommodation through my HR office. I have had intermittent FMLA for migraine flare ups for years. Within the last year I applied for a reasonable accommodation (not being required to travel more than 50 miles per day for work and also not being required to work past a certain number of hours per week).My workplace has tons of employees so my accommodation does not have a huge problematic affect. With that said my accommodation was not signed off/approved using the same verbiage as my request. I had stated not to be required to travel more than 50 miles per day. My neurologist went a little above and beyond and in the reasonable accommodation request wrote ""... no travel required more than 50 miles from work site ..."". My HR department then wrote in the reasonable accommodation approval ""no travel 50 miles from work site."" I figured just leave it and not bother saying to change it to what I wrote (no more than 50 miles travel per day) because either works for my situation, even though I believe it is somewhat overkill.I am able to travel 100 miles in less than 24 hours - just need to take breaks. I have a lot of people, including my HR boss and my other bosses on social media. Could I even remotely get in trouble if I was to travel say 100 miles away and post on social media? For some reason I think I would because my accommodation says no traveling 50 miles from work site. My friend told me I am overthinking this, and that my workplace accommodation only is for when I am at work and I am free to travel 200, 300 or more miles a day on my off days.I then responded with ""maybe you are right, but maybe you are wrong. . . Since I have a restriction on the number of hours I can be forced to work, that would mean I cannot get a second job, correct?"" On that question they were a little more hesitant to say yes or no.So HR experts, am I free to travel and post on social media on my off days if I got above the travel restriction of what my HR boss approved? Nowhere in the travel restriction does it say anything about what I do on my time off, this is implied, in my opinion, only relating to my work hours.To be specific, if I travel more than 50 miles in a single nonstop sitting I about 75% of the time get a migraine. If I take a long break, I can travel another 50 miles. This is why in the original request I put this. It was my HR person who slapped on the no travel 50 miles from work site.My other friend disagreed with my one friend and I and said I could absolutely get in trouble if I was to post a pic of me even 51 miles away...",0

"Question about contract allowance or not Please note before reading this, this is not discussing a lawsuit against doordash, I have no interest in suing doordash, this is a question about an arguement between reddit users, that are all drivers, not lawyers, and I want to know if I am right or the people arguing with me are right.United States,Here is the conflict. Someone asked if they could give out business cards for their cousins/friends etc when they dropped off doordash orders.Here are the 2 applicable parts of the independant contractors agreement with doordash, and I will highlight the important lines.II.4 As an independent business enterprise, CONTRACTOR retains the right to perform services (whether delivery services or other services) for other businesses, and CONTRACTOR represents that they advertise and hold themself out to the general public as a separately established business. The parties recognize that they are or may be engaged in similar arrangements with other businesses to supply the same or similar services and nothing in this Agreement shall prevent CONTRACTOR or DOORDASH from doing business with others. DOORDASH does not have the right to restrict CONTRACTOR from performing services for CONTRACTOR’s own business, other businesses, customers, or consumers at any time, even if such business directly competes with DOORDASH, and even during the time CONTRACTOR is logged into the DOORDASH platform so long as such services do not otherwise violate this agreement. CONTRACTOR’s right to compete with DOORDASH, or perform services for businesses that compete with DOORDASH, will survive even after termination of this Agreement.Many arguments about it come from the following also in the ICA:II.9 By using the DOORDASH platform, CONTRACTOR also agrees to be bound by the DOORDASH Customer Terms of Service and that any breach of the DOORDASH Customer Terms of Service will be considered a breach of this Agreement. However, to the extent that this Agreement and the DOORDASH Customer Terms of Service conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.The arguments state that since we have to agree with the customer terms of service, this applies:(From the Customer Terms of Service)4(f) You will not use the Services, or any content accessible through the Services, for any commercial purpose, including but not limited to contacting, advertising to, soliciting or selling to, any Merchant, User or Contractor, unless DoorDash has given you prior permission to do so in writing.",1
"Remote working and taxes - why would a business not ""relocate"" to a low tax state? What about an employee? The lockdown has forced many companies to go fully remote, or at least open up to it. So I'm wondering how a few scenarios would work:Consider a high tax state like NY. Originally, company had a physical presence. All employees lived in that state, going to office. Everyone pays NY state taxes, both personal income and corporate. By 2021, company realizes they can function 100% remote. It doesn't make sense to pay for an office lease anymore.So suppose I want to move to Wyoming or Nevada, a state without income taxes, and purchase 10 acres of land for the cost of a studio in Manhattan. How would my taxes work? Do you pay taxes to the where your work was done? Or do you pay taxes to the state your work was done in, but then get a refund for minus the difference in your local states taxes? In this case, how is where my work is done defined, because it is fully remote - or consider this possibility:Suppose the company ""relocates"" to Wyoming or Nevada. Remember, no more physical office. This is a purely digital company with employees scattered all over. Again, how would taxes work? How does official relocation work in this case? It surely can't be tied to the residential address of your CEO, because consider a 2019 scenario where a business hires a remote CEO.",2
"Medical Assault and Battery - Do I even have a case to make? Last year was hard on everyone, myself included. I have depression and anxiety and had a crisis that resulted in me going to an inpatient facility. My time at the ER prior to my transfer though was very traumatic.From the moment I came in and was initially evaluated by a nurse, a security guard escorted me to get labs and go to the psych floor. She taunted me and made fun of me because I was shaking with fear and afraid of the needle for blood test.When I got to the psych floor, I was not told what was happening or what to expect, just given a chair. When I asked when I’d be going home, the floor nurse said “not any time soon” and left it at that. I panicked, said they couldn’t hold me against my will (although technically I was a 1013), but continued to cry and shake in my chair. Security, including the guard from previously, came in and threatened to sedate me if I didn’t calm down. Shockingly I didn’t calm down at this, and they grabbed me aggressively (I have photos of the leg bruise a week later), took me to a solitary room, pinned me to the bed, and the previous guard was the one to administer the sedative.I was not a danger to anyone, I was not threatening or violent. They should not have threatened the use of medical restraint nor used it. And unless that guard was trained in medication administration, she should not have been the one to sedate me. I got my records back and they claim I was agitated and threatening.I just don’t know what to do or where to start. I and every mentally ill person who has been medically assaulted to control them deserves justice, but I don’t know the steps to take. I’ve reached out to local lawyers but because I didn’t die or lose a limb, they aren’t interested in helping me. What can I do?",1

"What’s the likelihood of me qualifying for state insurance under the guise of disability? Before anyone comes after me, let me say this. I am employed, going to school, and trying to help out my newly divorced father with living expenses. I pay taxes on every one of my paychecks, have been since I first started working at 16 (almost 18 now). I live in the state of Oklahoma and have been enrolled in the soonercare program since I was an infant. They have covered what would have been a hospitalization that costed thousands of dollars back in 2020 due to a suicide attempt. I am incredibly grateful for what soonercare has done for me. I am eligible for the insurance until I turn 19, and then have to apply for the extension. I’m not sure if my household income will be able to get me an extension because last year, when my mom was still living with us, we were making a lot more money, of course. I’m not sure if I qualify as an adult without the disability yet. If I did not, can anyone tell me whether the severity of my depression will qualify me for disability pay? -have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety since I was 12 -first psychiatric hospitalization when I was 12 -in August 2020, I almost died of a kidney failure due to a suicide attempt (overdose). I spent about 11 days in OU childrens, 3 of which where in ICU. -after discharge, I was immediately admitted to another psychiatric facility for 1.5 month. -as a result, I have spent the past two years on multiple psychiatric medications. -the only diagnoses I currently have are anxiety and major depression. That being said I am recognized by a former therapist as having a high possibility to be diagnosed with autism or adhd. -I am no longer in therapy. I was discharged over a year ago. -I am yet to seek out an actual diagnosis due to medical gaslighting and not being taken seriously by medical professionals.

"When language similar to ""crime against nature"" is used in a criminal law does that render the unnaturalness as an element of the offense and hypothetically would a defense based on the act being natural be a valid defense that could be argued in court? For instance suppose Lawrence hadn't been decided yet and a statue refers to ""unnatural carnal acts with mankind"". The defense tries to argue that the defendants are innocent because while they committed ""carnal acts with mankind"" they were committing ""natural carnal acts"" making them not guilty of ""unnatural carnal acts"". The defense then seeks to ask to call forth scientists to argue in court that homosexuality has a biological basis and is therefore ""natural"" and since the law only prescribes penalties for the act when it is unnatural that the defendant is innocent.Why was this strategy never tried before Lawrence (or was it?) and how would a judge react if it were tried? Would this be allowed to be argued in court at all and would it possibly work?",1

" FMLA ending, need to start Short term disability (std) leave immediately after Background: Wife has been with tech company in Midwest for 15 months and super stressed between work and caring for mom with dementia. She’s on FMLA now (paid parental care leave from work also kicks in for six weeks) and the 12 month period ends next month 11/15.Situation: Due to caregiving her mom and spending time in the nursing home and witnessing other patients and her mom’s poor health, she’s developed a debilitating anxiety and depression. Unable to sleep, heart palpitations and overall burned out. The doctors are suggesting she go on psych meds ( Zoloft) and also asking her to take some time off to relax and recuperate.Decision: she has decided to continue with her work leave beyond FMLA. Doctor and friends have advised she transition into a short term disability (std) leave right after her FMLA ends, so that way it will be a smooth transition and she doesn’t have to go back to work and encounter any more stressors. Her STD is running concurrently with her Fmla so she will have 26-12 = 14 weeks of paid std remaining she can take.Question: can her employer fire her for taking the short term disability right after Fmla ? And even if they fire her will she be able to continue getting the short term disability? What other issues does she need to be mindful of.Thanks for your advise and comments. No trolling please, we are going through a lot already.",0
"UK Question Second hand Van. We have a close friend who is a part time/hobbyist van convertor. Buys a van and converts the interior into a camper van. We teamed up with him to buy a van and convert it. He is not a mechanic but has done a great job on a few previous projects. He bought a van with a full MOT, he had it for 6 months and we showed interest in buying it. He had a new clutch fitted and started on the interior. His family is part of our close knit community, we have no reason to doubt him, we think he has been duped like we have. He had the van for 6 months to fix it up for us. He gave it to us despite the fact we have not paid the full amount, which we would have paid on completion of the interior. Just took it for it's MOT to find the previous owner had used expanding foam and paint to disguise large area's of rust and rot on essential parts of the van. Including the mounts for suspension and the sills. The MOT garage have said it is a write off, it cost us the best part of 4k. My question. The previous MOT garage, why did they not flag up these issues?  They took a lot longer than 2 years to become apparent, we are talking about serious rot that would take a lot longer than a year. They were there when the van went through its MOT a year ago. Can we pursue this with the previous garage that passed it despite these issues? I do understand sold as seen, I am 4k out of pocket due to others being unscrupulous and deliberately hiding faults. I am already resigned to the loss, just checking just in case.

"My lawyer ghosted me and my trial is in two days. Help! VT Last September my wife kicked me out. She was the financial manager and breadwinner, so I had nothing but a few hundred dollars in my bank account and what chattel I could fit in the back of my truck in the course of a few hours. I was completely homeless for 4 months and committed myself to an intensive mental health program instead of taking my own life.  I came really close to committing suicide. Like really close.After spending months trying and failing to get legal help as a homeless and unemployed person the Vermont Bar Association found a low-bono attorney that was willing to take my case, and they provided a grant for the first 10 hours of his service.The lawyer and I had a few short conversations, and he did show up in court for a preliminary ""status hearing.""  Outside of that, he has been generally hands-off and unhelpful.  He always had an excuse for running behind the court's schedule and usually blamed ""technology"" on his inability to produce documents, etc.A month before the final court date I started trying to reach out to make sure that everything was in order.  No response.  Twelve emails and multiple calls later, still no response. Finally, I called the court to see if I could figure out what the hell was going on.  I didn't even know how and when to show up for court at that point!  My lawyer straight-up ghosted me.As it turns out, he also failed to submit the required financial affidavits (that I faithfully turned over to him in a timely manner), causing my wife's counsel to file multiple ""Motions to Compel Discovery,"" and eventually a ""Motion for Contempt and Enforcement and Motion in Limine.""  Because I am afraid of my abusive and spiteful wife, I made sure that she could not find my current residence or place of employment by insisting that all documents be sent to my lawyer, so I was never personally given notice of these actions.I figured out how to file a motion to continue on my own, and just left the status conference where I found out I will likely get granted a continuance come our actual court date on 12/1. It is unlikely that I will have no more than a month to retain counsel and start over with a new attorney.  It is for certain that I do not have the financial abilities to retain counsel.

•I’ve been lied to about parking for a year, accused of MULTIPLE FELONIES. • Had the police called on me bc a resident didn’t believe i belonged in the building (once) •Been called a NI&;R  (3x) •followed by a resident who thought I was sabotaging the elevator then pushed and told I’m black and therefore an idiot.(2x, the second time on video.) •I tried to not see this through a racial lens,  but I am one of less than 5 black people given the “privilege of even TOUCHING lease papers, let alone signing. AGAIN, I PAY 2000 A MONTH AND HAVE NEVER BEEN LATE.  In return,  instead of the same respect, security and care for wellness afforded to others, this is what I have paid for: • Despite knowledge of racial discrimination and cops called against me,  have never received a single call,letter,email or visit to check on my welfare. • When the too girls across from me felt threatened when I knocked on the door,  the manager IMMEDIATELY ran up to help THEM. Incidentally this was the first in person communication with the building manager and myself.Though I knew I had a right to be upset I was very careful with my communication but nevertheless I was immediately commanded to go back to my apartment because he perceived my anger as aggressionAnd threatened to call the police, The second attempt to communicate like adults with my neighbor ended with them calling security who threatened to call the police and report a hostile black man running around the hallway. Understanding it to be the death threat that it was I went inside and thank God I recorded The whole thing. •I was then threatened with eviction and put on probation if anyone else in the building feels uncomfortable around me or if I “ Attempt to enter another apartment again”.This was a blatant lie and I’ve felt targeted for vacation since then. •When I was stalked through the hallways pushed and called a dumb black man I gave a statement and a video to management. Despite reporting a hostile living environment I’m ignored for three weeks until I finally called just to be told he doesn’t know who to believe. The only thing he has said to “help “ me is that if I feel so uncomfortable all the time then I’m allowed to move early.I know I’m probably vague and will gladly clear up any confusion and can go into greater detail but from the evidence that I’ve read and looked up in Oregon at the very least he has ignored a reported hostile living environment not to mention. emotional distress and defamation.

"Cross post: pets, just need to vent A little over a year ago I was hospitalized for 2 weeks due to mental health reasons (it was due to ptsd, i am a 100% service connected disabled veteran). My dog, Lana (3yrs, f, lab/pit mix) was left in the care of my ex husband (divorced in 2014) while i was in patient. I didn't have anyone else to take her in and could not afford to board her. My ex assured me that my dog would be ok and that he would give her back to me when i was out of the hospital over phone calls when i was in patient. By the time i had gotten out of the hospital he had moved to a different state. He assured me that he was still going to bring my dog back to me. After giving me the reassurance, he began ignoring my calls and texts. We also have a 13 yr old son together so i was getting authorities involved over not having any contact with my son, when he finally told me that my dog was gone. She had gotten out of his home and run off. He hadn't seen her in at least a week. Look, it's been just over a year and i just found out less than a week ago that he LIED to me. My dog is ALIVE. My son is visiting with me for the summer and his phone has photos of my dog (service animal) cuddled up with my ex 5 months after he told me she disappeared. I have filed a police report, but he lives out of state so getting him arrested isn't going to happen. The police report will be available to me next week and he has admitted that it is my dog, he admitted that he took her from me. He is claiming that i abandoned my dog when i went in patient. I am already aware that that won't hold up for shit. Now, the only reason i believed it to begin with is because our son told me he had not seen my dog at his dad's. After i showed my son the pictures he confessed that he was instructed to lie to me by his father and he was scared of what his dad would do to him if he told me the truth. I just really needed to vent this because i am so damn frustrated over it. Why keep my dog from me? Before i fiked the police report i told him to just give me my dog back and he denied having her. Then when the police questioned him he admitted the truth. The pictures i have seen of my dog since being in his care show that she is very over weight and she has large bald spots and scabs from ripping out her fur. The pictures are as recent as may 2021, right before my son came to visit with me. I am so happy that my dog is alive, and at the same time devastated that i have to now SUE him to get her back.i live in the usa, louisiana, he is in texas, i have reached out to the LA bar association to see if i can get any assistance or if they can at least point me in the right direction*",1

I currently live in FL, my partner is currently living on the property in an RV.  I have about $100k to invest in the property and found a reasonably priced manufactured home to put on it.  Although I paid for the property (about $30k), my partner's name is on the deed.What we have discussed is putting the property into a land trust to protect the property from creditors and other issues that may affect the property or my home in FL.  My partner agrees with doing the land trust and putting the deed of the property into the trust.  I am in my 60s and expect to retire out there if I live long enough. I want to make sure that my partner keeps rights to the property in case I get run over by a bus.My question is do I need a lawyer for this or is this something I can do myself.  I do have a small business registered in FL, do I need a new business entity in WA to serve as the Trustee?",1
"Trying to understand CTD bonds for interest rate futures I found this question with an interesting chart in the answers that describes conversion factors:https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/33199/when-a-particular-bond-is-delivered-why-there-is-the-need-to-define-a-conversioI can understand that conversion factors adjust what the long pays on delivery, but the short is delivering what they want buy buying it and that is not affected by the conversion factors?  So how is it an even trade?In the first chart in that example and assuming I am short, it looks like I can go into the market and with no yield shifts (x axis = 0) I can buy the 4% for around $90.  In the second chart the conversion factor makes it so that the long always pays around the same price which looks to be around $100 with no yield shift.  But doesn't the short get to buy at $90 still?I guess the assumption I'm making is that the conversion factor only affects the long.  And I get that from the CME here:",2

"Is it illegal to change the repair after an insurance claim? Hey, Michigander here, so a rental property of mine had vandalism on the sliding glass door. There was damage on the frame and glass. We sent in an estimate for both the frame and glass. I don't want to pay the $2,500 deductible and it will take 2-3 weeks to get the glass. If we get the frame and glass, it'll take 2-3 months. If we replace the frame it'll cost like $4,000. If we replace just the glass, it'll cost like $1,000. If I replace the glass, I'll be making a profit from the insurance payment, with the deductible already remove. If I replace the frame and glass, I'll lost $2,500 due to the deductible. Can I just replace only the glass? The tenant says he wants the glass, as it will mean his sliding glass door is only boarded up for 2-3 weeks and not 2-3 months. Please help.",1

" When do I give notice and how do I ensure a good reference from a boss that will be mad I’m leaving? I work in education as an instructional coach in Texas, and I’m an “at will” employee that is not under contract. I’m transitioning to a career in learning and development and just signed an offer to work at a very larger multinational consulting firm. The next step is the background check, which includes a reference check. I’ve been a good employee with no performance issues or disciplinary actions of any kind for my entire tenure (4 years). In general, my direct supervisor, the principal, likes me and praises my work. However, in the past when teachers have left mid-year, she tells us to discourage them, or at least not be supportive, and we have been told explicitly not to write reference letters if they ask. She tells us to remind them that they signed a contract. They did not, as our offer letter each year explicitly states we are “at will”.  I’m fairly certain she’s not going to be happy with my decision to leave mid-year.Here’s my dilemma:The new company did not explicitly ask me to provide references when applying, although they still could in the coming days. Best case scenario,  they use an outside firm that fact checks what’s on my resume generally through HR in some way. Either way, I don’t want to give notice before the background check goes through, especially given my principal’s attitude about this in the past. I also don’t want to blind side her if they do reach out to her directly for a reference. I’m afraid she might somehow sabotage it. I know she can’t say any untruths, but maybe she just won’t respond, and I’ll risk losing my current job. I assume this is a pretty common scenario. Any advice on how I should deal with it? Is this something I could explain to my recruiter and get their take, or would it come off as a red flag to them in some way? I’m probably overthinking this but would be devastated to lose this opportunity. I also really love and respect the team I currently work with (despite my bosses shortcomings regarding employees leaving) and don’t want to burn any bridges. I would love to let current employers know asap so I can help set them up for success ideally.",0
"Company I used to work for is in route to an IPO So years ago after working for a food manufacturer for years they announced that they were going to give employees shares in the company. Depending the role you had in the company and the amount of time you spent there influenced the amount of ""shares"" you were to get if the company went public. Just recently a paper released that this company I used to work for is possibly in line to go file under an IPO.I was guaranteed a specific amount of shares in this event but the problem is that the only thing I had been provided, like all of us, was a paper that stated how many we were going to be given. The paper is not in front of me and I think it is with my EX at my old house. I would assume this is a reasonable amount of money that was basically typed on a piece of printer paper and hoped to be lost. In the event I can not find said promise letter is that going to jeopardize any sort of investment I had? I would call the company but I figure that would not get me far because I was let go and that these guy probably did not keep any sort of record at all on this matter because I think my mother contacted them years ago when I was in the hospital to ask about these ""shares"" and they said that they were going to 'send' something in the mail but that never happened.Has my 8 years of time and investment with this company lost or is there a legal way to pursue this?",1

" I have the unique opportunity to basically create my dream job at current employer, but unsure what an appropriate title & salary would be. A little background before going into my main question. I’ve been at my current job about 4 years as a consultant/auditor. My pay caps out at about 150k when factoring in bonuses and other benefits. When I joined the team, we were about 12 people and had virtually no processes, quality control, efficiencies or automation for our work. Over the course of the past 2 years or so, I’ve spent personal time building some tools that are now used by most people on the team. We’ve since grown, going through 2 acquisitions, and now we are a division within a 400+ employee firm. Our division is split into 3 main teams totaling over 60 people.I was recently offered the opportunity to create a new job within the company to continue improving processes, implementing efficiencies, build our department knowledge tools/library, and continue building automation of workflows for all 3 teams in our division (previously only did this for one team on my own time). We currently net about $8MM/yr in revenue, with growth expected to take us over $15MM next year.I am not sure what type of job description would best encompass all of these tasks, nor what “level” would be appropriate. I was thinking something along the lines of “Director of Knowledge management and process improvement” or something to that effect. Given our net revenues and the magnitude of the job, as well as my current pay, would a salary ask of $200-220k be too high? Or should I ask for more?Thank you!",0

Right now I work with another third party that supports the same tech company but in the business space rather than the consumer space.What this means is that SOMETIMES we end up having to collaborate with my old team. My new team is amazing. They’re supportive, celebrate me, and they’re so proud to have me on the team. My old boss (not necessarily team) has been the worst. Where I am warm and welcoming when trying to work with him, he is cold and dismissive. He tries to prevent me from making connections, has accused me of poaching (people are just quitting because they don’t want to be there), has attempted to send me a text saying that I can’t do certain things and I need permission from his parent company leaders (I have my parent company’s leadership permission).I’m so filled with anxiety that his actions are going to cause my new team to look at me like I’m bringing negativity to the team or I’m bringing drama.

" surgery and time off I work in Illinois, live in Wisconsin. I am a salaried employee with lots of PTO. Here is my situation:In August I notified my boss and HR in writing that I would have an upcoming surgery, which they both acknowledged. At that time I put in for a week off for recovery, which was approved. I was told we have to use up PTO before FMLA, no problem, I have the time.In September I sent a reminder email to both of them, and at that time explained that my only restrictions were to be driving and lifting, but I would be able to WFH as long as I wasn't on pain meds or having complications (which I'm not).

"my original tenant is trying to evict us but did not go thru the court? ok long post but i really need some legal help in this situation 😕 we live in a sublease agreement that may/may not even be legal in Georgia. we have established residency and been here for almost a year, and have been living thru a verbal agreement, which she has broken constantly. bc of that we told her we wanted a written agreement and would only sign it if a sheriff came down and mediated our conversation so there were no misconceptions ab the law or our rights, something she agreed to. she later then texted us a pdf of a random sublease agreement and told us to have it signed by a certain day if we wished to continue staying there, which violated our verbal agreement of staying thru August regardless of the lease, which is still unsigned. i told her she needed to provide me a printed copy bc im conventional that way, unless she could provide a secure portal in which i could e-sign this lease. never once did i say i wouldn’t sign it, but she was rude and told me to print it out myself???? for months our original tenant has been very shady on the rent and bills. i address them with her respectfully, telling her that i can’t just send her $ without knowing how much i’m actually paying and she told me she wanted a lump sum every month but that would not account for the fluctuation in bill amounts- so she would just pocket that extra money (she has no job and hasn’t had one for the entire time we’ve lived here) against our wishes and rights as tenants and the verbal agreement we had. she is immediately hostile with me and my other roommate whenever we bring up the rent and our issues with it, which is shady in itself. this month we both agreed to not pay this “cleaning fee” that she’s been imposing on us because we noticed that no cleaning service came so it was really just us paying her to clean the things she makes dirty considering i never use the common areas and my other roommate is rarely at the house. after detailing that we would no longer pay that fee she said that it wasn’t even for a cleaning fee anymore and was something else entirely (the same exact amount??? that’s suspicious!) but she had not given us notice for that or discussed it with us at all so we don’t owe her that money. after verbally harassing me while illegally occupying my rented space without my consent and while i continually told her to exit, she texted my roommate and I eviction notices and slid them underneath our doors for failure to pay rent and for breaking the lease and had to leave in 30 days. is any of this right??? i paid her the full amount of rent and utilities that had already been discussed and agreed upon sans the cleaning fee so that’s a nonfactor and we never signed the lease because it was never provided in an appropriate fashion then negotiated like leases are supposed to be. she also said if we attempted to contact the owners she would evict us, and the day after i called the owners because THEY wished to speak with ME we get these notices, which seems like a retaliatory eviction to me. she hasn’t filed anything thru the court and she has been witnessed throwing away my personal belongings, which she seems to think is ok bc she “gave notice” for me to move my belongings out of a room that has been reserved for my roommate who told me it was fine to have my things there until she moved her stuff down into that room to gain distance between her and this girl.

" Will accuser learn there was counter-evidence? Hello,A few months ago I (male) was brought into an HR investigation; my accuser was both a close professional and personal friend (female). I was very surprised at this. The accusation was essentially that I asked her about her personal life when she had said not to, and that I was uncomfortable and inappropriate with her via text messages.As the questioning of me started, I answered truthfully and mentioned that I had text messages from her sharing personal things like hobbies, initiating conversation with me, asking me to meet her for parts of a work event, and/or thanking me for things like medicine I gave her, etc--in other words proving that what she accused me of was not true. When I brought this up, the tone of the investigation changed and they were very eager for me to send HR screenshots of my text messages. I ended up sending almost two years worth of texts (we did not text all the time, but I still had ample evidence that she initiated things with me, etc.)When the follow-up occurred, I was cleared as there was no evidence to support her claim due to my evidence.My questions are:When she made the accusation, would she have had to provide any evidence (would seem odd since we both would have the same text conversation)when the accuser had her follow-up at the close of the investigation, would she have been told there was evidence proving she was not being truthful--and if so, would she learn the nature of what I was able to share?

" NYC Salaried Exempt - No pay for extra hours worked My husband is in a non-exempt role, 7hr day, 35hr work week. During a week with a company paid holiday, he worked an extra 2 hours. However, on his paycheck he was only paid for his standard work hours. The extra 2 hours were missing.Previously when he worked extra hours, he was always paid for that extra time worked regardless if there was time off in the same week. In this instance, he's not expecting 1.5x overtime pay. He's just expecting payment for those extra hours worked at his regular rate.When he inquired with HR on the missing two hours they told him that because there was 7 hours of holiday pay that week he was not entitled to the 2 hours of extra pay, because he is salaried non-exempt. He would have to work more than 7 extra hours that week to be entitled to extra pay.When he asked when his status changed to salary non-exempt they said he was always in this status but he was being paid incorrectly previously. In my mind, this qualifies as a change in status because he had always been paid as a standard non-exempt employee before. He should have been notified.It was also always my understanding that a non-exempt person should be paid for every hour that they work. However, I can't seem to find any definitive rules around ""salaried non-exempt"" when looking up FLSA laws.Is his HR dept breaking the law?",0

"I have a question about money earned online through music Hello! Without diving into too great a detail, I have a slight collaboration with someone who makes remixes of my music on Youtube, and they make money through ad revenue. For almost three years now, they have been re-creating my music for a larger audience (getting more views than my own channel, for example). I've been contacted by them, saying that because of my music they've made a substantial amount of money and want to pay me what I'm due for creative labor.Now, I'm cautious when it comes to international online money situations like this. Is it  a scam? What can I do? Obviously I want to get paid for my creative output, and this is much more than I've made through sheet-music sales. And I'm not going to give out my Paypal or physical address to get this money, but...I'm stuck.Apologies if this isn't the right sub for this question. Thanks in advance!",2
"Would this be destroying evidence? Let's say a person is driving and commits some driving violation while they have a dash cam and get pulled over by a police officer. During the traffic stop, the police officer does everything correctly, and in the course of questioning the driver, the driver willingly admits to the crime.Now let's say the only hard evidence of the admission is the dash cam footage from the camera owned by the driver, and in the court case concerning the event the prosecutors become aware of the fact that defendant admitted guilt and that the dash cam footage he owns. The prosecutors became aware of this through legal means and obtain a warrant to access that footage and use it as evidence in court.In each of these scenarios, please give your thoughts as it pertains to destroying evidence or obstructing justice:Before the warrant is issued, the defendant irretrievably deletes the footage but had no idea that it might be requested as evidence in the trial.Before the warrant was issued, the defendant irretrievably deletes the footage because he knows it could be used against him in court.The defendant heard about the warrant and irretrievably deletes the footage.For the next couple of scenarios, let's say this is the case: the defendant's camera is set up such that it would automatically and irretrievably delete the footage after a certain time had elapsed unless he specifically chose to have certain footage permanently saved. By the time the warrant to retrieve the footage was obtained, the automatic deletion of the footage had already taken place.Please give your thoughts like before in these scenarios:The dash camera set up is as it came from the manufacturer, and he was oblivious to how it might effect legal proceedings, and the manufacturer made that the default setting for the camera with the intention to just make economic use of data storage space without regard to how that might effect legal proceedings.The same as above, but the manufacturer specifically advertises the camera as performing this function so that no evidence against you will be accessible.",1
"I think my landlord might be pulling a fast one, what do I do? I have just noticed I haven't been sent a bill for the electric. When I moved in and tried to set one up I didn't have access to the meter and the landlord oddly didn't want me accessing it.Thinking about it the basement apartment isn't up for rent. One of the flats is owned by another landlord. The building wasn't originally designed to be mutable flats but atached houses.When I look up his company online all I can find is he owns property's and that's it.The thing that set off my suspicion is the meters and cables look a little fly tip junk from a hole in the floor. All different types of meters.Who's paying for electric? If he's leaching electric who's liable for its use. If I don't have access to set up a supplier how am I able to monitor my usage or is it going to be a unknown amount bill I will have to pay.Any advice would help.",1

"What should people know about the current events regarding GameStop? I see a lot of memes but relatively little substance as per discussion about this topic.I am genuinely curious to learn more simply because I feel like a lot of the conversations online are being had between people who don’t fully understand the likely fallout of the events currently unfolding.For example, who is actually likely to benefit?  I’ve heard from my brother in law who worked as a hedge fund manager that it’s actually the super wealthy who will ultimately benefit from what’s going on.  But I can’t reconcile that with what I am seeing with my own eyes online.Are every day folks at risk of losing retirement or pension dollars?  I heard that said on NPR but virtually every person I chatted with online says that pensions and retirement funds can’t be invested on shorts and/or this will only hurt the super wealthy.  (Which flies in the face of what my BIL said— and he is generally 100% spot on and doesn’t say much without having a very high degree of certainty.)Just generally trying to cut through the noise and better understand the most likely outcomes of these events.  Not asking for a crystal ball just a no BS assessment from a status of now from someone who knows more about it then me.",2
"I program while at work but my job is commission sales would there be any question who owns the code? So I work commission sales, sometimes it gets slow, and there are no customers in the building, I do have other daily tasks that need to get done but usually these are mostly limited to opening and closing (cleaning, making sure deliveries are good to go etc) so they get done. The tasks that aren't limited to those I usually get done as they come up since they are usually just customer issues that need to be tracked down. So sometimes during these slow times I pull out my own laptop and program on some personal projects until a customer comes by (which could be in 10 minutes could be 6 hours).These projects are unlikely to ever actually make money or provide some amount of help to most people they are simply a way for me to build out a portfolio to someday get a job as a software developer and they are my own projects not someone else's open source projects; but, my question is who actually owns the code because this situation seems pretty similar to say the guy who made those Bratz dolls in the 2000s. I think there is enough that distances me from that; though, I did sign a non compete but as far as I'm aware this is only that I cant go to or start a competitor to the business I'm currently apart of for a period of 2 years, but one of the big things I think distances me from that is I work commission I do not get paid unless I sell to a customer (or if my commission is less then minimum wage which does happen from time to time in which case I get minimum wage).I'm not currently in any trouble with this right now and if I ever should be in trouble for this I know to actually get a lawyer.",1
"I think my boyfriend is being harassed by HR  This situation is so bizzare and I'm honestly just here for some advice because neither of us know what do. Basically my boyfriend (m 21) ""Greg"" recently started his first corporate job. About a month ago there was an anonymous complaint against him. HR told Greg that another male coworker thought he was ""adjusting his crotch too much.""We both thought this was not only a really strange complaint but also strange that HR was telling him not to adjust his own pants so much. Greg got worried so he started actively focusing on keeping his arms on the table while working and he kept waiting to adjust until he got to the bathroom. Just today he had a meeting with HR and his manager because another male coworker had the same complaint.(Important information to the story is that the only people who can see his crotch while he's working are the coworkers to his direct left and right. These coworkers of his are friends with each other and Greg has always gotten the feeling that they don't like him.)Greg now feels extremely uncomfortable. He has actively tried to resolve the problem (which was a weird issue in the first place) and now feels like people are paying attention to his lap all day. Both HR and his manager told him that they had noticed recently that his hands are always plastered to the desks weirdly and that the complaint was strange but because it was the ""2nd strike"" they had to have a meeting with him. They offered him no solutions to the issue and said that they had a no tolerance policy for 3 strikes. But this seems insanely bizzare to us.1st I think a workplace shouldn't be able to tell their employees how often they can adjust their pants.2nd if even HR and the manager admits the complaints are strange and they notice Greg is taking action then why are they acting as if the complaint is official.3rd Greg has no way of defending himself.What if a 3rd complaint comes in? This feels like workplace harassment and like HR is taking part in it. What are Greg's rights here? What can Greg do to defend himself against these frankly inappropriate complaints? Any advice is appreciated. ",0
" Salary negotiation taking longer than I expected. What's the holdup? I was offered a job last Friday at a company I have a high interest in working for. However, the salary they offered me was below market average for the position I would be filling.I told them I would need the weekend to think it over and that I have some concerns regarding the salary. HR seemed very willing to give me some time to think on it and begin negotiating on Monday of this week.Negotiating was fairly pleasant with no heavy pushback on my requests. They were slightly concerned with the salary I was asking for, but again they didn't really push back on it much.It is now Wednesday and I have not heard back from them yet. How long do negotiations usually take place? It's been a while since I've been in this position.ThanksEdit: they reached out to me today to let me know they are still waiting on certain approvals and I should expect an answer by early next week at the latest.",0
" drove company vehicle for 3 days on a suspended license. what should I do? A few years ago I got a DUI. My lawyer didn't settle until about 6 months after the incident and when he did my license was suspended. I didn't know license was suspended and drove company vehicle for a couple days before realizing my lawyer had settled and license was suspended. At that point I told the County what happened, DUI and everything. It took a few weeks but I eventually returned to work and everything was fine.Fast forward a couple years to this week. My auto insurance was canceled and the SR 22 that needs to be filed with DMV was canceled and my license was suspended. I didn't find out until after I had driven a company vehicle for 3 days. When I find out I didn't drive any longer and now my license is fine and valid.At my yearly annual review, HR runs my driving record or something and the license suspension will probably be mentioned along with DUI and other stuff. There's a chance they find license was suspended and check back and find out I drove county vehicle those days.Should I come clean or just wait and see if they find out? If they do find out, I could just say I didn't drive the company vehicle that day and they would have no way to prove I did. What should I do?",0

"Class action lawsuit against Agero Hello,In short, I'm paying for a roadside assistance service with State Farm and they partner up with another company called Agero. I waited for a tow truck and no one showed up for up to 7 hours when I was completely stranded in the middle of nowhere. They couldn't assign anyone for me and they also wanted me to pay extra for an ""out of network"" tow truck. AAA showed up within 45 mins. Agero offered $20 compensation for all of this which I refused.This is the full story...I'm from Oklahoma and I spoke with several different lawyers in regard to a class action against Agero. I have Agero as my roadside assistant via state farm. I have seen so many people having issues with them. I will explain my situation below and please share your experience as well. Let's make this stop for good. I will also want to mention that they offered me a $20 gift card as compensation which I refused.On Saturday, October 1, 2022, our car was disabled in the Wichita Mountains near Indiahoma, OK. There was no cellular reception where the vehicle was located, making a sticky situation even stickier. We were able to find a ride and cell reception at the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge Visitor’s Center approximately 6 miles from where the vehicle was disabled.At approximately 4:50 pm on October 1, 2022, I contacted Agero (State Farm provider/partner) for Roadside Assistance. After a somewhat long wait (high call volumes) I was able to reach a representative and set up a tow from Indiahoma, OK to Legend Honda in Lawton, OK. I checked the request online after receiving the text message, and the representative I spoke with put the vehicle location as the Visitor’s Center, and not actually where the vehicle was disabled despite being provided an address and the GPS coordinates. This may have just been a minor misunderstanding on their part, but we made it clear that we couldn’t wait with the vehicle due to lack of cell phone coverage, so we had to wait until the driver called us to let us know they were on their way before heading there (if something happened they wouldn’t be able to reach us nor would we be able to reach them).As soon as I realized this, I placed another phone call to Roadside Assistance and gave them the correct location of the vehicle, and the request was updated. No driver had been assigned yet. At about 5:30, we had to leave the visitor’s center as they were closed and had to close the gate to their parking lot, so at this point, we were illegally parked and waited on the side of the road as there was nowhere to go within a reasonable distance to the vehicle due to lack of cell phone coverage.I then remembered that I have Hondacare included with my bumper-to-bumper factory warranty for my vehicle, so I contacted them as well and opened a request for a tow with them. At this point, it was after 9 pm. Hondacare uses the AAA network, and we were given an estimated wait time of about 1 and a half to 2 hours max. No one had been assigned to my request at Agero (state farm partner) yet.Shortly after I made my request with Hondacare, I received a call from Agero (State Farm provider/partner) roadside assistance stating that they contacted all in-network providers and no one accepted the case.I was starting to get frustrated as it’s been over 4 hours already, and I am illegally parked, stranded in the middle of nowhere. The representative stated that no one in-network could take the request, but they could try again in 2 hours. We asked them to try again in half an hour, and they said they would. I was being very patient with them.We waited for another hour, then got another call from the Agero (State Farm provider/partner) Roadside Assistance representative. They said once again that no one was available to tow us. However, we could go out of network and pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket and then apply for reimbursement.We weren’t going to do that, we pay for a service that is supposed to provide us with towing that we pay monthly for, and we need to get this service that we are paying for. The representative also told us that there was one that may be able to come in 4 hours (that would put us at 12 am-1 am waiting time from the beginning at 4:50om). We asked that they keep trying. At this point, it was starting to get dark. Really dark since it was a mountain road.We waited another hour or so, and then called Agero once again. Given the situation, the representative escalated the request. I requested a supervisor, and the representative said she contacted her supervisor and there was a wait, and placed me on hold. In the meantime, my request seemed to magically have a driver assigned and we would have a 1-hour wait (this is after giving them a statement from a lawyer that I called so they provided me with a driver immediately after). Even more interesting, the tow company was the same one that was offered prior out of pocket for hundreds of dollars. I got sick of waiting for the supervisor and had the number of the tow truck driver in the request, so I reached out to them myself and it was confirmed that it would be about an hour as he was dropping a vehicle off in Lawton as we spoke then would head straight to us.An hour passed, and we contacted the tow truck driver again. He still has not left Lawton and was still dropping off the previous vehicle. This was getting fishy, but he told us another 30 minutes or so and that he would be there. I waited another 30 minutes, then called the driver again and they sent me to voicemail. At this point, I called Agero Roadside Assistance once again to see what was going on.Since it had been more than an hour and a half, Agero canceled that tow and started looking for another tow, they admitted that this should have been reassigned after 60 minutes.I requested to be transferred to a supervisor, and had a long wait time again, but was eventually transferred to Charlotte. While this was happening, I got a call from the owner of the towing company (Liberty Tow), stating that the payment card that was provided by Agero was getting declined and his employee wasn’t comfortable coming out to get us until this was resolved. This was guaranteed to be another half hour after this was resolved for them to get to us since they were coming out of Lawton and hadn’t left yet, so I told them to just not bother coming at all.I had a long discussion with Charlotte (supervisor) that this situation was unacceptable and she apologized for this satiation and said they were working hard as we spoke to find us another driver. After much discussion, she asked for 20 minutes and she or an associate would call us regardless of whether or not they found anyone. About 15 minutes after hanging up the phone with Charlotte, the tow from Hondacare showed up. They use AAA and they showed pretty quickly.After the driver from Hondacare got us out and we returned to cell phone coverage (about 11 pm), I checked the request with Agero and there still was no driver assigned to our case. I went ahead and canceled the request after an additional 2 hours just to see if someone would be assigned or not. Not a surprise here, as no one was assigned. I also have no record of ever getting a call from Agero after the 20 minutes I was told about. Upon checking further to be 100% sure, it appears that there was no call back from them.",1

" Fully disclosed past DUI and travel to Canada I asked this question in ask a lawyer where it’s very suited but would like feedback from an experienced HR person.Good morning.  I am an engineering working in Ohio.  February of 2020 I had a dui which prevents travel to Canada.  You have to have a temporary resident permit or rehab permit which takes time to process this.When I started this job I fully disclosed to my current boss and his boss I had this and at first declined the offer due to this.  I was told this was not an issue and to take the job by them, not the recruiter.Fast forward to three months ago.  A job was going on in Canada and I was asked to go.  I mentioned I couldn’t and sent him an email and his boss an email, ( which I saved, disclosing this.).   I told him in person about the temporary resident permit processing.  I told him I was unsure how long it would take.Fast forward to 11/11, last Friday.  I was asked formally in an email to make plans to go to Canada which I politely mentioned in the email I couldn’t due to passport issues.  The boss asked why I couldn’t go, about the personal details of why which I disclosed the DUI again, and reminded him I told him and his boss when I started.  He wanted to know all the details of what I was doing which I mentioned the temporary resident permit, etc.  He mentioned it was up to me to figure out how to get it done and the job done.  I was to report back to him on how I was going to cross the border.  (In his fit of anger and yelling he said I needed to go and lie at the border.  I do not have that recorded.)I forwarded the boss and his boss my application for a temporary resident permit reply from Canadian Consulate general saying it was processing.  I mentioned again I could not travel at this time.  The only other option is show up at the border with all the paperwork filled out and see if I can cross which often is allowed. I received a reply back from his boss saying keep doing what I’m doing.I’m not a loud or controversial person.  I keep quiet and work very hard, around 55 hours a week and help people in recovery.  I’m not trying to stir the pot at work.What do I do to protect myself, especially in a right to work state.  All email correspondences I save.  I have not recorded any conversations yet and I don’t know if they are admissible without two party consent their being recorded.  I’m trying to protect myself against backlash.(Keep in mind no one else has a passport and is being asked.  It’s his nature to bully people.)",0

In jail, they searched me - this included a female officer forcing me to take all clothes off despite me stating multiple times I do not consent to it, and squat while being naked. I was forced to wear jail uniform and spend one night there. All this has traumatized me.No charges were laid in the end, but it left me quite distressed.I wonder, ifThis experience will have any repercussions for my records etc?...I can do something legally against my exWas the search and arrest legal as I thought it could be only used against criminals?I can somehow pick up my belongings that are still at his house?",1

" (CA) What Exactly Does Marriage Change Legally/Financially? Hi, we’re a couple who have been together for 5 years, we’re two women in our mid-20s, located in San Ramon, CA. We both come from messed up families and don’t have guidance on this kind of thing, let alone where you’d go to get answers, and google hasn’t been much help, so here we are.So:What will marriage change for us, legally-speaking?How will our finances (filing taxes*, maintaining health insurance thru Covered California, responsibility of debts, anything else I might be missing) be effected?What information do we need to have ready/on hand to get married?Is there any way to find out both what debts AND what assets are in your name?Regarding debts in particular, can something like a pre-nup protect one person, in the event of divorce or the spouse’s death, from being assigned the spouse’s preexisting-prior-to-the-marriage-debt?*we have never filed taxes; our abusive parents claim us as dependents and we don’t make enough money to change thisI have a lot of medical debt and am TERRIFIED of her being saddled with it should something happen to me. Part of the reason we need to get married, too, is because I am undergoing yet another major surgery later this year, and I want to make sure in every way possible that my abusive parents don’t swoop in and make medical decisions for me and/or take anything I leave behind - I want everything positive & all control of my treatment/body/whatever if I can’t manage it for some reason to go to her & her alone.Thank you very much for any help you can provide us. We’re deeply embarrassed that we can’t figure this shit out on our own, so please try not to clown on us too much, haha.",1

I don't get why anyone would lend it.Let's say that some Wall Street trader wants to borrow $10 million in stocks from me and they pay a 10% fee for it. They sell it on the market, trash the company's reputation, drive the shares' value down to being worth $1 million, buy it back and give me my (comparatively worthless) stocks back plus a $1 million fee and pocket their profits.I gave them $10 million and got $2 million back.

"Child being bullied/cyberbullied and harassed. how to proceed? My child has been getting bullied at our public school for quite a few months now. I've talked about this to the school and brought it to both the administration's and teachers attention on multiple occasions. All in all it has been dismissed and the blame has been put on my child instead of addressing this with the other students. Recently over break and even on a day my child wasn't in school the harassment has become cyber bullying to a degree I cannot let my child have access to my phone (she doesn't have her own phone, so these kids have my number and text her seeming to forget she doesn't have her own phone). I've reported it to the schools public hot line but even today with her being absent they tried to harass her by calling and sending a slew of messages.Frankly I am done, and I have requested a meeting at the school about it as well, but I am wondering if there is any legal action I can take, and how I would take it? Cyberbullying is taken up with law enforcement here and considered very serious. My state acknowledges it as something that holds legal ramifications.",1

So, this week, the Biden administration put out their OSHA vaccine mandate, and was immediately sued by at least 11 states and dozens of private companies. Within 48 hours, there was a preliminary ruling given by a circuit court which I have seen various news sources refer to as a ""stay"" of the order and an ""injunction"".

Never put my name on any bills.Phoned them up, it was for a property I was renting in a joint agreement with someone else. Collectors asked if I wanted to cut the bill in half (nice gesture, would mean claiming ownership of the debt however), told them to put a pin in the entire thing while I figure out what and how all this came about.The energy provider account defaulted on September, 2 months after I departed the tenancy agreement, which was attached to a joint account in both my name and my roommates, which I terminated in July.Again, no idea it was in my name, amd tried to figure out why this is the first im hearing of this, and turns out all the contact details are for him (number and email are his, verifiably so, but its my name on the account).This looks, feels and smells like fraud, but I want to be certain if I reject the debt they have no legal backing to make it my fault and force me to pay.",1

" Blindsided by unexpected criticism I’m almost two years into a job that I love working for a boss I enjoyed. I have received only positive feedback from him, including interviewing and getting hired twice (first contract, then staff) and two annual reviews, the last with a merit increase. I’ve sensed a change very recently. At first I thought it was pressure from his boss to increase our productivity, but now unexpectedly my boss is directing his stress/frustration toward me. I tried to meet with him two weeks ago to discuss but he canceled at the last minute.I finally got him to meet with me last week as he was preparing to travel for a week. I said I wanted to understand why things had changed, and he became angry and accusatory, saying I was not being a “self-starter” and not moving projects forward. At least a dozen of these projects are waiting for his approval to start development. A few others I have been assigned are outside of my primary skill set and job description, but I’ve done my best with them. I explained that I had never received any guidance from him prioritizing projects while he stubbornly insisted we “talked about it all the time” when I knew he hadn’t - leaving me feeling gaslighted. He left me with a list of three projects to show progress on by the time he returns on Friday and I’m making progress on all three.I’m terrified he’s setting me up for termination for poor job performance, but until last week he had never indicated any issues. This change has been abrupt and very unsettling and I’m in a panic about how to proceed. How do I de-escalate this conflict and return to our previous “normal” with a good working relationship and positive feedback? I feel we need a neutral arbitrator to help reset expectations on both sides, but I’m afraid bringing this to HR will only inflame things further. I’m utterly lost about how to work toward resolving the conflict without making things worse and hastening my termination. How do I proceed?",0
" Employer forgot to sign me up for health insurance Hello!I started a new job in May of this year. This job had a 30 day probationary period. Once the probationary period ended, I'd be a full time employee with full benefits, including health insurance.However, at the end of these 30 days, I was never contacted about signing up for my benefits and I only recently realized the error. I never officially ""opted out"" nor did I make any enrollments...they just forgot about me. After talking to a fellow coworker, I was informed that if I opted out of my insurance, I would be afforded an additional $300/month. I reached out to HR last week about how I haven't had insurance for 6 months because no one in HR ever followed up with me. They responded that they would sign me up next month, but that since ""I had screwed up by not asking about health insurance"", they're not responsible for paying me six months of $300. Should I push to get the $1800 of back pay? Any other advice for me?Thanks!",0

" Can this be submitted as a case for receiving back pay on a salary increase? Myself, as well as some other employees (in a full-time rotational program) recently received a salary increase, but were told we would not be receiving back pay on it since a date had not been given for the raise. We were initially told about the increase in late June, but will not receive the increase until early November (we’ve been sent a screenshot of this in workday now). Here are messages found on Microsoft Teams from managers-Sent on August 2nd from someone 2 levels below the CEO- “I talked to (name) yesterday. (Name) continues to work with HR on the comp adjustments and potentially some changes to the program structure. HR has committed to resolving the comp issues by September. (Name) is pressing to get the comp issues resolved in August. Stay tuned.“Sent on August 24th by our direct manager- “Comp analysis and results should be done soon for the 2021 class.

" Is it me or my supervisor? I’ve been working for a new company in VA for about 4 months now. I absolutely love it, but I’ve been bumping heads with my supervisor recently for some reason. I accepted this role as a Senior Project Manager and was told during the interview process that it was everyone’s expectation that I would move into the Project Director role within a year. Growth is why I left my last company (absolutely loved it there, too, but no growth opportunities) so this role sounded perfect for me. Not to mention it’s fully remote!It’s a much smaller company so I also have weekly check-ins with our COO and CFO. They are both fantastic and I enjoy working with them. My supervisor was put into the Acting Project Director role for the time being, in addition to her other job as our Talent Director. She let me know up front she’d be learning from me and that’s great because I love a team mentality!However, in the past 30 days, something has shifted. For example, I came back a day earlier from PTO and Teams showed me as out of office still. I told her I’d fix it and less than 10 minutes later she called me and asked me why I hadn’t updated it yet. I told her I was quickly finishing up a task and would do it right after. She gave me a firm “do it now while we’re on the phone so I can make sure I can see the change.” I just brushed it off.Another example — I had to go into the office last week to meet with other team members and I turned my phone on silent for the 2 hour meeting. When I checked my phone during a break period, I had 7 messages from her asking where I was and if I was working today because Teams showed me as away all morning (I went straight into the office). When I reminded her I had the onsite meeting, she immediately back tracked and said she didn’t know I was going in for the meeting…. that she asked me to attend…. Now I’m beginning to think she has a trust issue.Another time she asked me to consolidate two spreadsheets into one, even though the team said sending separate was just fine. I let her know I had already cleared it with them and she said, “I expect that when I give you direction you’ll do it.” I was a little taken aback by that.There have been other comments she’s made, but in short I let her know on Friday afternoon that while I have a great amount of respect for her, I’m feeling a little micromanaged. All she said was “let’s get on the same page next week.”Am I in the wrong here? Our COO informed me last week he’s been getting great feedback from the team about me and he’s pleased with the progress I’ve been making. I’m feeling a little crazy. I pickup every call and respond to emails within the hour even when I’m on PTO most of the time. I worked at my last job remotely for four years under a female boss and she was so wonderful! How should I approach her next week without being disrespectful but also letting her know how I’m feeling?",0

" Staying in touch during long hiring process? Basically, I got fast-tracked through this interview process because the recruiter and program leads for a state advanced trainee program really liked me and I told them I had multiple job offers.

So, they sped me through three panel interviews with execs and said they'd have a final decision by Monday (yesterday). Well, the program starts in May and the final decisions typically go out in January, so the execs said they didnt feel comfortable giving a final decision because they usually don't until then and its too early but they liked me well enough. The recruiter apologized and I said I still would like to be considered (its a way better job than any of the others) and they said they'd definitely keep me in the candidate pool.

Its a long way until January and I dont want to be forgotten. Initially, I'd heard on glassdoor that the program started in January (doesnt say on gov website) so I didn't think fast tracking was that big of a deal but now I'm thinking I'll be forgotten if I dont do something to stay in touch.

" HELP! Sexual relationships, male favoritism, dismissed concerns!

I am not the store manager and this co-worker and I are on the same level. I have sent HR several documentation about this coworker concerning alarming behavior. My intuition and observations have been spot on.

He ended up doing the same behavior and the consequences were much more serve for the woman involved, the company, and himself.

Apologies, I'm new to reddit and am on mobile, but I have a question about what HR people are allowed to talk about.Several years ago when I was young, I worked at a bank.

They did end up firing me, but they were nice and the official reason was not blatantly that I had stolen. I have almost no doubt that they knew I stole, but they were saving face.
