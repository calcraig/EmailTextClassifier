ROI Question,"Lets say I am trying to create a promotion to attract more fans to a game. If I am discounting food and beverages to attract more fans (but still making a profit, just a lower total profit) should I include the loss in total profit as a cost for ROI? Or should the profit I am making off the increased attendance (1244 extra people) from the food be included as the amount gained?(Amount gained - amount spent)/ amount spent"
Calculating COGS and break even point for a manufacturing/service/retail company,"Hello, I am working on a case at University. The company is a manufacturer of printers. However they also purchase the consumables for the printer and sell them for a profit (retail style?) to the customers, and they do service (repair) for the sold printers.If it was just a manufacturer I know how to assign fixed and variable costs, calculate the contribution margin, then the break even point, etc. But I am lost with all these other factors.I hope this makes sense, and I hope someone can steer me into the right direction on how to approach the planning process for this assignment... I would be extremely grateful if someone can help me."
Financial Ratios: measuring performance,"Hello everyone,I've been calculating some financial ratios for AMD and Intel. Specifically I calculated Return on Capital (ROC), on Equity (ROE), on Assets(ROA) and Economic Value Added (EVA).I don't have the exact numbers right now but AMD returns we're almost 3 times bigger than Intel's, something like ROC of 50% vs 15%. Every return were noticeably better on AMD, but the EVA was like one fourth of Intel's.So which company would be performing better? Returns are like triple on AMD, but Intel's EVA is like 4 times the AMD's EVA. I have to comment on that for an assignment and I am a bit lost tbh.TIA!"

Trying to understand CTD bonds for interest rate futures,"I found this question with an interesting chart in the answers that describes conversion factors:https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/33199/when-a-particular-bond-is-delivered-why-there-is-the-need-to-define-a-conversioI can understand that conversion factors adjust what the long pays on delivery, but the short is delivering what they want buy buying it and that is not affected by the conversion factors?  So how is it an even trade?In the first chart in that example and assuming I am short, it looks like I can go into the market and with no yield shifts (x axis = 0) I can buy the 4% for around $90.  In the second chart the conversion factor makes it so that the long always pays around the same price which looks to be around $100 with no yield shift.  But doesn't the short get to buy at $90 still?I guess the assumption I'm making is that the conversion factor only affects the long.  And I get that from the CME here:"

Liquidity in the options market,One of the main justifications for options is that they can be used to hedge.  It seems like then you'd have a higher demand for puts on S&P or calls on oil...  These are things where a movement would negatively impact a lot more entities than who would be positively impacted.  Does this make it difficult to buy these options?  Or do you have to do so at a premium (not justified by the risk alone)?

Was the rise of 401(k)s a boost to the stock market? And has that boost evaporated?,"I'm not an economics or finance person.  This is mostly just a shower thought that I was unable to answer with a few minutes of googling so I figured I'd ask here:In my mind, for the first couple centuries or so of US stock markets, stocks were bought and sold by traditional investors (institutions and savvy and/or rich individuals).  I'll call that the Classical Era.The Early 401(k) Era seems like a sea change to me - starting in the late 70s and then really picking up in the early 80s, money poured into the stock market on behalf of a huge number of American workers.  With every payroll, institutions would buy, buy, buy on behalf of 401(k) holders.  Certainly there was some selling, but relatively little, especially early on as there hadn't been time for large 401(k) balances to accumulate.  Coincidentally(?), the stock market (from glancing at a chart or 2) appears to have performed better from 1980-date than over most time periods.Now it seems to me that perhaps we're hitting the 401(k) Equilibrium Era, where money continues to pour into the market on behalf of workers, but there are also now plenty of 401(k) retirees selling constantly as well.Is it reasonable to think that the Early 401(k) Era was a ""turbo boost"" for the market, but in the 401(k) Equilibrium Era we might expect future stock market returns to look more like in the Classical Era?"

How could Royals really be the richest people in the world?,"This isn't completely a finance question, but let me explain:I saw a video saying that the way we measure wealth at high levels is flawed, since we focus on shares of public companies. But rather, they say, the real wealth lies in people such as royals, who hold a large share of the wealth of an entire nation.However, I'm confused by this theory. In the United Kingdom, at least, properties like Buckingham Palace are not the property of the King(feels quite weird to say that) but rather the ""Crown Estate"". The way I understand it, this means that such properties as Buckingham Palace do not belong solely to the reigning Monarch, but to all the future Monarchs who will inherit these properties. Therefore, the Monarch cannot sell such estates, as that would rob all the future royal generations of their right to have these estates in the future.Wouldn't this mean that Kings and Queens do not own---at least in the same way---these Royal properties in the same way that Jeff Bezos owns a share of Amazon or Elon Musk owns a share of Tesla?"
"Shareholders own the company(corporation), right?","So, shareholders own stock in a corporation. Generally, corporations are run by a board of directors. That board of directors is elected by the shareholders. Often(sometimes through leverage within the board of directors), they are given a share of the profits.If the shareholders own voting rights to elect the leaders of a company, and they can(and are sometimes entitled to) a share of the profits of that company, in what way do they not own the company? I mean, I guess it's never outright said, but wouldn't those two things basically mean they own the company? If not, who does?"

Working Capital Accounting Questions - Profit and Cash,"I know to get cash from operations we essentially need to take our net profit, add back in changes in working capital alongside our depreciation expense. What I can't understand is how it works?Let's say last year I had £100,000 in trade receivables. This year I have a really good year, making a profit of £2m with £300,000 in trade receivables. I'd have to deduct £200,000, because of this profit, I'm still waiting to collect £200,000 of it. Is that correct?Similarly with stock, if my stock position went down this year, won't this be accounted for in my Cost of Goods Sold - I can understand why an increase in stock will lead to a cash outflow, because we would need to add back in unsold inventory we bought that year, but when stock goes down would this not be stock that has been sold and expressed in our COGS expense already. How does a decrease add to an inflow if a decrease would be it getting sold?Finally trade creditors (accounts payable), if this goes down then we end up with an outflow. Is this suggesting we've incurred greater cash expense than what's listed on the P/L because we've now had to pay down what we owed from the last accounting year, and what we owe this year is less? Say if we went from £10m to £6m in creditors, that would be a cash payment of £4m from last period to this period, and so as a result we would have to add £4m more onto our cash expenses as a result of paying - ""of the expenses listed on our P/L, we have incurred £4m more as a result of a reduction in our creditors as we've now had to put £4m more into our working capital cycle""?I'm trying to really understand the logic here. Is it essentially not classed as an expense because all it is is adding more cash to our working capital - more debtors, less creditors and more stock wouldn't necessarily get classed in P/L expenses as these costs are working capital - it's something we'll get back, as it's cash tied up in the business, but as they change they either use up more cash or generate more cash depending on how well we manage our working capital?"

From a layman's eyes it seems to be at a loss compared to the previous year, but financial news report it at a huge win.It is my impression that the net cash inflow from operating activities is the main thing to look at here and not the equity - as the company was bought by the company Tencent at the time and a dividend has been paid to the former owner and present shareholder of the company Chris Wilson, of ~100 million.What confuses me is the comparison of a 12 and 6 month periods. Is it a comparison of a fiscal year and a sample of another fiscal year, or an intermittent period - AKA do we need to divide everything by 2 for 2020 to compare the actual earnings?"

Can options contracts be priced less than $1?,"Since options contracts are for 100 shares each, is the lowest one can possibly be priced $1?Options are for 100 shares, but are priced per-share, and so premiums for puts or calls seem to be priced in penny increments. As a result, the lowest-priced option that I've seen is priced at $.01 per share, and hence $1 for the contract.Is this universally the case? Or is there anyone making markets (accessible by everyday people) that will price options in sub-penny prices per share, and so contracts sold for less than $1?I'm learning about options trading, and am exploring edge-cases that arise from how the markets for them work.

Returns of an interest rate swap,"I would like to calculate returns for a plain-vanilla (fixed-for-floating) interest rate swap. Consider, that I am long in USD 5-year swap rate, i.e. I'm holding a receiver swap for 5-year swap rate with notional of 100$. At initiation, the swap should be valued at 0$, as both the fixed leg and the floating leg of the swap should have the same value.If I valuate the receiver swap a month later and it would have a value of let's say 2$, then how should I calculate the return? Is it just (2$ - 0$) / 100$, i.e. change of swap value relative to the notional? I can't quite figure out how I could calculate the return by comparing change of value to previous value (or simply comparing consecutive values), as they can be at initiation 0$ and later be negative.If the correct way is indeed to calculate returns relative to notional, then why is this? After all, I am not investing any capital on the swap (apart from some possible margin payments), so why should I use the notional in return calculations? For me a more natural way would simply be following the value of the swap and calculating the returns with consecutive values, but then I face the problems of negative values and zero values mentioned above."
How does the calculation work for AER if the interest is paid monthly into the account?,"I feel like I'm being really sense, so I think I need some helpI recently started a savings account. It's got a variable interest rate, currently at 0.9% AER. The bank website says it ""illustrates what the interest rate would be if it was paid and compound once each year"". That bit (I think) I understand, it takes the balance once per year and adds 0.9% to it, right?My question comes from the fact that I chose to have the interest credited to my account monthly instead of annually. As far as I can tell, it'll still compound once per year, but I don't understand how the calculation would work. Will it assume the account balance at the end of the month is the balance it'll be at the end of the year and do ((x*0.9%)/12)? If so, won't that cause issues because I intend to add an amount to the account each month, so the next month will be a larger balance?I've tried looking online but I can't find an answerThanks in advance!"
Why is it generally difficult to take money out of a loan?,"I have a home loan on an investment property and am looking for a way to get a relatively small amount of cash conveniently.I would have thought it would be straightforward to ask my mortgage servicer to take ~5k of the loan back to my account, and they would benefit from more interest payments from my equity decreasing and the lifetime of the loan increasing.Instead it appears to be a massively complicated process involving a large number of calculations that would ultimately skyrocket my monthly payment.I have other ways to get the cash, but I'm curious as to why a mortgage servicer wouldn't offer this if both parties benefit."
We're likely to increase our incomes drastically. Where should all the cash go?,"Ages: Mid 20'sCurrent pre-tax household income: $200kRent: $1,500 / monthDebt: $130kCash: $150k401k: $30kProjected household income for the upcoming year: $400k (not sure about taxes yet)Assuming we max out our 401k's and IRA's ($50k pre-tax), where should all the other cash go in these volatile times? I think we'd have $350k cash 1 year from now if we don't invest."

Why is share buybacks painted as a bad thing in the media?,"So when I read a newspaper and it talks about share buybacks, it takes the view that it's greedy and a waste of money, something about pushing stock prices higher and thus triggering bonuses linked to share prices.But is it all negative? I thought, and I don't have a business / economics degree or anything, that shares are a way for for publicly listed companies to essentially borrow money without going to the bank to ask for a loan. The interest for what would be a loan is paid out as dividends instead to the shareholder. If that is the case, why wouldn't a company want to buy back it's shares? As bank loans expire when repaid, but shares last forever, then companies borrowing money by issuing shares seems like it's going to cost them more over the long term, forever. So why wouldn't companies when they have spare money buy back their shares and terminate in effect their loans?"
Does the Efficient Market Hypothesis limit one's rational to buying based on performance of a company?,"Or in other words, the CAPM model?Because there is more than enough proof to show GME's bullish sentiment being geared around provoking a squeeze rather than how the company performs.The best test to this hypothesis (GME's SI speculation) comes up in a few months where the company will begin paying dividends out.  Thus, if the rumor is true, every institution and or market maker who has borrowed and or created shares and these shares have been bought and held, they will be responsible for paying a dividend on a massive scale that could potentially force unpayable margin calls and liquidation of assets to meet the massive demand. If we see a sudden collapse in the market-maker speculated doing this, we'll see a bubble popping that will likely spread it's poison around the rest of the markets both domestically and internationally (just like 2008). Moreover, we will see raw proof behind EMH's short-coming where buying done was reflected on information not available, but speculated. Even though findings are getting closer and closer to the truth, there is still not a 1:1 finding that completely proves the speculation.The stock market should be about buying stock sold from a company, not around speculation and chasing a short-squeeze. To correct this, populating a SI real-time would be an efficient checks and balances however, if the hypothesis turns out to be true, it would likely take a complete overhaul of the markets and everyone complicit in allowing this to be a trusted function.  Until then, the bubble will grow.Reference:GME was short 140% January 2021 which has given raise to the alternative strategy in buying stock and equally making the company itself, independent from the given irrational model for return. If buying a company's stock isn't about returns from the company, but rather, returns from a short-squeeze from institution(s) and a market-maker abusing their reporting responsibility and authority short-selling, then that means the CAPM model becomes obsolete.  If the CAPM model services what EMH establishes, then I hope this all makes sense when I believe there is room to argue against EMH."

Why are most major European banks' valuations much lower than prior to the 2008 Crisis?,"14 years after the GFC, most major European banks (UBS, ING, Unicredit, Deutsche Bank, BNP, Credit Suisse, etc.) have stock prices which are a fraction of what they used to be prior to it.As a macroeconomist I cannot find a clear explanation. Growth has been fairly good in the past decade. I can understand Greece or Portugal's sovereign ratings being slashed, and that trickling down to companies, but that didn't happen in Switzerland or the Netherlands. Yet their bank's valuations are still comparatively very low.So why are valuations so low now? Any investor with a large portion of European financials must've lost a considerable amount of their portfolio."
Should I take a pay cut if I'm converted to a full-time employee from a contract position?,"Asking on behalf of my spouse.

I was wondering what's the best action for this? She cares about having that target range of 130k, but is concerned about what consequences might happen if she rejects it. We are thinking that they are lowballing this because she thinks the company wants to pay less and conversion to full time can do that"

Account that functions like a real estate trust account,"What type of account would suit this type of a business transaction: The transaction is similar to earnest money on a house in the way that there are three parties. The person who is paying, the person who is receiving the payment (according to the terms of the contract) and a third party who is facilitating the deal and who would establish the account. For this scenario it would need to be an account that money could only be removed from according to the terms of the contract, but ideally multiple transactions from multiple parties could go into the account. Does a trust account work like that? Can earnest money from multiple buyers on multiple houses go into a trust account or is there a separate account for each transaction? In essence, do you know an account where funds can be securely held by a third party until the contract is complete and that allows for multiple contracts and parties that is not for real estate?"

What happens to tariff payments to CBP?,"I worked for a company who imported several millions of dollars of electronic components per year, with a large portion from China.Late 2019 the US imposed a tariff on the import of goods from China, which the electronic components were included in, up to 30% at one point.

Now I know this wasn't the only commodity affected, nor were we the only or largest importer. So the amount of tariffs being paid must be substantial.My question is, what happens to this money?

Question about secured loans and double pledging collateral.,"If you had say, a really nice painting, a really large building or residential property, or piece of land, or portfolio with long term assets -Could you potentially used two credit accounts to pay each of them off month to month without collateral being seized? The idea would be that you would double pledge the collateral for two different loans for accounts that you paid off on a staggered basis with the other account. If you had millions of dollars worth of assets, and you just pledged them on an ongoing basis to two different accounts, taking advantage of the low interest rate and lack of down payment needed for a collateralized line of credit, could this go on indefinitely for something like consumption expenditures for some amount of years without any credit score depreciation or interest rate penalty as a result?My thought would also be that you could use it to purchase other assets and put your collateralized assets up on the market with a pretty high ask price and eventually sell it and then pledge the newly acquired assets and repeat the process.Or would you quickly accrue lots and lots of interest payments and have a shit credit score as a result?I’ve heard that some people with net worth in the billions do this in order to avoid selling their assets and incurring capital gains taxes, and I’m wondering how they’re able to maintain their credit scores and avoid getting collateral seized frequently. Because you can be delinquent and have your collateral seized, which was my initial thought, ie essentially selling your collateral to the bank, but I imagine you would get a penalty for that.How do they do it exactly?"
Who is the government paying with subsidized student loans?,"I just learned about subsidized vs unsubsidized student loans.

How to calculate Dollar Duration and Modified Duration with semiannual interest (without using Macaulay Duration),"So I'm having a dillema in calculating for DD and MD with semiannual interest rate.For example: i= 8% p.a compounded semiannuallyDifferentiate upon iP= 50/(1+0.5i) = 50/(1+0.04)So if we differentiate it to find DDDD= dP/di = [-50/(1+0.5i)2]*0.5 =  [-50/(1+0.04)2]*0.5Notice that I differentiate it upon i, not i/2Which means if we also do the second derivation for MD, we also need to multiply it by 1/2 again due to the derivating the second derivative.2.

Interest Only Repayment Student Loan - Question,"After graduating college, I didn’t have a high paying job yet enough to pay off my full student loans.

Is it not financially smart to do this?"

"Math question: still here because it has to do with finance. Idk read it, hopefully you have some insight","Hey guys so you know how people say that when you're younger you should make riskier investments? This makes logical sense right because compound interest. A risky 100x increase on your $200 NFT would give you $20,000 that if invested at 19 would grow to be pretty decent over time. Whereas that $200 wouldn't matter much even with compounding so the loss is less damaging in the long term. The point is that if you assume you invest a risky investments winnings in a compounding investment then the risky investment gets better returns when looking at it from the endgame perspective based off the time.So this got me thinking. Does that mean that there's a mathematically speaking, appropriate amount of income to gamble? Let's take American Roulette for example where odds are 47.37% chance of 2x and 52.63% chance of 0x. Those are obviously bad odds. But if we assume that 2x is invested in the S&P500 for 30 years after then that 2x actually increases. And all we have to do to make gambling in our favor is increase the expected outcome to be above 2.11x.Now maybe the opportunity cost doesn't quite add up. but let's add in the factor of increasing incomeAssume you have a month t for every month from t_0 to t_n. And your income can be expressed as a function of t.For ex. income at month t = f(t) = 5,000t/12 (you steadily increase income to make 5k more a month every year. Idk you're really on your grind in this thought experiment).So now there's two possible things for you to do with any amount of income each month.1). invest in index fund. Assume 7% APY compounding monthly2). bet on red in Vegas. Using odds above. Any winnings go to invest in index fund. ( or we could recursively repeat this process with winnings until we reach a minimum bet amount for the table or lose)"

Why is there an early withdrawal fee on 401K plans?,"I understand the need to pay Federal and State taxes on early 401k withdrawls, but the need for an additional 10% fee escapes me.

How do optimize taxes when selling mutual funds?,"BLUF: I want to sell some of my assets, which are mainly mutual funds, but I don't think I want to use a average cost basis. What do I need to consider moving forward?Basically I have mutual funds like most everybody else that I buy into a little bit here and there throughout the year. I have some in an IRA Roth and some in just a plain brokerage account (not IRA). My understanding is when I sell some funds from the brokerage account, tax is computed on the capital gains based on an average cost basis. That will include how much of the asset I'm selling and when those shares were purchased. I believe there's a drop off in taxes on capital gains if held for longer than a year, long-term capital gains. So what I would like to do is to sell some of the assets I bought over a year ago to reduce the capital gains tax I will pay.Example: I bought 10 shares of VTSAX January 2020. Then I bought another 10 shares in January of 2021. I believe vanguard allows you to change the cost basis from an average method to another method. Does that help, or make a difference, if you sell 10 shares out of the 20 share pot, or separate the pot into the two purchase events, and sell only the shares older than one year?2) For the Roth IRA, My understanding is that I could separate the money I contributed and the money earned from capital gains. I can do the separation in the account and sell only my contribution portion, which should not be taxed because they are not capital gains. Thus, The account would have in cash, all the money I can contributed, and all the money in capital gains would be held as stock or mutual funds inside the Roth IRA. Is there anything wrong with this thinking? The motivation is that in times of market instability, I can sell my Roth contributions to hold in cash in the Roth account to hedge my losses on the capital gains in the account if the market goes down. Note: I will not be taking any disbursement from the Roth account. Only moving the money from a mutual fund to a settlement account (money market) inside the Roth account."
What does owning equity mean? Understanding its meaning and usage.,"I just want to check my understanding of what people mean when they say have have equity.So equity financing is when you for example sell company shares for money. This financing is obtained by utilizing the equity we own and turning it into cash. Company shares are an asset that's usually called by equity, because: 1. It's value is not certain; or 2. It's value can decrease from the original; If the value of a share decreased, that could result in a loss to the buyer. Specifically the loss from first buying the share, and then selling it at a lower price.Or maybe the reason I presented is wrong. What truly characterizes an asset as equity is that there is some associated negative-value to it, maybe you call this a liability. An example of assets that have some associated truly negative cost would be: 1. The selling of a put option. 2. A house. You need to pay property taxes, if the house catches on fire you might have to pay to fix your and others' houses. 3. A dog, it needs food, you might need to pay a vet visit. 4. A ""loan"", since at the end it represents a net loss. \ According to this description a share wouldn't be equity would it? EvenAm I making a distinction where there isn't one?Also would a dog truly be called equity? Maybe if you buy it with the intent of resale. If you buy with no intention of selling it, is it wrong to call it equity? Is it more accurate to call it a liability?"

"If my student loan has no interest left on it, is it still worth paying off the principal early?","My wife has about $9000 left on her student loans. The interest rate was 7% and it says the remaining interest is about $20.

We're currently putting $550/month toward the loan. If we went ahead and paid it off, it would take about a year to build back up our savings.Also, is it really only $20 in interest remaining? They're suggesting we pay $200/month for almost 8 more years... would they really want to do that with no more interest?"

Why are banks assumed to buy or sell during OMOs?,"Hi.I'm reading about OMOs, and if I understand it correctly the way they are used to regulate the supply of money is that when the Fed sells (buys) Treasury bonds from the banks the banks will end up with less (more) money, and this will decrease (increase) the amount of money in the economy.What I don't understand about this is that this explanation seems to assume that banks will buy every Treasury bond the Fed wants to sell, and that the Fed will be able to buy as many T-bonds from them as it wants.Why would this be the case?"

I’m conflicted on what would ultimately be more helpful.,"I currently live in LA county CA and I have an opportunity to increase the minimum pay at my job to a living wage vs a minimum wage.  The thing that’s been bothering me is the overall impact that it might have on the economy. With the increase to wage though the plan I set up there’s a potential for an price inflation bubble that could potentially be catastrophic as a result. With the increase in pay comes an increase in spending, with an increase in spending comes an increase in price.

Hypothetical of co-owning a mortgage,"Hi Ask finance,Sorry if this isn't in the right subreddit, but figured more finance savvy people would be able to provide a better answer.My partner and I were having a hypothetical discussion and would like your input.Two parties A and B decide to buy a house together 50/50 split. So each party owns 50% of the house and also pay 50% of the mortgage each. This was always seen as an investment property for party A and party B gets to live in the house.I believe this isn't a fair contract because of the following reasons:Party A is paying for a house with no additional benefits where party B gets all the same benefits as party A but with the addition of a roof over their head making it already imbalanced.Total accommodation price is lower for party B as they don't need to rent another house or pay a 2nd mortgage like party A does.Both parties don't gain any income from renting out the house to a third party, so party A looses money there. Where as party B is neural as they benefit accommodation wise, but also equally loose out on no additional income from a renter.My partner believes that it is a fair contract for the following reasons:Because this was always seen as an investment property for party A, they never had the intention to live in it.Party A gets an investment property, regardless of who is living in the house. So in the long run, both parties will gain money once the house is sold down the track.Party A gets a foothold into property investing for less than paying 100% upfront (for a mortgage) due to sharing the cost (and might not have been able to afford the investment property themselves)."
Need some advice with Wells Fargo Debt,"Hey there folks, I got a Wells Fargo credit card early in college because my parents said I should build credit and they had the 0% interest introductory offer.Unfortunately after college I became addicted to opiates and had a very difficult time keeping my finances in order even though I’ve always worked full time.  After about five years the credit account with Wells Fargo had hit a 9,300$ limit and I was maxed out.  Wells Fargo also closed the account due to tardy payments.I have a good job now with decent pay, but these monthly payments are killing me because of the interest rate.  I can only afford the minimum and I know if I do that I’m basically just giving Wells Fargo heaps of money off of what I borrowed.I’ve looked into some options for getting out from under this, but do you guys have any advice for new avenues, ideas, or businesses to look at for help?I know I messed up and got myself in a bad spot, but it feels unfair for me to stuck in this cycle for the next several years just because I don’t make enough to pay off more than the minimum every month.

"Just turned 18 (F), have a few questions about finances.","I literally just turned 18 today as I'm writing this haha. I have a job and have been saving up money for college in a savings account- I'll be completely honest though and have very little clue about what I need to know once I move out eventually. I'll be living with my family for my senior year of high school, then plan to move into some apartments across from the college I plan on going to. My great uncle can give us (me and the 2 and possibly 3 friends who are hoping to move in together) a discount on the apartments. My guardian bought a car a year-ish ago that she plans to give to me once I move out.Alright, background aside, I have a few questions.I currently have a debit card and I think it might be a good idea to switch to a credit card to build up credit?Is it a good idea to create an emergency fund and start 401k? I know I quite literally just turned 18 so it might be 'too early'?Any advice for not stressing out about not really understanding how any of this works? I know of some people in real life who I can talk to and can likely teach me so I guess I shouldn't be too worried.Honestly anything you recommend financially since I'm an adult and plan on moving out for college in about a year?"

Missing cost basis for parent's investment,"My parents had a long-term advisor who they have been paying a percentage of assets under management for decades. Their returns were terrible and their fee was high. I offered to move their assets into my advisor's management and cover the fees now that they're retired and dad's in long-term care. In so doing, we found out that none of their assets came through with a cost basis. It even took ten weeks to get the assets transferred because the old advisor delayed. Now, we need to take disbursements from my parent's investments to pay for their medical care and we don't know what to sell because we have no cost basis. We are really upset with this advisor who is now blaming it on her assistant who didn't record the cost basis eight years ago when it was with a prior company. She's claiming it will take her a week to recreate the cost basis. Do we have a FINRA claim? Are we justified in being upset or should we have different expectations? Did this advisor's actions expose my parents to tax implications we need to investigate? What do we do next? Thanks for any help!"

Question,"Why is it not possible to have ""floating point or constant ratio"" leverage wherein if say one invests 10 dollars and borrows 90 dollars, if the stock price rises to 100 then the person will have 1,000 dollars worth of stock. But that person will now still only have 90 dollars borrowed whereas if they had a constant ratio of leverage the entire time, with automatically increasing loans to keep the 1:9 ratio constant, the person would have more like 90,000 dollars when the original stock price reached 100Let's say the price first reaches 20, then it can be sold for 200, 90 paid back, left with 110, then 990 is borrowed, position is now 1,100 instead of the original 200. Stock goes up to 40, 2,200 is sold, 990 paid back, left with 1,300, 11,170 is  borrowed, 14,470 is new position, stock goes up to 80, 28,960 is sold, 11,170 paid back 17,790 is left. 160,110 is borrowed. 177,900 is new position. Goes up to 100, 222,375, 160,110 is paid back, left with 62,265. The profit would get larger the smaller the sell-borrow-buy increments become, I think if you could keep the ratio as constant as possible you would get up to ~ 90,000 at the end but don't currently know all the mathematics.Is this an existing financial instrument? It would also work the other way around wherein a person's loans are automatically reduced if the stock price drops to keep the leverage ratio constant and prevent early bankruptcy (the usual pitfall of leveraging).The exact mathematics of this field are something obviously possible and I may work them out in the future."

Present Value of Annuity,"Hi everyone,Need some help understanding a basic finance question related to present value. I have the solution.. I'm just not quite seeing which reasoning is being applied to one part of the formula. Here's the question:Two dealers compete to sell you a new Hummer with a list price of $45,000. Dealer C offers to sell it for $40,000 cash. Dealer F offers “0-percent financing:” 48 monthly payments of $937.50 (48x937.50=45,000). You can finance purchase by withdrawals from a money market fund yielding 2% per year. Which deal is better?The solution is:Cash option PV = $40,000Financing option PV 2% = 937.50 * 1 / (1.021/12 - 1) * [1 - 1/ ((1.021/12)48)] = $43,228Answer: Cash option costs less.I recognize the PV formula being used for the financing option. I believe that formula is the t-period annuity formula.PV = C/r * [1 - (1 / (1+r)t ]I see C=937.50 and t = 48 periods. Can someone help me understand the reasoning behind r being equal to 1.021/12 - 1? I'm not seeing that step.  When I did the problem, I had r being equal to .02 /12."

Finance HW: Discounted Cash Flow Approach,"In your analyses you may assume:Corporate tax rate=25%;Pre-Tax Cost of Corporate Debt=3.5% (or assume some other level that you deem more appropriate) Equity Risk Premium=7.5%Risk-free Rate=2%DCF Model – Discounted Cash Flow ApproachEVj0 = FCF1/(1+WACC) + FCF2/(1+ WACC)2+......+ FCF5/(1+ WACC)5 + EV5/(1+ WACC)5, where EV5= FCF6/( WACC – gT), WACC is the company’s weighted average cost of capital, and gT is the terminal growth rate (typically between 2-5% per annum)FCF is the company’s unlevered cash flow that is available to pay out to investors. FCF values can often be obtained from Bloomberg or estimated using the company’s latest financial statements. Estimate FCF0 as discussed in class and then FCF1 = FCF0 x (1 + g1). Now forecast other future cash flows FCF2, FCF3, FCF4, ... using projected cash flow growth rates g2, g3, g4, ..., and insert into the discounted free cash flow model above.Once you have estimated the company’s EV, add cash and deduct liabilities to obtain your estimate of the intrinsic value of the Equity. Then divide by the number of outstanding shares to obtain an estimate of the firm’s stock price.Can someone please do this calculation and explain where you obtained the FCF0 value, WACC value, and projected cash flow growth rates for the company RIOT Blockchain, Ticker: $RIOT."

Stop loss in high quantities,"Let's say that a company, AAA, is worth $100 / share.Let's assume that the stock prices started going down. If most of the shareholders have a stop loss order placed at various points - $90, $85, $80 and so on, how would these orders go through if the price drops much faster than the orders placed?If all people selling at $90 would cause the price to drop down to $50, how would the rest of the shareholders with the next level of stop losses manage to get their orders through? Would they not be able to prevent their losses properly?From my understanding, the stop loss is a function usually offered by some financial services. I would appreciate if you could provide me with an explanation of how this function works in such an edge case as above. Thank you! :)"

Starting Business: What Do / Legal Requirements,"All I want is to do everything correctly legally speaking. I'm in Pennsylvania as I'm sure that's important. About 4 years ago I put $20 into Robinhood, got it to $40, pulled out $20. I was doing other things primarily and barely payed any mind to it.Fast forward to November of 2020. I have gotten up to $200 and I start to pay more attention. Noticed BTC fighting 20k hard. Dropped it all in MARA just before 10x jump over about a month. It was at this point I came up with the idea that if I hit a  $10k portfolio, I would be able make more than my expenses by well timed trades. (I was making more per week from an essentially free app then my Engineering job)In October 2020, I recognized a peak in MARA and a reversal in SNDL. I moved it all into that for a ride up another 5x till they approved the possible dilution of almost twice their shares in January. Sold all after that announcement. I quit my job in December.It was at this time GME had it's gamma squeeze to which I definitely bought a few at the top since I had some fresh cash to burn. After the crash I saw the reversal at $40 and went just about all in with a $9k investment there. Now it's sitting comfortably at $30k, which is higher than my $10k goal to make it my job."

Shorter or Longer Term Loans?,"Lets say I am a lender and I have 2 options of loans to give out,1 Month Loan @ 1% interest rate over the 1 monthand12 Month Loan at 12% interest rate over the 12 monthHow do I determine which loan to give? Assuming the borrower will accept any loan I give out.For example if a borrower wants to borrow $1000. I can offer them the 1 month loan and make, $10 in one month. Or I can offer them the 12 Month Loan, and receive $120. If we only evaluate it this way, then the 12 Month Loan is the answer.However, if I give the one month loan to the borrower, I get $1010 back in one month. And if I lend this $1010 out to borrower 2, after getting my money back in 1 month. I can charge 10% on $1010, and receive $1020.1 back at end of month 2.If I do this over and over again until the end of the 12 months. I would receive $126.83 in interest. Which is $6 more.So how do I compare these two options?The 1 Month loan has the risk, that if I can't find another borrower for month 2. Is there a way I can take into consideration this risk?"

Question on Imputed Tips,"My job is moving to putting digital tips on paychecks instead of pulling it daily from registers. They previously automatically imputed 50¢/hr. and wanted us to declare if we got more on the internal login site. With the upcoming change, the company says it won’t impute anything automatically and only what we declare. I’m a bit confused as how that works because on the paystubs “Imputed Tips” has always been on the income portion as an addition, not a subtraction or as a tax.Along with cash tips, tips are really minimal, 80¢-$1/hr., so nobody ever declared higher tips. If it’s a positive addition on the paystub, is anyone actually saving money by not declaring higher? Just confused on how it works."

Let's say for example, I want to build an ETF which tracks the S&P 500. How can I do so by using futures of the S&P 500 and what would be the advantages? Why not just make a portfolio with the underlying stocks and rebalance/reconstitute when necessary?Thank you very much!"
How do Car Title Transfers work,"I had a question on getting a car title transferred from my gfs dad to her. As some preface there are a lot of stupid decisions that were made before I got involved and I realize they were dumb. I'm just trying to look for the best way forward and to get more information because I know nothing about how any of this would work.My gf and her dad bought a car and took out a small loan to do so. The loan and title are in the dad's name. He explained to her that he would take out the loan for her because she wouldn't be able to. Instead, she would give him money and he would make the payments. This I know makes the car his by any legal definition.Now here comes the part I need help understanding. The loan is almost paid off and will be in about 3/4 months. Recently her dad has declared bankruptcy. What I don't know is that when the car is paid off, will he even be able to transfer the title to her or will that be listed as an asset for his bankruptcy and have to be liquidated?"

Corporation vs personal cash non registered account,Hello all! Apologies for the ignorance first off.So i’m in healthcare and my practice is incorporated.

Would it be more tax efficient to set up this account in my corporation or personally? Thank you for your insights
Exercising vs Selling to Close,"Everything online says, for call options, it's almost always better to sell the contract than to exercise it, then resale the shares. This is, among other things, because you're out the premium if you exercise then sell. However, is it not possible that the stock price can go up more than the option price, relatively speaking, so that the profit you get from exercising then selling actually exceeds the profit you would get from selling to close?Example: I buy a contract  for 1.00 with a strike price of 5.00. Then, the stock price goes up to 7.50 while the contract price goes up to 2.00. If I sell the contract, I  profit 1.00 per share. If I exercise it,  I profit 2.50 per share, less 1.00 for the contract price, so a net profit of 1.50 per share. I profit 0.50 more per share by exercising+selling shares than I do by selling the contract itself. How often does this happen?I'm having a hard time finding information online about how option prices tend to trend with stock prices. I don't know if anything like my above example actually ever happens, or if option prices always increase in proportion to stock prices. I know what ""delta"" tracks, and it's related to my question, but doesn't actually answer it.To clarify, I already know about other advantages in selling to close, like not actually having to buy the shares. I'm not talking about those things. I just want to know how often, if ever, the stock price increase is so much in excess over the option price that you make more money exercising than selling the contract."

First time buyer with a potential problem with Fidelity.,"So I'm never bought stock before, so I'm not 100% sure on how it works and can't find much about my problem online. I have bought 9 stocks of amc for about 126$. But I had put in $150 into fidelity to avoid coming up short before it bought the shares. But I noticed before it even purchased the shares that little by little it would just disappear, into 148 to 142, to 136 and so on. Now that it finally bought the shares like 6 hours later at 126 I'm now negative 7 in balance. Can someone explain this, are there hidden fees or something? Thank you"

What should people know about the current events regarding GameStop?,"I see a lot of memes but relatively little substance as per discussion about this topic.I am genuinely curious to learn more simply because I feel like a lot of the conversations online are being had between people who don’t fully understand the likely fallout of the events currently unfolding.For example, who is actually likely to benefit?  I’ve heard from my brother in law who worked as a hedge fund manager that it’s actually the super wealthy who will ultimately benefit from what’s going on.  But I can’t reconcile that with what I am seeing with my own eyes online.Are every day folks at risk of losing retirement or pension dollars?  I heard that said on NPR but virtually every person I chatted with online says that pensions and retirement funds can’t be invested on shorts and/or this will only hurt the super wealthy.  (Which flies in the face of what my BIL said— and he is generally 100% spot on and doesn’t say much without having a very high degree of certainty.)Just generally trying to cut through the noise and better understand the most likely outcomes of these events.  Not asking for a crystal ball just a no BS assessment from a status of now from someone who knows more about it then me."

What is the value of a stock in relation to the company?,"I don’t know a ton about finance or economics so I don’t know how to ask my questions in the most straight forward way. I may be asking the same question multiple ways or asking very different questions here so forgive me if some of this doesn’t make sense. I’m happy to try to clarify or discuss more if needed.Another way of phrasing my question might be What is the benefit of owning a stock other than being able to sell it to someone else? If I own a stock (or is it share?) of a company, can I do anything with it besides sell it to someone else at some point? Is there any inherent benefit in owning the stock itself?Why does an increase in profits for a company lead to people wanting to buy stock in that company? Is it just because the investment is seen as less risky because the company is less likely to go under? For example, if apple launches a new product lots of people will want to buy stock in Apple but they’re not going to actually see any of Apple’s profits so what makes Apple stock more valuable to them? I understand wanting to sell/not buy stock in a company who’s future is uncertain because off it shuts down no one will buy stock in a company that doesn’t exist. And I see where having lots of profit makes a company more likely to continue to exist in the future when you may still be holding a stock.Maybe it’s a more to do with the psychology of buyers. Is trading stock just about trying to predict what other people will want to buy rather than tied to any inherent value in the company itself?Thanks for any help! Hope this made sense. I tried googling for some answers but nothing I found actually got at these questions."

Best way to save for a house? (Roth IRA or Robinhood),"Hey guys, I was wondering what would be the best way to save money for a house. I don't plan on buying in the immediate future, so don't say cash. Should I open up a Roth IRA and start saving in there, and then use the 10,000 I can take without a penalty, or should I just keep saving and investing through my Robinhood stocks. I am mainly wondering about the tax implications. Are they the same? I thought the whole point of the Roth IRA was so that you didnt have to pay taxes on the growth, but I thought I read that if you take money out for a house, you are taxed on the growth, so if that is the case, how is it different then just regular stock trading. Any info of this would be greatly appreciated."
Why do funds/banks/corporations invest in tax credit opportunities when they end up spending more than they save?,"Why do corporations avoid paying tax? From my understanding, if a company profits $100, spending the $100 provides $100 in value rather than $79 in value if the same amount is taxed and then spent.Why do corporations invest in tax credits like low income housing or historic buildings??? The historic tax credit is 39% but the company still has to spend $100 to bring in $39 of credits which seems like a clear negative ROI. What am I missing?"

I sell off my 100 shares before I release my story, and again I save a lot of money.

Debt in Capital Structure,"Japan Red generates EBIT of 200 million.

Tax withholding on stocks per state,"Hi guys. So I have a question. I was granted stocks through my company in Florida (when I used to work in Florida), I’ve since then transferred to nyc. It was time to cash out my stocks but when I did, NYC city and state taxes were withheld from my earnings. I feel as if this was an error on my company’s behalf. Why am I paying nyc taxes on something that I earned in Florida?!? I asked the folks over at Fidelity and they too agreed that they didn’t think that was correct. When I reached out to my company about the issue, all they could tell me was pretty much that theyre right and I’m wrong with absolutely nothing in writing to prove otherwise. Folks at fidelity advised that I reach out to a financial advisor or accountant and I was hoping someone here can provide me with some answers and/or advice. Thank you"

Why Is Swedish Krona in the Dollar Index?,"I recently had a quick look into stuff about currencies, and was surprised to see that Swedish Krona is included in the Dollar Index at a weight of 4,2%, which is higher than Swiss franc (3,6%) and more than 1/3 of pound sterling's weight, even though the Swedish economy is less than 1/5 of UK's economy (plus I imagine both CHF and GBP are traded way more than SEK).So I'm wondering what is the reason behind this? I understand that since most European economies are using Euro now, there are fewer important currencies to pick from, but SEK is still a somewhat surprising currency in the index. Could it have something to do with Sweden being the ""leader"" economy of the Nordics (total GDP of Nordic countries is 50% of UK's GDP), or is it maybe that the behaviour of the Swedish economy or the SEK FX-market reflects the situation of USD very well for some reason (please elaborate)? Or is it maybe just a historical reason?Thanks!"

Early Payoff vs. Refinance,"Having difficulty determining what will be better overall cost saving strategy.  Goal is debt free in 5-7 years.

Balance is about 450K on an original 460K loan.  Rate is 3.875 fixed.I want to pay this thing off early and I have the cash flow to swing paying it off in 5-10 years.With that being said, does it make more financial sense to dump that profit from the sale of my last home into the current mortgage and make maximum early payments to complete the mortgage in 5-7 years or does it make more sense to refinance at a rate of 2.95 with still having plans to pay off sooner than the 10 year mortgage that would create (still goal of 5 years ish)?I understand there are a number of fees that come with refinancing and the hassle of having to do it all. I just don't know if the savings are going to be worth it, or if it makes more sense to just dump every extra dollar into the current mortgage and pay it off sooner.  The rate is less than 1 percent different after all.Incidentally I am already maximizing my 401K contributions yearly and have a 3 month emergency fund.

If so, do only the appreciation/gains of what I sell go into calculating income for whether I file taxes?All of the portfolio chunks I'm selling off are in a regular investment account as opposed to an IRA or ROTH IRA (which i'm leaving alone).Thanks!"

Mortgage company changed amount on check,"I mailed in my usual payment, however when looking at my bank statement I see that my mortgage company drew a line threw the amount I wrote and put in a different amount on my check.

I would have been happy sending a payment for a different amount if that is what they wanted, but to alter the original check doesn't seem right."

Concept of Marginal Investor in Cost of Equity from Damodaran's Lectures,"Hi guys, To understand cost of equity I ended up readingThis link : http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/littlebook/discountrates.htmfrom Damodaran's lectures. In this link he says that cost of equity that an equity investor demands from that stock. If there was only one equity investor, its easy to calculate that cost of equity. But with thousands of investors its tricky because every investor has a different risk aversion thus different cost of equity. So he introduces a notion of ""Marginal Investor"" who has majority stake and can actually influence the stock price. He says, to calculate cost of equity, we should consider risk from the point of view of this marginal investor assuming this marginal investor is well-diversified.I feel like I have barely understood this. Is it possible for someone to expand on this? Maybe also your take on cost of equity? ELI5 would be the best"
"How to construct a swap, interest rate caps and floors and options for hedging? [Fixed Income Securities, Masters Level]","I have the following situation about an investor.An investor has purchased a floating-rate security (non-callable) with a 5-year maturity. The coupon formula for the floater is 6-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points and the interest payments are made semi-annually. At the time of purchase, 6-month LIBOR was 7.5%.In order to purchase the floater the investor borrowed funds by issuing a 5-year note at par value with a fixed semi-annual coupon of 7.0%.Based on the above information, I wish to understand the following questions:-a) With respect to the above transaction, assuming that there is no credit or liquidity risk, under what interest rate scenario can the investor lose money?b) The investor feels that he will be able to offset the above risk using an interest rate swap. Is is possible? If yes, should he enter into a payer or receiver position?c) Can the investor use interest rate options to offset the above risk? If so, should he buy a semi-annually resetting cap or a semi-annually resetting floor? What should the minimum or maximum strike price be in such a case?d) Suppose that the investor enters into a 5-year interest rate swap in which the investor pays LIBOR. The swap rate is 7.3% and the frequency of the payments is semi-annual. Will the investor gain or lose due to this transaction? Determine the net annual cash flow for the investor?e) What is the nature of the counterparty risk associated with the floater and the interest rate swap? Describe one way to hedge or mitigate such a risk in each case?"

Understanding parent companies/shareholder companies and insolvency?,"So Im trying to help a friend understand their situation at their place of employment but Im not sure I understand things correctly. This is in the UK/Europe but I assume its similair rules worldwide.My friend works for a UK based company, which also has ""sister"" companies in europe and one or two further afield.As I understand it the shares are 100% owned privately by a holding company with a CEO in Europe. But the parent company is a seperate larger investment company in Europe.For ease of reading call the businesses BBB UK, BBB Denmark, BBB New Zealand, BBB France. The holding company that owns 100% of shares in the above 4 is BBB Holding AG. The parent company of the above 4 is QWER based in Europe.BBB Holding AG is going into insolvency (going to bankruptcy soon I assume) what would this likely mean for BBB UK?

Which order is better to May off loans in? A small one with no interest or a large one for interest?,"For context, I’m referring to a mortgage at $150000 with 3% APR (30 year) and a $6000 loan (5 year) with no interest for furnishing. Typically, I overpaid the mortgage with $100-$200 dollars each month. A minimum of $100 of that is going towards the furnishing loan. That leave about $100 per a month I could use for either of the loans. Which would be a better choice?  Also, is there a formula I could use to help calculate this?Thank you."

"Why would high Fed funds rate ""draw money away from Treasuries""","Investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp#what-is-a-treasury-billIt says ""A rising federal funds rate tends to draw money away from Treasuries and into higher-yielding investments. Since the T-bill rate is fixed, investors tend to sell T-bills when the Fed is hiking rates because the T-bill rates are less attractive. Conversely, if the Fed is cutting interest rates, money flows into existing T-bills driving up prices as investors buy up the higher-yielding T-bills.""If I understand correctly, any bank can be the recipient of fed funds rates. So when fed fund rates are high, the banks have very little money and vice versa. It says that T bills go down when fed fund rates are high. If a bank needs money while fed fund rates are high, it is gonna raise the interest rates of the bonds it offers to raise funding. Is this why T bills go down? It becomes more attractive to buy bank bonds rather than treasury bonds?And when fed funds are low, bank bond rates are low so treasury bond rates are relatively high?Also: does the money market include both treasury bond opportunities and bank/corporate bond opportunities?"

"Remote working and taxes - why would a business not ""relocate"" to a low tax state? What about an employee?","The lockdown has forced many companies to go fully remote, or at least open up to it. So I'm wondering how a few scenarios would work:Consider a high tax state like NY. Originally, company had a physical presence. All employees lived in that state, going to office. Everyone pays NY state taxes, both personal income and corporate. By 2021, company realizes they can function 100% remote. It doesn't make sense to pay for an office lease anymore.So suppose I want to move to Wyoming or Nevada, a state without income taxes, and purchase 10 acres of land for the cost of a studio in Manhattan. How would my taxes work? Do you pay taxes to the where your work was done? Or do you pay taxes to the state your work was done in, but then get a refund for minus the difference in your local states taxes? In this case, how is where my work is done defined, because it is fully remote - or consider this possibility:Suppose the company ""relocates"" to Wyoming or Nevada. Remember, no more physical office. This is a purely digital company with employees scattered all over. Again, how would taxes work? How does official relocation work in this case? It surely can't be tied to the residential address of your CEO, because consider a 2019 scenario where a business hires a remote CEO."

Is this a viable way to avoid interest?,"So, I bought a laptop last year through Very, using a 'buy now pay 12-months later' scheme. I have £300 left to pay in the next two months before interest is added because the 12-month period has ended. Unfortunately, due to COVID, I've been unemployed and can't afford to make that payment.So, I've had an idea, please tell me if it's stupid, please. I know I'll be in a better position in the next six months but want to avoid interest. So, I was thinking, would buying another product (valued around £300) using the 'Buy now, pay 12-months later', then selling that product for cash to cover the original item I bought, thus avoiding the interest, be a good solution?Leaving me with the same amount to pay back but with more time to pay it back. Does this make sense? Just to add, should I not make the payment, the interest is £200. Also, I'm not looking to eraze the debt, just off-set the payment dates."

"Mortgage, HELOC or Personal loan","Hi all,I have 23k in credit card debt with a super high interest rate. I am trying to figure out a way to pay this off with a lower interest rate so that it is manageable. Here are my options:I am in the process of renegotiating my mortgage. If I add the 23k debt payment, they are going to increase my interest rate from 3.99% to 4.3%, which would increase my mortgage payment by almost $250 a month, so over the course of my mortgage at 30 yrs, that seems like a lot!Apply for a HELOC to pay it off. The interest rate is lowest with this option but I don’t know if a variable rate is a good idea and I don’t like the idea of basically taking out a second mortgage.Apply for a personal loan. The interest rate is like 11% though, but we would have it paid off in 10 years with a monthly payment of $316.Which option sounds best? Any advice would be much appreciated!Thank you :)"

Futures Contracts: Am I An Idiot?,"Ok, I have a dumb question.So I'm looking at this website at the price of gold futures. The market price for these futures says 1723.

I assume not, because when the contract expires that would mean I have the obligation to pay another $172,300ish to buy the physical gold.OR: If one contract only costs $1723, and I buy it, come expiration day does this mean I would have to pay whatever the spot price is for 100oz of gold? Or would I have to pay 100x the price of whatever the market price of the contract is at expiration? Or would they go back and look at what I originally bought it for, and I'd have the obligation to buy the gold at 100x the price of $1723?Holy fuck I'm so confused."

Is it worth it to buy a new car or buy the one my sister is selling me?,"So, I'm looking into getting my first car. Some background: 18, F (not that it matters🤷‍♀️), living with roommates, steady full-time job. My sister is selling her car, but 1) she hasn't been able to actually give me (rather my mom because apparently she cant just communicate with me abt this) a set price, it was 3k, then 2k, and now 3.6k, and 2) she, in the first place, is only selling it because she wants to buy a pretty new car for a road trip coast to coast.The car itself is I want to say 2-3 years old, she's still paying it off, but one of the big turn-offs for me is that it has no ABS (therefore no cruise control). I travel a lot for band, and possibly in the coming future as a military wife. Having comfort features like cruise control are very important to me because who wants to be driving 5 hours one-way every other weekend in an uncomfortable car?I've found so many cars online that have way more than I could ask for, where I'd only have to pay a high-200 monthly if I put down the price my sister is asking me for. Would it be more worth it to go for one of those (especially since i have no other monthly fees other than rent) rather than the car my sister is trying to sell? I know it sounds kind of bougie, but she's also practically begging to have me buy it off her because she cant find anyone else that would want to buy it.TL;DR: old car from my sister for $3600 that lacks comfort for long trips, or new car for 3600 dp + ~275 monthly that I would love?"

I did spend about 5k fixing some of the larger problems in the house. But I don't want to do this forever. I have taken a blow to my pride and ambitions by having to file, and I just want to live securely and not worry about things like medicine/bills and food. Is it even possible? Thanks."
How do I do this last part of this finance problem?,"d. Write down the equation for the IRR of this project. (Don’t solve for the IRR, just write the equation whose solution is the IRR)A project that has an investment cost of 3,000,000, to be paid today (t = 0), and will generate a cash-flow of 400,000 in the first year (t = 1). The cash-flow will then grow at 15% per year for the next ten years (the last time the cash-flow grows at 15% is from t = 10 to t = 11). Afterwards, as competition increases, cash-flow growth is expected to be only 3% per year in perpetuity. (The cash-flow grows at 3% from t = 11 to t = 12 and forever thereafter.) The discount rate is 22%."
Corporate Finance: Credit and Inventory Management,"Senior Year in College. Taking Advanced Corporate Finance and reading chapter of credit policy (the aspects of extending credit to business customers). It's a weird topic (or at least it's explained poorly by the textbook), but essentially, here's a scenario that describes my confusion: A company makes an order for $1000 and is granted credit by the seller with terms 2/10 net 30. The book says that the effective credit period is 20 days (since the 10-day discount period is basically ""free credit), and the cost to the buyer of not taking advantage of the discount is equal to $20/$980 ($980 in the denominator because the book explains that the credit is essentially a loan for $980 and the interest is basically the foregone discount of $20--it's a weird way of thinking since it's kind of altering reality, but im going along with it).Now, the confusion lies in calculating the ANNUAL cost to the buyer of foregoing the discount. The book says that there are 365/20=18.25 such periods (referring to the credit period and effectively assuming a repetitive buying process throughout the year), so we have to compound the per-period interest rate of 20/980 to arrive at the effective annual rate of [(1+(20/980))18.25] - 1 = 44.59%.Now, I understand compounding and effective rates when it refers to compounding interest rates on an investment (for example, invest $1000 and get 2% a month with monthly compounding...what is the effective annual rate? bla bla bla), but why are we compounding the per period rate in this case (meaning, in the case of missing out on a monthly credit discount?). Because... in my thoughts, the book is assuming that there are 18.25 order during the year of (based on the ""loan story""...) $980 and we pay $20 of interest each time. So isnt the effective annual rate just ($20 x 18.25)/($980 x 18.25), which is just equal to the per-period rate (=$20/$980)?"
What happens after a gov bailout to the industry?,"Do the stocks return to their original price?As I understand it, the trump bailouts will likely be an extremely low interest rate. The businesses will stay afloat for 2 years with the money, and then demand will raise to what it originally was, or begin to.Does the stock price go back up? Or is the new stock price what it is really worth since now the company has a pile of debt, i.e. the stock is worth less.

Student loan debt overwhelming - any other options?,"Throwaway cause this is embarrassing.I currently have about $175k in student loan debt. Some from undergrad and most from grad school. Grad school took a little longer than expected - had two kids and parents passed away, wife couldn't work, couldn't afford insurance. All of these things led to needing loans and racking up credit card debt. Weren't spending money on tons of extras, kept one car, but school was in a very expensive city so cost of living killed us. FF to now: both of us have full time jobs, combined gross income of about $110k/year in a good year. Due to paying loans and revolving debt we're just sinking lower.  Again not living outside means at all but when most of your salary goes into paying debt we just end up accruing more. CC debt is now around $35k.

An acquirer could buy stock of the target to “soften” them and help the takeover, but presumably wouldn’t that raise prices.

How do you compare IRRs for 2 different compensation rates?,"Hello, I work in the solar industry and am having a little trouble wrapping my head around how to compare IRRs with different utility rate scenarios.Example: Customer has a rate of 5¢ per kWh. If they use solar, they would get that 5¢ credit per each kWh produced and pay for each kWh they buy from the grid. If the customer switched to a higher rate of 10¢ per kWh, they would be credited 10¢ per kWh produced and charged 10¢ per kWh they buy. Essentially for this switch to make sense, they would have to have enough solar to make the difference of the higher rate worth it.Now comes the IRR question. When I model the 5¢ rate option, the IRR is 6.3%. When I model the 10¢ option, I get a 13.5% IRR (rough numbers here). How do I compare these to understand which is truly the better option?Thanks for your help!"

Inheriting $ from a defined benefit annuity/pension?,"Hey guys,I never post and I don’t know much about finance so be easy on me. Around 4 years ago my grandmother passed, leaving myself and 4 siblings with 18% each and her son (my weird uncle) with 10% of the money from this so-called “retirement fund.” Shortly after, each month, a check is direct-deposited into my checking account of a fixed dollar amount. I was initially under the impression this would only last 5 years. However, after inquiring more about the plan through the insurance agency this past month, they are telling me I will receive these payments for life. My brother called separately and they also confirmed that with him.After asking more questions, they began getting aggressive, asking for my dead grandmothers social security number and requiring a death certificate (which, shouldn’t that have already been handled being that I’m receiving payments from her plan, thus implying her death was already legally confirmed ?)When I called her former employer (the owner of the plan) the hr rep explained it was an older type of a defined benefit annuity plan offered prior to 2001, but because my grandmother had started working their in the late 80s, she was grandfathered into that plan for the rest of her tenure. However, the HR rep was under the impression that the payouts lasted only 10 years and that only the company contributed to this plan.Now I’m confused once again.Also, I’ll throw in more info so maybe it’s more helpful.I treat this money as income and pay taxes on it annually. I just received this years 1099-R.Basically, what kind of plan am I dealing with? If it is a life long payment, do I have the option for a lump sum payout after withholding taxes? Frankly, the amount of money I’m receiving monthly isn’t substantial enough to make any dramatic changes (paying off student loan debt, down payment on a condo), but, if I truly am receiving this value for the rest of my life, it’s worth over 100,000 dollars if I live to be average age.At this point I’m speaking gibberish. I’m a biologist so please don’t rip me for being so clueless on the topic.Thanks for any help!"

Net Working Capital - Valuation Question,"Hi all -




I was wondering about NWC's impact on company valuation. I'm at a more accounting-based internship right now, and learned that when firms bid on a company, they submit a letter of intent that includes a NWC ""peg"". On close, the seller owes the buyer any decrease in NWC from this ""peg"" (conversely, the buyer would owe the seller any increase in NWC from the ""peg"").




This means inherently that the valuation of a company within the period from LOI to close goes up with an increase in NWC. However, basic finance dictates that an increase in NWC reduces free cash flow and causes the valuation to go down.




Why is there the opposite effect on valuation from LOI - Close and pre-LOI, and if not, why?"

Flex Healthcare account for childcare?,"Hi all,




I've always had the ability to put money into flex healthcare since I've been at my job. I've recently changed jobs and the benefits actually explained a bit better that I can use the flex healthcare card for child daycare. This is great because its pretax income applied to the card! I currently pay $264/week for childcare.




Due to financial situations, I can only put $2,500 into the flex healthcare card for my child (wife and I file separately). I currently make $130,000.

Is this a savings at all? Or is it more headache than worth? I know I'll have to manage moving from the flex card to my CC when I max it out after a few months...

I have about $8k in 401k and $30k in student loans. Should I rollover 401k of previous job to self-directed IRA without getting hit with tax or take the hit and put the money on students loans?
analytical correct efficient price of an option under simplified hypothetical conditions,"I'd like you to help me work through my thinking, with easy, big, round, numbers and perfect information.

We will have a pharmaceutical company that has all its eggs in one basket, and a single stochastic event.

The event is that in 365 days a study result will be in, and either the company is worthless (worth $0) or worth $100 billion. (just accept this stochastic condition please.)

For ease of computation, let's say that due to the efficient market the current trading price is $50 billion, since it perfectly factors in the single stochastic event - i.e. due to 50% chance of being worth $0 and 50% chance of being worth $100 billion, it is therefore worth $50 billion.

Now.

How much should a call option for 1 year (and a few days) at a strike price of $75 billion be worth?

My thinking is that there is a 50% chance that it is in the money a 50% chance that it is worth 0%.

I think I have given you all of the perfect information to calculate what the trading price of the option should be today, under the simplified probabilities I mentioned, and perfect market conditions.

What is the price of the option today under a perfect market system? Can you help perform the analysis?

Thank you."
Semi complex question about tax returns,"So in 2017 my federal return was garnished over student loans I refused to pay. Early this week I received a letter from the department of education stating that my loans had been forgiven. So my question is... is there a way for me to recover 2017’s return?

Any help will be greatly appreciated!"
Did I pick the absolute worst time to buy a house?,"I bought my house in July of 2017 and it seems like every year, as I do my taxes, I just get dumped on. Obama tax credits, Trump tax credits, homestead, write offs... I had to pay on my taxes for the first time in my lifetime last year, almost $3500. Now, people keep telling me ""well Obama era credits are expired"" and ""well Trump's plan consolidated all the write offs into a higher standard"".

All the news I hear seems to tell me that I couldn't have picked any worse a time to buy a home (something i've been told my entire life is the ultimate goal of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness).

Someone tell me I'm wrong. Someone tell me this will, somehow, help me. Someone prevent me from wanting to burn this shit to the ground as the worst investment i've ever made. This shit infuriates me and I am so lost, with no one giving me a straight answer."
