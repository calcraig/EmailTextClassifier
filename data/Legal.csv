Can I safely use this exploit I found?,"Hey all, funny question here. Sorry if this doesn’t fit here. Just let me know.So there a local event near me around Christmas time that is quite expensive. When in checkout, I had the sudden urge to try a random coupon code which to my amazement ended in a 100% discount. There’s no way this is illegal right?A bundle of tickets is under $100. However a nice package for the event easily runs over $500 for a night.Now, morally, this may be wrong, although we’re talking a large corporation holding a local event. Of course I’m not here for a moral compass. However, I ask of you, is this legal? Can I be charged with anything for this? Can I be kicked out of the event for exploiting this even?"

US-Specific: Is a stamped visa required to re-enter the US from Puerto Rico?,"I have been in the US since 2009, and I have an H1-B visa, which was renewed in February this year. Due to the long wait times at US embassies in India (my home country), I have been unable to get the stamping done in my passport.I have a few weeks of PTO remaining and was considering going to Puerto Rico for a vacation, but am concerned given that while I have I-797, I don’t have a visa stamped in my passport. So I really have two questions:Do I need to get some special permit to visit PR?Will I be able to re-enter the US?Thanks in advance."
Can you print and sell a piece of the US legal code?,"That's pretty much it... If I'm in the US, a citizen, can I publish any part of the US code? https://uscode.house.gov/ like straight up from the government. Put a pretty cover on it.I couldn't find anything about it so i assume its an uncommon thought lol"
Could I have a case against a vet?,I live in Virginia but drove 2 hrs round-trip sometimes 3 for traffic to an ophthalmologist who could see my yorkie for his cataracts. I was given a paper that said he'd be on antibiotics before surgery and other meds months before surgery. I postponed and notified the vet that he had cushings disease and was going thru testing so we postponed surgery until last June 2022. I paid 6400 for the surgery. She said he had no detached retina and was cleared for surgery so he had surgery and no antibiotics given before surgery. He got an eye infection and couldn't see after surgery. He was then given antibiotics after I drive back to have him seen in Maryland. Since then he has been on eye drops with barely any improvement. She then said in his last visit that he had a detached retina in one eye and some sight in the other. Probably due to his cusbings. Now why wasn't I informed of that before? He also had high BP she said was due to the cushings that causes the building behind his eye causing the detached retina. I feel now I should have just put him down but I love this now 13 yr old dog and if I'd know the cushings caused blindness then I wouldn't have gone ahead with surgery. What are any chances I have to take any legal action for possible negligence? It's Maryland and it says I'm not allowed to record anything without consent.

Meeting PHI/PII Regulations,"Hey all, I'm a dev for a small  startup. Part of the software I'm developing may gather PII or PHI. I'm  needing to implement solutions for meeting regulations when data is at  rest and in use. The problem I'm discovering is that I do NOT understand  the law or other regulations for how to meet this requirement. For  example, after reading some of the FCR (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-164/subpart-C/section-164.306) I can fully say I do not understand the requirements for encryption of data.How can I make sure I am hitting all of these regulations without  incurring penalty to my organization and allowing a data breach?"
Landlord overcharging for Utilities (WA STATE),"Hello all, My landlord charges his property for utilities based on persons occupying each unit, or distributes cost based upon occupant. Those units with more tenants get charged greater than those with fewer. I've lived here for nearly 1 year, and just noticed my landlord is charging me for 2 tenants. This is an extremely small studio apartment and is not in great condition (i.e., mold on bathroom ceiling that is wood with defective fan, etc.) I am the only person on my lease. I live in Washington State in Kirkland. What should I do? I sent an email detailing the discrepancies and asking for reimbursement. I'm very frustrated and I move out of this place in 1 month."
[US] What kind of lawyer do I need to deal with a 20+ year old military conviction?,"I want to get some more information about my conviction and see if anything can be done to either expunge or seal it, or failing that, to minimize my conviction's impact on getting a security clearance.  I'd also like to see if I can get my firearms rights restored as well as getting a better understanding of how my conviction could impact my opportunities for emigrating to certain countries.What kind of lawyer do I need?  I'm in the DC area, so I have a lot of law firms around, but I don't know what key words to look for.  Or are my questions broad enough that I'd need more than one type of specialization?If it's relevant, it was a general court martial and I was sentenced to 12 months incarceration and a bad conduct discharge."
Creating a contract?,"This is my first time posting on reddit, so if I am doing this wrong let me know. I feel the need to make a contract but I'm not sure how to put it to make it legally binding to where the agreement I have with these people doesn't change when it is too late. I have been temporarily staying with my mother in law and her friend offered to fix my vehicle and pay for the parts free of charge. Over the past few weeks waiting on the parts to come, everyone involved has told me repetitively (no matter how much i ask) that i will not have to pay them back for the parts or services because they say they genuinely want to just help in this time of need. * My worry is when my vehicle gets fixed tomorrow i don't want them to go back on their word saying i have to pay them and possibly making it significantly more difficult for me to move out with my vehicle in the next few days. *I have searched youtube and google for more specific answers but no luck.In conclusion I just need to know how i would word this contract and what to include to make it valid if need be. I appreciate any help thank you"

"[USA] Can information obtained by a foreign legal system be given to, then used to convict a person in the U.S.?","Hard to condense that into an easy title. But essentially, if a foreign government uses methods not normally allowed by the U.S. legal system, to obtain a confession or other information, can that information be turned over to the U.S. and then used against that person? Let's say that John Doe was arrested by the Qurac police for simple assault and while in custody, without a lawyer, without any kind of Miranda-style warning, or any of the other normal protections we enjoy over here, John Doe confesses to a crime that occurred in the U.S. The Qurac government then sends that confession to the appropriate authorities in the U.S. Is that confession legally admissible in the U.S. court to convict them? Assume the methods used were legal under Qurac law and were not necessarily extraordinary under U.S. law (i.e. torture wasn't used, but some coercion was). For context, a friend is trying to write a political thriller (just for fun, don't expect to see it on bookshelves), and thinks that this is a way of ""dodging"" the fourth and fifth amendments. I don't, and certainly hope in real life that it's not, but I'm not a lawyer. Thank you!"
[USA] what happens if Plaintiff Witness does not cooperate with Defense subpoena?,Curious if anyone's seen this situation before. I'm facing a bogus criminal misdemeanor charge with two known Karen-type persons listed as witnesses. I know for a fact these people coordinated and planned to 'catch me' doing a trumped up charge.We are pushing for full jury trial and have issued subpoenas for all email/text/phone records between these two witnesses. ... but I suspect they may challenge or refuse to hand over their phones/computers for forensics and/or drop out of being a witness.What happens here? Would the State make moves to bring contempt charges against their own witness for not cooperating with the Defense subpoena? Has anyone seen a situation like this? I haven't been able to find much discussion about a situation like this.
[Massachusetts] My company has asked me to sign a waiver that I can be voice-recorded. Does this mean that I can use voice-recorded data in case I have to sue them?,"Here's my contract with them.It states: ""I hereby grant the undersigned company permission to photograph, video and/or audio record me."" So if they can photograph and record me, does this mean that I can do the same against them in case I have to share it as evidence in case I have to sue them?"
Florida: can à parent install a tracker on their childs phone if their kid is 20 years old?,"Basically my friends parents are overcontrolling to say the least. And now she's telling her that they are putting a tracker on her. She is 20 years old so an adult in college, but lives off campus with her parents. I was wondering if that was even legal, and what steps she should take because the parental control is getting à bit obsessive"
Oregon sent home from work,I told my boss I had a migraine and the sent me home and cut m shift the next day claiming that this is a symptom of COVID.

W-9 and W-4 normal for a settlement?,"I have a settlement and my lawyers are saying I need to fill out a W9 and a W4. The W4 sounds accurate because the other lawyer and mediator mentioned part of the settlement is coming as ""employment income and taxable"" but I don't know what the W9 is for as it looks to be for a business or something.Is this a normal thing for settlements?

After my last injury I suffered another injury. My workplace is denying me to WFH or utilize medical leave despite my injuries being worse. This is after a long period of harassment targeted at myself. I contacted my employer’s personnel department and they ignored me.,"Missouri: Long story short, my ankle was sprained a few weeks ago. They initially thought it was broken, but apparently just a really bad sprain. Since we’re on our feet a lot at work, the doctor said I should WFH in the meantime until I’d improved enough with physical therapy. I was on a crutch, with a boot. I could move around, but only with difficulty and it was impractical for me to be in the office since we are expected to constantly get up and move around to help customers and clients.My work initially denied this, and made me miss several days continually moving the goalposts as to what paperwork was “required” to make this happen. Other employees are not subject to this kind of treatment, which I’ll describe further in a bit. Finally they agreed to it. Shortly thereafter, I was attacked by a dog, which greatly damaged my right hand and also sprained my right foot (it was kicked into a solid wall as I tried to extricate myself). The doctor said that I should again WFH since now I was in an even worse situation physically, now with boot moved to opposite foot, ankle brace on the other one and a busted right wrist that makes it painful to type and write, even with a wrist brace, and provided a note that I had them fax to my employer.My employer responded that they were simply denying it this time. I had to be in on Monday, even disregarding the fact that I have yet another appointment that day for further treatment of my wrist.I can name off several employees in my office who I have personally witnessed not being subjected to this treatment for similar injuries such as lower-extremity sprains, but my workplace has consistently harassed me for over a year. I have been screamed at and threatened in full view of the public; I have been forced to sit in my boss’s office repeatedly being accused of lying (I WASN’T), then had that boss call my other boss and demand I go to his office after she told him I refused to admit I was lying about breaking policy (I WAS NOT LYING), an interrogation that left me literally in tears as they berated me in his office for almost half an hour; I have had paperwork ripped out of my hands; been subjected to sexual harassment twice - the first time, my boss dismissed it as “not real” (they sent me multiple damn notes in the mail) but said that I didn’t have to talk to this person if I didn’t wish to do so, and within days my other boss transferred this person to my phone specifically, and the second time I was apparently supposed to take it as a compliment; I have had my chair and desk blocked off by my boss as she first insisted that whatever I was doing “wasn’t work and was personal” (it wasn’t, it was literally work) and then demand that I print out the work I was doing to give her and continued to berate me regardless, with no explanation as to what she was doing with the printout and then blocked from leaving my desk again as she continued with a hateful lecture; been told to come in if I was afraid I had COVID, against policy; have been accused of lying on multiple occasions; had another coworker apparently recruited to watch my computer monitor and report if they think I’m not working hard enough; and have overheard my boss say bad things about me and gossip about me on her phone; and have been told that family emergencies and illness are just “excuses” that I make up or exaggerate to “get out of work”. There is a massive generational divide in my office, I am the youngest person by several decades, and they have always seemed to dislike me for that. They make assumptions about me (basically “snowflake Millennial” garbage) and hate me on that basis. One of them literally laughs and shakes her head every time I enter the room.I can’t do this anymore. I contacted the Personnel Dept last week (our HR department) to discuss my treatment there, and they simply never responded to anything. I am at my wits’ end and in tears at the thought of going back - having to painfully stumble into the building, to no doubt be criticized as soon as I enter for whatever the hell it’ll be this time. On a good day, I’m subjected to the silent treatment, yelled at for transferring calls to the people for whom they were intended because they didn’t feel like talking, reminded that whatever I say (such as “Women who report rape aren’t just making it up, and can we please stop talking about a personally triggering subject in the office”) is ignorant and baby-like, and treated like I’m an idiot if I ask a question, but also I’m an idiot if I don’t ask it and end up not doing something right. I want out of here but what can I do? Do I have any rights in this situation?"
Why isn't Felony Murder applied to victims of underage sex trafficking?,"If a person robs a convenience store (commits a felony) and the clerk literally shoots and kills anyone else, the robber may be charged with Felony Murder. This protects the clerk from prosecution.If a person solicits sex from an underage person (commits a felony) and that person then shoots them, why isn't the perpetrator responsible for the death that was committed during a felony, thus protecting the victim?"
Would it be favorable or infavorable for a plaintiff in court to say “defendant said xyz when they were drunk”,Are drunk statements taken seriously by judges or disregarded?

Rights and Releases for SFW Photography on OnlyFans,"i've been a photographer freelance for almost 13 years at this point, and i'm at a weird place in life (just went through rehab, living in halfway). I'm trying to make money on top of a job i have to move out of the state i'm in, and so i had the idea of putting photography I've done for the past 15 years along with music i'm currently making/have previously made on OnlyFans. I figure it'd be an anomalous novelty having a SFW account and could be a fun way to practice marketing without social media.Never in my life as a photographer have i ever had an artist/subject sign any sort of release saying where their pictures may end up, nor have any of my contracts with venues ever restricted me from posting content anywhere online. Should I create a release form for future clients so that there is no legal blowback or, so long as all pictures are fully owned by me, am i alright?I've reviewed OnlyFans' terms of service and it doesn't seem to indicate anything about needing a paper trail in order to post pictures that i've taken. Would love some advice. Thanks!"

How to look for/websites that that show a judges ruling history?,"I looked it up online and didn't get a clear answer, but is there a way to easily look at a judge's ruling history? I saw that some trials are ruled as confidential, but I really do want all the information I can get when choosing on voting for people, and I couldn't find anywhere that showed trials that aren't confidential. I did find a site that said it would give me info, but then it told me to subscribe, and I'm not out to pay money for what should be public records, very confused on the actual situation on how to do this though. Ah, I'm in California, US. Tried to make sure there were no duplicates but didn't really know any other terms than ruling history."
This may be a stupid question but what would happen?,"In a criminal case if a defendant has evidence that incriminates them that wasn't in the police file, then are they required to present it. Would they be able to plead the fifth if it was discovered that they had such evidence? Is there a situation in any legal case where they could do that?"
Letter to Judge?,"Letter to Judge?Is this letter acceptable for my mom to send to to judge? She is the ""victim"" I'm the defendant plead not guilty at arraignment but still waiting on attorney. But she didn't want to press charges but the state picked it up I guess!? Just wanted to let the judge know but I'm not sure if this is ok?

"[What If] I get arrested, how do I get a good lawyer ASAP","We've all seen those videos, cases and warnings about how innocent people can get put in prison for years something they said or did before they got a lawyer.As someone who has never been in any legal trouble (aside from traffic/parking tickets) and has never needed the services of a lawyer, there's a lot of questions I have about how to best protect myself if unexpectedly in a situation.After being arrested, I know that I have to declare that I am invoking my Miranda right to silence.  Now, assuming that my inner circle of friends and family are in similar circumstances when it comes to the law and lawyers, how can I best find an excellent lawyer to represent me (at least during this initial phase post-arrest).  Any other things I should expect/prepare for until a lawyer is present and in charge?"

NonCompete and Restricted Zones,"Reposting hoping to get some traction..Hello,A former employer is trying to enforce a noncompete against me. I was a low level employee, and left to a new job in June. I am a remote employee for this new job. I live in Pennsylvania and live very close to my former employers office.They are now trying to enforce the 50 mile restricted zone and force me to not be able to work out of my home. They have not tried to block the employment, only make it onerous for me to be employed.2 questions:If I work two days from outside the restricted zone, does that establish a permanent business address and allow me to work from my home the other three days / week. This is what was told to me - unsure of its validity.This case law seems to be in my favor, how might I (or could I even?) use this to protect myself somehow? https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2013cv05322/481763/54/Thank you for any help!"
Libertex is charging for investigating money they lost while closing my account,Libertex forced me to close my account as all uk entities are being closed. However when closing my account they sent my funds to my bank account (provided a transaction confirmation) but it’s been weeks and I don’t have the funds. My bank says they can’t find traces and only the sender can withdraw the transaction… Libertex are saying they need to charge me 70 euro to investigate via their bank. Is it on me to be paying them for loosing my money? The 70 euro charge is not worth the money I would get back if they find it… but by principle I am annoyed at them.
how should I go about getting my money back from someone who left the state,"Back in May I loaned a friend of mine a large sum of money along with a written contract, he was supposed to pay back in spetember but has blocked me on social media and all form of contact. Before he broke contact he mentioned he'd get the authorities involved if I continue to ""harass"" him for payment (he mentioned in the past he needed to be reminded of things because he has a TBI) Now he's moved to a different state and I don't know his current address to so I can't state a claim in small claims court How would I be able to proceed to get my money back?"
Are security guards and shop assistants/owners legally allowed to detain you?,"When I was a kid (14/15) the security guards at our local shopping centre said me and my friend were loitering (we were just sitting on the bench) and said we had to leave.We tried to explain we were just sitting there, but 2-3 security guards were called and forcefully dragged us into a back room and waited for the police to arrive...Were they legally allowed to do this, or how does it work?(same thing if they catch you stealing/fighting/etc, what are they LEGALLY allowed to do)I am sure the statutes of limitations or whatever it's called has run out, this was nearly 20 years ago now, but it's something I've wondered loads since then, if they were legally allowed to do this.Thanks in advance,Mr C.B.P.S."
Is it common for the judge in a divorce case to ask questions like he was an attorney on the defense side?,I think I might have pissed him off but at the same time I think that it is out of line for a judge....
Father passed without a living will- girlfriend wants items in safe,"My father recently passed away without a living will. He has two children, me and my brother. He has put most of his assets in precious metals that are in a safe with his girlfriend (they own an apartment together, but the deed is to her). The girlfriend has access to the safe, and thinks this money is for ""her retirement"".My father has told over 8 people that his wishes are that the precious metals go to me and my brother, and that he trusts his girlfriend to open the safe and give it to us -_-.  Well, we went to collect the items from the safe, and she immediately lied about the location of the safe. She does not speak much English, so we also have language barrier, and sometimes need to call a family friend to translate.After we confronted her about the location of the safe, and that we were not going to leave without the contents of the safe because it is ours (my father purchased the majority of these items with my grandfather's inheritance who we are very close to, we were also NOT estranged from my father) she called the cops to remove us from the house. The cops sided with us and said that what is in the safe is rightfully ours as we are his children. When the situation did not go her way, she faked a medical emergency and had EMS come to the house and we all had to leave- she locked the door to the room with the safe and pretended to lost the keys when the cops asked her to bring us to the safe.ANYWAY, we are kind of at a lost of actions to do here without these metals going missing. We were able to get purchase receipts and records from my dad's emails with his name on his purchases and the accounts. Some of the metals have serial numbers but not all. We have the serial numbers to some but not all that have serial numbers. We have a rough estimate of a value of over 200k. He also has other belonging at this house- but nothing we are too concerned with like clothing and other nonsense. But we do need his laptops.We have delivered her a letter of demand listing the items we need to retrieve, and we have a lot of evidence texts and witness accounts that she confirmed the precious metals are in the safe (not the exact amount).  She has other done other illegal things prior to his death and after. My father was a vulnerable person, and she took advantage of that. We will be delivering a second letter asking for 3X the damages if she does not comply. Right now she is not communicating with us, by phone or answering the door.We cannot open probate yet because we do not have the death certificate. We will be hopefully getting that sometime this week, but time is dwindling as she has access to all of these precious metals. It is the weekend, but we will be filing a police report and reporting the items stolen. Now, we are still trying to get her to comply, but then of course the items could be missing from the safe.Looking for guidance on what else we could do.... We have spoken to an attorney but as I mentioned we cannot start until we have the death certificate."
How legal are online raffles? Like Requiring a purchase of a shirt to get an entry per dollar to win a prize like a car. (USA-TENNESSEE),"I've been seeing a couple companies giving away hot sports car. In order to enter you have to by something from their site and for every dollar you spend, you get enteries in to the contest. I don't see an alternate way of entering on their sites but in the rules they start with no purchase necessary. Every time I look it up I come away thinking it's very illegal in the US to run a paid raffle online or in person and seen stories about raffle groups on Facebook getting shut down by the police or like occasionally a church getting in trouble because someone who didn't win their raffle reporting them to the police. So I gotta know how are these sites getting away with giving away these cars? Is there a state where paid raffles are okay and they are just incorporated there? I am in the US in Tennessee, id like to do a raffle for my charity."
Why is Contempt of Congress not seen as a serious crime?,"It flabbergasts me that a person can ignore an order from the US Congress and receive only a fine and a few months jail time. I'm admittedly pretty naive about legal matters, but it seems like the more egregious cases should be treated as felonies.Are there good practical reasons why Congressional orders shouldn't come with the threat of a felony (i.e. beyond just established law and precedent)? Is that seen as being too easy for a partisan legislature to abuse? Or just part of the pattern of white collar crimes being seen as less serious?Thanks!"
Owner of Property Co-habitation Consequences,"Hello,I'm in the state of Washington and I'm looking to separate from my live-in girlfriend of four years.

"Stock Shares, Dividends, Inheritances & Commingling","I plan to leave stock shares that pay quarterly dividends to my children.  Currently I live in Virginia. One heir lives in Virginia and a second lives in Utah.It is my understanding that inherited property is not subject to marital asset division as long as it has not been commingled with marital assets. But my question is, are the dividends and potential increase in stock valuation subject to marital law and asset division in event of divorce? If so, is there a way to protect dividends and earnings from becoming a marital asset in a potential divorce?"
Can a parent sue a child for money that was used when the child was still in their care?,"This may seem like dumb question, but one I'm honestly interested in knowing. If a parent pays for for a meal, that will feed their child, or a friend of their child's, can they parent later sue the child or friend to get that money back. That's just an example, but could something like that happen? (The child or friend would be a minor when the meal was paid for and then over 18 when sued.)Edit: this could also apply to a parent loaning their child money while the child is still a minor."

Who Owns the Copyright?,"I want to make a painting of an area of the city I live in, which has a lot of advertisements and some professional art galleries. There are 2 galleries within the frame I would like to paint. There are more than 1 artist's works visible in the scene. Would it be infringing their ownership to include renditions of their work in my painting? Would I be infringing on trademarks by including the advertisments I can see in the frame? I feel like they are in context of the cityscape I am painting and to remove them would cause the painting to lose the feel I want to preserve.Could I sell a photograph of this instance without censoring it for trademark/copyright issues?"

Case filed against me by doctor and their attorney even after I paid my debt in Virginia,"I got a demand letter in the mail a week ago. I called up the plaintiff because I knew them from a prior medical visit. Asked them what was going on, long story short they sent bills to the address but not my apartment number and never heard from me. I asked for my itemized bill and paid it right then and there. I have my receipt, my itemized bill, and credit card statement showing the doctors practice.While this is happening, I see no court date on the court site with the date that was posted on the demand letter.Fast forward to today, and I get another letter with the demand letter being filled out and showing signatures to appear in court on a specific date by the same plaintiff. I check the court records and sure enough I have a court case for ""motion for judgement"".I immediately call the doctor, they say it's been paid already. So I call the lawyers office next and they say the same thing. (I've recorded both of these conversations as well). I ask them why a case was still made two days after my payment was posted. They state ""you can ignore that notice, it came in late and we've deemed the debt settled. You do not need to appear in court, the lawyer (plaintiffs lawyer) will inform the judge it was nullified"". I don't believe them so I ask for a letter stating what was discussed and that my debt is settled, and to send me email confirmation as well. I did not get an email yet, and I'm doubtful I'll see the letter by Monday. I don't trust it.If they DO send me a letter, can I go to the county clerks office and have the case cancelled myself?What can I do? I already could barely afford the first payment, I can't do another with added court fees PLUS 25% INTEREST!!What should I do? I've been an emotional wreck all day trying to figure out next steps.Tl;Dr: doctor sued me, I paid debt, was told all is well, got another letter and a court case, being told to ignore it and not show up, requested a letter stating debt was paid, don't expect to receive it."
What are my chances in a contractor dispute?,"Homeowner here who has been planning a bath remodel for a year, and waiting almost as long due to pandemic delays. The time has finally arrived, and now that we’re at the plumbing rough-in stage, the sub has decided he needs $5k more to do the work, as it’s “more complicated and higher-tech than I expected”. That’s almost a 20% bump in the total bid, and way more than I’m willing to pay. My case is that: A) been working with the GC for a year on this, he knows the project well (he’s now claiming he didn’t know I was buying high-end stuff that’s more precise to install) and B) I have emails with responses from him to my questions such as, “this is a fancy, complicated spa-like install, are you sure this quote includes that” because it was vague) a year ago when I signed.  He responded both affirmatively to the complexity (ceiling rain shower, body sprays and separate hand shower) and separately to the quote being valid for it. C) the contractor (should call him GC I suppose) confirmed with me that the plumbing sub can come on-site last Friday to finalize the bid. Someone came, didn’t see who, the GC’s super handled it. As far as I can tell they only looked at the installation site, as they didn’t go to the garage where the parts are. D) Tuesday of this week plumbing was supposed to start; two kids showed up 90 minutes late. I showed them to the job, and they said, “wow, too complicated for us, our boss said he’ll be out to do this on Thursday”. E) today the “boss” was here for 3 hours (also 90 minutes late) reading instruction books that came with the valves and decided he was underbid, and whelp?Here we are. Nothing installed, and my GC is withholding work until we “iron out” the pricing. My POV is that we’ve done that, and I have evidence to support that. He hung up on me, so I know I’m on the right side, but if I have to take him to court (contract is $32k, so not small claims I think?) to finish the work, do I have good enough chances to start seeking legal representation now? I don’t think we’ll reach an agreement otherwise; unless you think I’m being unreasonable? I haven’t much experience with contractors…former DIY’er whose time is short but wallet isn’t flexible enough to just eat the increase. I can PROBABLY do the rough-in myself, if push comes to shove."
Need help,"Hello. I have a question and don’t know if anyone can help. Long story short. I hooked up with a guy  and got pregnant 1 month in. I didn’t even really know much about him. The more I found out the more I decided us dating just wasn’t going to work. He tried to fit a year worth of relationship in that month. Like saying “I love you”, “put me on your phone plan” “let’s move in”. I have a few kids. They are well behaved and very sweet. He also has a few kids but they are the complete opposite. They get introuble for smoking weed, playing with guns, vulgar. The list goes on. I am really worried that this baby will end up like his others. Can I use the stuff I know to keep the baby from living with him. Idc for supervised visits or what not. I just want to prevent another one turning out like them."

How specific do terroristic / criminal threats have to be?,"Could you explain what elements go into deciding whether or not a statement is specific enough to constitute a terroristic threat?I ask to help me make sense of the following scenario which takes place in the state of Tenn:I was hanging out with 3 friends at one of their apartments a few nights ago. An unexpected 4th guest showed up, one I'm not a fan of or comfortable around, and I expressed my discomfort to host's boyfriend. He offered to drive me back to his place, as the night was almost over and an uber was super expensive back to my place. Nothing happened sexually. But that didn't stop the host from freaking out about the potential for hooking up.In a chain of emotionally charged texts like ""I hope you fucking die you lieing fake ass piece of shit"" and ""I hope you rot in hell you fucking piece of lieing shit"", he texted ""Hope nothing happens to Daniel's car. It's dangerous out there."" When we got back to my car the next day, all 4 tires had been slashed. The host claims that he had nothing to do with it, obviously. But is this threat vague enough to constitute a terroristic threat in the state of tennesssee?"
Can I sue the bar?,"I went to a local bar in Georgia a month ago. I was there a few minutes maybe 10-20 I hadn’t even ordered a drink. Suddenly, and without me doing anything, two guys told me I had to leave due to some girl who works there didn’t want me there (my ex from decades ago) I stepped outside the bar’s property line and sat down as I was waiting for a friend I had previously planned to meet at this bar. The same two guys walked up and grabbed my phone and backpack (which had my meds and cash and clothes in it) And walked off up the street and turned down a side street. I followed them and caught up to them far off the bars property. They both squared off against me and once one of them pushed me, an altercation started and one of them got cut on the forehead These guys were not wearing any kind of uniform or even a shirt with the bars name on it Apparently they were employees of the bar. They called police and accused me of aggravated assault and a warrant was put out for my arrest Can i legally sue the establishment for damages caused to me and my family because of this? I feel they had no right to take my property and walk off with it. Plus the fact that there was no indication that they were employees of the bar no did they identify themselves as employees or bouncers to me."
Police report information please,Not sure if this is the right place to ask.. I know someone very dear to me that was found deceased in a shallow creek a little over a year ago.. They say the cause of death was drowning but i think there's way more to the story.. But anyway my question is: Isn't a police report suppose to always be done regardless? There was never a police report done on my little brother..they say its because the coroner said it was drowning.. Is this true? Thank you
Confronting someone at their home uninvited,I’ve had personal issues with someone’s spouse from work (long story).Earlier in the year they found out where i would be (an hour away) and drove down to where my kid and I were to confront me.Just this last week the spouse came to my front door at night in a Halloween costume with a MASK to once again yell at me.Can I sue? Can I press charges? Both times I felt very unsafe and scared for my life and my child’s life. It’s one thing to tell someone “hey we need to talk”. Its another to show up unannounced and uninvited AT NIGHT to someone’s home IN A MASK.What are the illegal ramifications here?
(Texas) Audio recorded with out consent.,"(Throw away account) It has been brought to my attention that a private conversation between me and a friend was recorded at my place of employment with out either of our consents.On my lunch break, I was clocked out, in confidence I said somethings about my manager to a friend. Unaware that another coworker had left a recording device in their bag in the intention to record our conversation.The coworker brought the recording to my manager and they reported me to HR via that coworker.HR called and talked to me today. I denied everything. If I'm not mistaken an audio recording of non-consenting parties is illegal. Both my friend and I were not aware of being recorded.If my company decides to terminate me what legal actions can I take if any at all?I must mention that this is a California based company but this happened in Texas."
Shopify f1 student,"Hi everyone, I am an international student living in California, and I wondered if there was any way for a student with an F1 visa to start an open business online. From what I have read, and from what I understood, it seems that it is possible to own a business, as long as I don't benefit from the company and that I do not provide any kind of work towards it.

Lawyer displaying signs of Alzheimer’s - what do we do??,"My brother recently got into trouble and our family pooled our money together to hire a criminal lawyer who came recommended to us. Yesterday, my brother met with the lawyer for the second time to discuss his upcoming preliminary hearing and the lawyer asked him who he was when he arrived. Then, throughout the 30 min meeting, the lawyer asked him SIX times if my brother knew any of the people involved - not in a way where he was double-checking - but like he never asked before. The lawyer is of an advanced age. The charges are fairly serious but we pooled all our money for the lawyer’s retainer. We want that money back so we can hire someone else. Is this possible? What can we do? Thank you"

Class action lawsuit against Agero,"Hello,In short, I'm paying for a roadside assistance service with State Farm and they partner up with another company called Agero. I waited for a tow truck and no one showed up for up to 7 hours when I was completely stranded in the middle of nowhere. They couldn't assign anyone for me and they also wanted me to pay extra for an ""out of network"" tow truck. AAA showed up within 45 mins. Agero offered $20 compensation for all of this which I refused.This is the full story...I'm from Oklahoma and I spoke with several different lawyers in regard to a class action against Agero. I have Agero as my roadside assistant via state farm. I have seen so many people having issues with them. I will explain my situation below and please share your experience as well. Let's make this stop for good. I will also want to mention that they offered me a $20 gift card as compensation which I refused.On Saturday, October 1, 2022, our car was disabled in the Wichita Mountains near Indiahoma, OK. There was no cellular reception where the vehicle was located, making a sticky situation even stickier. We were able to find a ride and cell reception at the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge Visitor’s Center approximately 6 miles from where the vehicle was disabled.At approximately 4:50 pm on October 1, 2022, I contacted Agero (State Farm provider/partner) for Roadside Assistance. After a somewhat long wait (high call volumes) I was able to reach a representative and set up a tow from Indiahoma, OK to Legend Honda in Lawton, OK. I checked the request online after receiving the text message, and the representative I spoke with put the vehicle location as the Visitor’s Center, and not actually where the vehicle was disabled despite being provided an address and the GPS coordinates. This may have just been a minor misunderstanding on their part, but we made it clear that we couldn’t wait with the vehicle due to lack of cell phone coverage, so we had to wait until the driver called us to let us know they were on their way before heading there (if something happened they wouldn’t be able to reach us nor would we be able to reach them).As soon as I realized this, I placed another phone call to Roadside Assistance and gave them the correct location of the vehicle, and the request was updated. No driver had been assigned yet. At about 5:30, we had to leave the visitor’s center as they were closed and had to close the gate to their parking lot, so at this point, we were illegally parked and waited on the side of the road as there was nowhere to go within a reasonable distance to the vehicle due to lack of cell phone coverage.I then remembered that I have Hondacare included with my bumper-to-bumper factory warranty for my vehicle, so I contacted them as well and opened a request for a tow with them. At this point, it was after 9 pm. Hondacare uses the AAA network, and we were given an estimated wait time of about 1 and a half to 2 hours max. No one had been assigned to my request at Agero (state farm partner) yet.Shortly after I made my request with Hondacare, I received a call from Agero (State Farm provider/partner) roadside assistance stating that they contacted all in-network providers and no one accepted the case.I was starting to get frustrated as it’s been over 4 hours already, and I am illegally parked, stranded in the middle of nowhere. The representative stated that no one in-network could take the request, but they could try again in 2 hours. We asked them to try again in half an hour, and they said they would. I was being very patient with them.We waited for another hour, then got another call from the Agero (State Farm provider/partner) Roadside Assistance representative. They said once again that no one was available to tow us. However, we could go out of network and pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket and then apply for reimbursement.We weren’t going to do that, we pay for a service that is supposed to provide us with towing that we pay monthly for, and we need to get this service that we are paying for. The representative also told us that there was one that may be able to come in 4 hours (that would put us at 12 am-1 am waiting time from the beginning at 4:50om). We asked that they keep trying. At this point, it was starting to get dark. Really dark since it was a mountain road.We waited another hour or so, and then called Agero once again. Given the situation, the representative escalated the request. I requested a supervisor, and the representative said she contacted her supervisor and there was a wait, and placed me on hold. In the meantime, my request seemed to magically have a driver assigned and we would have a 1-hour wait (this is after giving them a statement from a lawyer that I called so they provided me with a driver immediately after). Even more interesting, the tow company was the same one that was offered prior out of pocket for hundreds of dollars. I got sick of waiting for the supervisor and had the number of the tow truck driver in the request, so I reached out to them myself and it was confirmed that it would be about an hour as he was dropping a vehicle off in Lawton as we spoke then would head straight to us.An hour passed, and we contacted the tow truck driver again. He still has not left Lawton and was still dropping off the previous vehicle. This was getting fishy, but he told us another 30 minutes or so and that he would be there. I waited another 30 minutes, then called the driver again and they sent me to voicemail. At this point, I called Agero Roadside Assistance once again to see what was going on.Since it had been more than an hour and a half, Agero canceled that tow and started looking for another tow, they admitted that this should have been reassigned after 60 minutes.I requested to be transferred to a supervisor, and had a long wait time again, but was eventually transferred to Charlotte. While this was happening, I got a call from the owner of the towing company (Liberty Tow), stating that the payment card that was provided by Agero was getting declined and his employee wasn’t comfortable coming out to get us until this was resolved. This was guaranteed to be another half hour after this was resolved for them to get to us since they were coming out of Lawton and hadn’t left yet, so I told them to just not bother coming at all.I had a long discussion with Charlotte (supervisor) that this situation was unacceptable and she apologized for this satiation and said they were working hard as we spoke to find us another driver. After much discussion, she asked for 20 minutes and she or an associate would call us regardless of whether or not they found anyone. About 15 minutes after hanging up the phone with Charlotte, the tow from Hondacare showed up. They use AAA and they showed pretty quickly.After the driver from Hondacare got us out and we returned to cell phone coverage (about 11 pm), I checked the request with Agero and there still was no driver assigned to our case. I went ahead and canceled the request after an additional 2 hours just to see if someone would be assigned or not. Not a surprise here, as no one was assigned. I also have no record of ever getting a call from Agero after the 20 minutes I was told about. Upon checking further to be 100% sure, it appears that there was no call back from them."

I provided a doctor’s note to WFH for two weeks. My employer does not believe that they have to follow it and still want me to come into the office.,"Missouri. Local government. I’ve actually posted before about my hostile work environment, and I’ve been recording everything that happens and gathering evidence. So this is what happened today.I sprained my ankle on Thursday. Initially, the doctor at urgent care told me it was broken and recorded it as such on the paperwork she gave me, but gave me no further paperwork regarding work except to go back on Monday. That didn’t really make much sense to me, but she told me that they don’t really handle those notes unless it’s workers comp related, and to bring it up with the orthopedist she referred me to as to whether or not I should go to the office, WFH, whichever. Well, weird, but whatever. I worked on Monday, it was absolute hell. The urgent care doctor had put me on crutches, and holy hell, are they hard. Going to the bathroom took me twenty minutes in our old, outdated building, and walking to and from my car was such a hassle that one of my coworkers actually grabbed a wheelchair for me.The earliest I got into the orthopedist was today. She said that my ankle wasn’t actually broken, but was sprained. Again, weird, but whatever. She gave me a note saying to WFH for two weeks, until my follow-up appointment, due to the need to not put too much weight on my foot or walk around too much, and use one crutch (instead of both) when I walked. They faxed a letter over to my office, and I called to ensure that they received it.My boss answered, I told her the situation, and she immediately started trying to get me to say that I had specifically requested the doctor to give me this note. I almost felt like I was being recorded. She kept repeating, “So you asked the doctor to give you that note, though?” in an accusatory tone. I told her I did not, because I did not.I knew that she would tell the higher-ups that I said that, or she’d tell them that I didn’t, but that she “knew I was lying”, just like before, so all I could do was just tell the truth and say that this is what the doctor told me to do since it was an option (better than not working at all, which was the only other one).She said that she didn’t think they accepted doctors notes for sprains. She said that “all the other people here” (which is nobody) over the years always came in and worked in the office with sprains. I told her blankly that I didn’t know what to tell her, because, well, I didn’t. She said she’d talk it over with our higher-ups, but didn’t think they’d do it.This job has just been absolute hell. I have never dealt with such a petty, childish, and vindictive group of people before in my life. At this point, I’ve had one job interview and got asked to do another, but I don’t want to get my hopes up for either one, for obvious reasons. But I’m wondering if I should just quit and sue. It’s gone on for too long already."

hello legal side of reddit input/ advice needed,"So for context I was on a now questionable app and started talking to this person. We switched to whatsapp to continue the conversation. She said she was ""bored"" and wanted to trade nudes which I declined. She then wanted to be in a relationship with me.  Again I declined cause I felt uncomfortable due to the 10+ age gap. She wanted a picture of me and I sent a pic of a random guy.  And then she asked for the name of the high school.  She sent an edited image of the fake picture I sent next to a random picture of a guy's junk with my phone number my first name and name of my high school. She said if I didn't do what she wanted she would post it to social media and that it will ruin my life (i had her block me by the way).

Why Do Youtube Videos Never Seem To Need Citation?,"Hello, Legal Reddit.I've got a question I've always wondered about, and I was hoping someone on here could shed some light on this particular conundrum.I've been working on a short video piece for a class, and while I'll certainly be making some sort of citation document on the side to go along with my submission for the educational side of things, there's something I've always been curious about on the video side of the equation that has always stood out to me as a researcher.When on Youtube, like many, I've fallen down the ""documentary"" rabbit hole many times. Like any good documentary, many of these videos will point to things like historical documents, scientific papers, or anything else that might be useful as a source. That being said, however, when it comes time to credit these sources, many of these videos get away with just listing the name of the document or vaguely specifying the organization before moving promptly along.Down in the description, occasionally you might also find links to some of the resources, but rarely does it link to all of the images, text, or other media it might use in it's production.My question is, especially for very profitable channels such as perhaps ""Game Theory"" or ""The Infographic Show"", how exactly do they get away with that? Is it legal? Is it a case of something not being solidified and therefore being a grey area? What makes a video, if so, immune from a bibliography?Thank you for your time!"
What lengths must I go to return a deposit?,"Bought a property a few years ago, the management company ran its invoices one year in arrears so my solicitor secured a deposit from the seller to cover these, with the intention of returning the remainder to the seller once the invoices were up to date from when we purchased to property.A few months ago I received a letter from my solicitor with a cheque in it basically saying: we have spent X many years trying to return remaining balance to the seller through their solicitor and we haven’t heard anything back. We have even sent them a cheque a year ago and it wasn’t cached so we are going to release the funds to you.The value of the cheque is in the hundreds, so not an insignificant amount of money. Especially when energy bills are going up the way they are. I have contacted the estate agent to see if they have a contact number for the seller to see if they can put us in touch and I can transfer the money to them but have heard nothing back. I don’t know their name so can’t look them up and the estate agent can’t tell me due to GDPRUltimately it is their money, they deserve to have it back. But also, how long/far is it reasonable to pursue getting it back to them before giving up. I don’t want to finally give up, accept it as an unexpected windfall and spend it (probably on the mortgage) only to then contacted by them afterwards."
Not excused for Jury Duty but can't attend,"Hi all - I've been summoned for jury duty and have an extended work trip exactly coinciding with the trial period. I realize that excusal seems to only be for personal and unmovable trips...but this isn't exactly a casual two day work trip that I can just do another time (everything already booked, paid for, and agenda set weeks in advance). I went to the first day where you do the questionnaires and I did try to talk to the judge ( got that they would consider but that this is a ""employer"" problem), but I have to leave on the trip before the next summons time (when I assume the interviews happen). I don't think I can claim I didn't receive the notice since I did the honest thing and went in for the first day...so what happens if I just can't go the second summons date? thanks for any advice"
Legal ramifications of a protestor getting killed while blocking traffic.,"We've all seen those videos online of people protesting various things by intentionally standing in the way of traffic, and there are always comments on those videos from people saying something to the effect of ""if that was me in the car, I'd just hit them lol!""That got me wondering what would be the legal consequences of that actually happening. Suppose the protestor died and their family pressed charges. Or if the protestor didn't die but was severely injured and wanted to press charges personally. Suppose the operator of the vehicle tried in good faith to honk or slow down, basically everything short of actually stopping their car? Or suppose they made the defense that they didn't see the protester? How would that play out in court? Would the fact that the protestor knowingly put themselves in danger provide any legal defense to the driver?"

(US) I know of a military guy who keeps marrying poor women to get family loans and other types of family assistance from the military and then abuses and ditches the women.

To intentionally make things so untolerable she would run away to church, parks, all day to avoid seeing him. The day she called police, he said he would help her get plane tickets....

Power of Attorney vs. Executor,"My grandfather passed away over the weekend. He had listed my mother as his power of attorney and executor when they did his will last year.My grandfather removed her as POA over a week ago (without her knowledge) and added his sister. He did not make any existing changes to the will, including the executor.While we were at the funeral home today, the director said that POA’s have no power once the person (my grandfather) dies. Everything is passed on to the executor.This has caused a whole slew of issues, especially with finances. My grandfathers lawyer told my mother that she needs to pay him $2100 in order for him to reinstate her as the POA, even though now it literally means nothing. And he did confirm with her that she is the still the executor.Is this right even though the POA is now useless?!Edit: to clarify I am based in Ontario, Canada."

How is what Davantae Adams did assault and not battery?,"For those who don't know, Davantae Adams is a famous football player who recently shoved a photographer after a game. This morning he was formally cited for misdemeanor assault.I was taught that common law assault is causing someone an injury without making contact -- for example if I pretend to punch you and you flinch and hit your head on something -- that is assault. Battery, I was taught, is when there is any contact whatsoever. I was told assault and battery are frequently confused.Now I am confused though because Adams did make contact with the photographer, so shouldn't he be charged with misdemeanor battery and not assault?Thank you in advance."

Executor withholding information regarding my inheritance?,"Hello reddit! I have a question regarding myself as a beneficiary to my grandfather’s estate. (I am in ONTARIO CANADA) My grandfather died a year ago and made a relative the executor to this estate. Myself and 3 cousins (4 people total including myself) are beneficiaries to this property.The relative who was executor to this estate had not shown any beneficiaries of any of the estate the will. They basically mentioned to me in passing that I was 1/4 beneficiaries to the property in question and that it was being sold.I have three questions regarding this.The property sold a week + ago and I have heard nothing. Is there a deadline for when I shall receive my portion of the proceeds from the sale?What action can I take/ what would my next step be, if they do not pay me in a timely manner?Will proceeds of the sale be used to pay land transfer tax and other fees? I was told by the executor that a large chunk of my profit will be taken for this purpose. How can I know I am receiving the correct amount of money?I asked very gently today about the property in question as I noticed it had sold. The executor responded “yes it sold.” And did not give any more information..I have not been prying or asking because other beneficiaries of my grandfather’s other properties were asking questions and it destroyed their relationship with the executor.. I feel that I am unreasonably being left in the dark. I have an excellent relationship with the executor and now, upon asking the first question ever regarding my inheritance, they have become very short with me.I am young and inexperienced with this so any information is greatly appreciated…"

Pre-Check/Global Entry revoked because of THC gummies. Any chance I could appeal given the marijuana reforms just announced by Biden?,"I was singled out for a very intensive CBP search upon my return to San Francisco from a trip to Mexico two years ago. Agents found 3 THC gummies which they tested and confirmed on-site. I wasn't arrested or fined but my Trusted Traveler status (Global Entry & Pre-Check) was revoked almost immediately.Biden's announcement today indicates that he would pardon ""all prior Federal offenses of simple possession of marijuana."" There were no criminal proceedings/arrests/charges related to this situation. I'm curious if ""offenses"" might possibly include my foolish mistake, allowing me to appeal the Trusted Traveler revocation.It it matters, I'm a resident of California and the incident happened in California. California allows personal consumption of recreational marijuana and the amount I posssessed was far below CA's legal limit. I also was granted a medicinal use card in the past but it was expired at the time of this incident.I recognize that Biden's announcement is very new but I would appreciate any insight at this time. I would really like to get my Pre-Check status back! Thanks!"

"[US] If someone moves a lot in their sleep and hurts/damages someone else, can they be sued?","Purely hypothetical, this hasn't happened to me or anyone I know. But yeah, if someone moves around a lot in their sleep, say with a lot of arm or leg movements, and while sleeping next to someone they unconsciously hit or kick them or something in a way that causes actual harm - for example, say they get punched in the eye, or something moves in such a way as that it snaps a finger, or something like that - can the person be sued for something like assault?I know details matter for this, so let me flesh out this hypothetical a bit more: let's assume that the two are recently dating and sleeping in the same bed for the first time; Person X (the victim) agrees to sleep next to Person Y (the sleep attacker), and was told that Person Y moves around a lot in their sleep, but was given no indication that it might put Person X in harm's way - after all, plenty of people sleep together, but who warns their sleeping partner that sleeping together would be legitimately dangerous? To me, that seems like a reasonable enough overall context."

Would my friend be prosecuted if she sought legal action?,"Shortly put, my good friend was sexually assaulted a few weeks ago. She was staying the night with a mutual good friend who unfortunately took advantage of her while she was asleep. She asked about my thoughts on legal action, and I gave her my advice to take legal action.Now, I think we have enough evidence to make a case. We have texts between them where he confessed to doing it, both with her and with her boyfriend. I was also with them that night (I left before they went to bed), and I have video evidence that they were together that night.The only problem is this: they were both drinking, and they were both 19 (I'm also 19, but I didn't drink because I had to drive home for the night). He was the one who possessed the alcohol and gave it to her. I'm not going to speak on their levels of intoxication other than to say that it appeared that she was drunker than he was. Her concern is that in order to pursue legal action, she would have to admit to underage drinking, which in our state is a third-class misdemeanor, punishable by up to a month in jail or a $500 fine.I'm wondering if she would be persecuted for her drinking, if she would be able to get a plea deal of some sort, or if her charges would be waived under the circumstances.Please help me out here. In the messages he sent her the next day, he confessed to doing the same to several other girls in the past, and I want him to be brought to justice for his actions. I don't want him to get away because my friend is afraid to be punished."

HOA Dispute,"My HOA (condo complex) recently held an unannounced vote to remove dumpsters from the community in favor of trash cans with curbside pickups. The problem is that there was no planning for storage of the new trash cans for the upstairs units. The layouts of the condos are you walk in the front door, and there is an 8’ long x 4’ wide space to the left when the front door is open leading to the stairs that take you into the living room/kitchen. In speaking with the HOA, they have said that all downstairs units can store their bins in the back, however the upstairs units are required to keep outdoor trash cans in this entry way area. The width of the trash cans is 29.75” leaving residents just an 18” gap to get into their homes. The HOAs response so far has been if you don’t like it you can leave the community (residents own the units). The majority of units are occupied by elderly individuals with mobility problems and while not only does leaving trash in the entry way of a home welcome pests carrying disease, but it also impedes those trying to get in and out of their units most of which have mobility issues. Do I have a case here, and is it worth procuring a lawyer? I am dumbfounded that the HOA thinks it is remotely acceptable to force residents to store 96 gallon trash bins in the entryway of our homes more than halving the space."

Dad wants me to create a separate checking account in my name for him to use,He is asking to create a separate checking account at a bank where I don't have a checking account so that he can hide his cash from his wife before he file for divorce. His wife created a lot of credit card debt while he doesn't have debt any under his name. Plus they share a mortgage. He consulted with a divorce lawyer and found out they would have to share the debt when they separate. So that is why he is wanting to hide his assets under my name.I don't mind creating a checking account but don't want to run into legal issues down the road.

My mother who I had not spoken to in over ten years for major reasons (like scamming me into a life insurance policy after getting a job in life insurance, which I paid on and she cashed in on and putting her mortgage in my name when I turned 18 and never paid on among MANY other messed up things), heard I was pregnant and that my ex left me while pregnant and she took me to court for custody of my child. It was like living in the twilight zone.She called the department of child services and told them I was on drugs so then we engaged in 6 months of absolute BS in court. I won obviously but it was after months of hair follicle drug tests (which, for those who don’t know is a CHUNK of hair), multiple court dates, multiple home visitations from dcs etc.When I got pregnant I was not aware for 12 weeks due to having only one working ovary and only 3-4 periods a year so I was honest with my doctor about smoking cannabis because I wanted to know if my baby was going to be okay since I didn’t know for so long. The baby was fine and I stopped taking my medication and stopped smoking cannabis. With that being in my medical history, the judge and my mother/ her lawyer really held that over my head but it was clear I stopped since drug tests in the hospital and all subsequent tests showed I was clean. The judge said I should be charged with child endangerment because I admitted to smoking while pregnant (this was at the second court date out of 5). I’m in Tennessee and I guess that’s a thing here since it’s not legal. I was never told I was being charged with anything and I won so I don’t think I have anything to worry about and I’d assume I would know if I was charged with child endangerment but I’m up for a job teaching children (which is what I went to school for and did before the pandemic).Should I run a background check on myself to be sure and if so, how can I know what background checks are reliable? I did one meant for employers under my LLC and it came up totally clean but I can’t help but worry. Should I call my old lawyer? I’m not sure how I can find out if the judge was just an old conservative jerk or if he did in fact list me for child endangerment for smoking cannabis when I didn’t even know I was pregnant."
my wife who is a IMMIGRANT WHO LIVES IN FLORIDA with me is asking I sign a spousal support that UCIS says is a requirement,"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/guides/F3en.pdfMy wife came here through her ex-husband. She is showing me this f3en pdf form that says I need to sign a spousal support .  My wife is insisting the paralegal says I need to sign this but shes already lived here for 6 years with her legally immigrated ex-husband, so im not sure why I have to sign a spousal support waiver when it clearly states there are for people outside the country immigrating in (and through a relative at that)."

Medical malpractice?,"Hi everyone, in the state of OR. Went at the beginning of august to get a calcium deposit removed by a derm surgeon. I asked them to keep the stitches in longer as I’m immunocompromized and know I take longer to heal. Was ignored and stitches came out after 2 weeks. The wound opened up and has been open since. Follow up with the derm concluded with him telling me to use nonstick pads and antibiotic ointment. Finally talked to my primary who ordered wound care and both nurses who have looked at the wound said his instructions were not the best and recommended I see a different derm. I’ve had to take time off work ( that I’ve been at less than a year) and have had hair loss from the stress. Does this rise to the level of medical malpractice or did I just have an idiot doctor?"
Guardianship Transfer,"I granted my sister temporary guardianship in Georgia. She moved with my child to Florida. Did not notify me or the courts, but I found out because my child told me. It was fine as I moved to Florida as well. I've been wanting to take my child back but my sister kept insisting I wasn't ready. My child wants to move back in. This past week she took my child out of school and put her at my parents so she could go on holiday with her boyfriend. Now she's missing school. Before my sister left she expressed to my parents she didn't want to have my child anymore. I begged her to talk to me. She's ignored all my text and only sent ""I talked with Dad, he's going to take over from here"" I do NOT want my child at my parents. Is this even legal? Can she transfer guardianship without my consent? How can I take back my child?"
I have proof my ex-employer is committing fraud - what can I do?,Old company I worked for (4-5 years ago) that I was fired from (unrelated to the fraud) is committing some level of fraud. I used to be the QA manager and forged the reports for them for their biggest customer. Is there anyway to bring this forward and if so how would I do it and would I receive compensation? Also would it be illegal to sell the evidence to the customer? Sorry if it’s vague but I’m just looking for a starting place.

Missouri. Hostile work environment. Considering quitting but I’m not sure if I’ll get unemployment.,"I posted about this almost a month ago and didn’t get a response, but I’m desperate. I am the youngest person in my office and my political views do not match theirs (not that I’m super vocal about it but they sure are) and I am beginning most mornings in years before I go in.Most recently, one of my bosses decided I must have a second job. This is because I took time off to drop off, pick up and care for my dog during and after she underwent heartworm treatment. She took me back to her desk in front of the public and berated me for ten minutes and repeatedly demanded to know what my second job was. I told her every time that I didn’t have one (I don’t). She evidently decided I was lying, that I was making up excuses (I wasn’t), and called our superior boss to report that I had a second job and was lying about it. I DO NOT HAVE A SECOND JOB. I HAVE A SICK DOG WHO WAS GETTING TREATMENT.I was then ordered to go into superior boss’s office to get berated and asked about my “second job” AGAIN. They kept telling me as well that “everyone has problems and they don’t bring them to work” (I am currently losing my home and car due to my partner cheating on me and leaving me with another woman while at the same time starting jokes and rumors that ruined my reputation; I can’t afford them on my own and sometimes I’ll go to the bathroom and break down for a few minutes because I have no family nowhere to go and no one that actually loves me except for my dogs. I do not break down in the office except when they are actually yelling at me in front of the public, which has happened on multiple occasions).Some months ago I got yelled and screamed at in the office, fingers shoved in my face because I asked one boss a question that my other boss thinks I should have asked her, despite the fact that she was busy at the time.I have been repeatedly given the silent treatment. I ask a question even to a room full of people and everyone makes a point of ignoring me. Sometimes someone will ask the exact same question or make the same point a few seconds after me and they are acknowledged, but again they make a point of ignoring me and only helping that person. Sometimes I’ll even ask for a book or item I need to do my job and it’s like they pretend I don’t even exist.I have heard my boss on multiple occasions talking negatively about me on the phone. I can hear her and there’s no doubt she knows that. She also gossips about my personal life in a deeply humiliating way and yes, I hear that as well. When I’m trying to have a private phone conversation they eavesdrop on me then actually call each other to talk to each other about what I said.One boss seems to think that it’s funny that my partner left me and teased me about it.We got new office chairs last year. Apparently they’re notoriously terrible across the office but I tried to make mine work. It ended up completely destroying my back and I had to WFH for a month or so while I was in the early stages of physical therapy. I was treated like I was a lying pest throughout this period. I couldn’t even stand up and take a deep breath without feeling the most excruciating pain. Apparently when anyone else here ditches the new chairs and deals with crippling back pain, it’s legit, but when I do it I’m just faking and dramatic.A coworker that sits behind me has decided to watch me work and reported back to my boss about everything I’m doing. Rather than tell her to mind her own business and work on her own stuff, my boss took me back to her desk and told me that I was being watched so I’d better be more careful. I’m just trying to do my damn job.I have had papers dramatically ripped away from me after I’ve been shown them. I’ve been told that I’m “making up excuses” for things like doctor appointments and deaths. I got hung up on after I called in to say I’d be late because someone broke into my car and I needed to call the police and take pictures and assess what had been stolen."
My friend isn’t receiving his PTO after quitting when i did.,So like the title says my friend and I both worked at AMC theatres for 3 years and recently we both quit. I happen to quit first and my GM approached me and asked me if I wanted my PTO paid out I said yes so in my last check I got my remaining PTO paid out.Now my friend quit about a month after I did and he emailed them asking if he could also get paid out and the same GM told him that he couldn’t do that due to a policy but he did it for me the month prior and proceeded to send my friend a policy about PTO in NY but it provides information on how sick hours are accrued and how they are used but doesn't place any limitations on being paid out upon leaving the company. And I asked several people who left around the same time I did if they got their PTO paid out and they’ve all said no and that none of them even got asked. So now I have a couple of questions.What would be the PTO payout laws in my state (we live in NY)Are there any AMC rules that say we can’t be paid out once we leave the company. and 3. is there anything legal we could do for our GM playing favorites and only offering me the opportunity to cash out my PTO but making difficult for others to do so?https://www.ny.gov/new-york-paid-sick-leave/new-york-paid-sick-leave and this is the link our GM sent to my friend

Falsification of Property disclosure,"I bought a house in May 22 and there was no indication of basement flooding on the property disclosure. During the inspection, there were indications of basement flooding so I asked explicitly about it and was told it was not a problem. In July, my new neighbors informed me that my basement does flood but the seller had something installed but they didn't think it addressed the problem completely. Last weekend we had heavy rain while I was at work at the fire department for 24 hours. I checked the basement camera and all appeared to be fine. After being home a couple days, I went into the basement and found about 4 inches of standing water. It took hours using a shopvac to empty the water 5 gallons at a time. I'm still sorting out the damage to my personal items. Thankfully most of my stuff was above the water level but there will still be a loss of property and personal, irreplaceable, and collectors items. Do I have any legal right to seek a monetary recompense from the seller at this point?If flooding had been disclosed, I would have gotten flood insurance and certainly not set up the basement as I've had it. I should note that the basement is unfinished."

Can I sue my job,I was recently hired as a key holder at the childrens place. A little bit after I started working my manger started to schedule me against my availability. I went to talk to her about this and she tried to push me out of the postion. One of the issues is I have church on Sunday I told her this during the interview and agreed to work one Sunday a month and occasionally two. She started to schedule me every other Sunday. I asked her to give me sundays off whenever she could and offer to work before and after church some weeks as long as I could just go to church. She started to tell me that I could have off any Sunday I want if I took a lower paying position. The other issue is I’m a cheerleader and wanted off for some of my football games. We also talked about this in the interview. I made it clear that I understand I might not be able to get all of them off and I could work before and after them. She again wouldn’t even agree to try and offered a lower paying postion. I told her to find someone else for the job and then went to her manger. Her boss gave me my job back and told me that me having those days off was no problem and she didn’t understand the issue. After this she did a number of petty things and started scheduling me five days a week. When I was hired she said she would be scheduleing me for longer shifts and less days so I texted her about this asking if possible she could keep her word on this. She never texted me back so I waited for the next schedule to come out. She scheduled me for five days again so I went to talk to her. She told me their was nothing she could do which I know is a lie because I talked to the other part time keyholder before this and she has no problem working more days. She also said I changed my availability which never happen I only held her to the things she told me in the interview. Other associates also told me she made negative comments about me before I was even hired. Do u think I could take any legal action or would I not have enough for a case?
Work violated privacy,"This past weekend I was bitten at work and had to go to the hospital. After the weekend, the office manager (accidentally) texted my mother instead of me asking about the paperwork for the state ( all bites have to be reported). My mother is not my emergency contact, and this also was not an emergency contact situation. I did not tell my mom about the bite or trip to the er as she is already super stressed, and has MS so I absolutely did not want to add to her stress, as stress can cause relapses. And just like I thought, when she received that text she got super worried about me and stressed, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. I realize it varies state to state (I’m in SC), but do I have any legal recourse here at all? I just feel completely violated and quite frankly don’t trust the management at work anymore."

[California] My lease is up and my landlord is not responding about rent.,My landlord recently ended their services with the property group that was handling my rent and managing the property at the beginning of August. The property group let me know that the owner has not given them details on who will manage when their management ends.We reached out to the owner/landlord directly twice now and have not heard back on how we can pay rent for September.Can the landlord evict us? Are we automatically doing month-to-month now?Any advice on what to do is much appreciated!
Help please,"Hi, I live in Illinois and not sure about my rights as a tenant when it comes to obtaining copies of written notices I gave my previous landlords ending my leases. I had signed one 1 year lease (July 2021- July 2022) and gave a 60 day notice saying I wanted to add 1 month and to do a month to month lease once that ended.  First of August I gave another 30 day notice that I wouldn’t be signing for another month. Everything was fine, I had never made a late payment, never late on bills, kept it clean, etc. and two weeks before I moved my landlords informed me that I didn’t give them the 60 day notice and that I am not responsible for full rent for September as well ($825). I told them that I couldn’t afford paying rent in two separate places for one month since I am a single mother and barely making over minimum wage but would be willing to set up some kind of payment plan and that it would be in full. Anytime before this I would get a response within hours and now they won’t respond at all. My grace period ended as well for September and they are now charging me $20 a day until full rent is paid. I’m not sure if I wasn’t clear in the first notice I sent them and they can throw it out and say I only gave them a 30 day notice. But I can’t double check it since they won’t respond or send me a copy. In the lease it states 60 day notice on one page and 30 day notice on a different page. Im not sure where to go from here or what legal room I have. My mother loaned me the money to pay them off today at a total of $885, but neither of us really have the extra money to give them in the first place. They still have my deposit ($775) as well and I highly doubt I’ll get most of that back."

Tire Shop Broke my radiator/transmission and tried to fix it with glue.,"Short Version: While fixing a hole in a tire, a mechanic cracked the radiator and damaged the transmission and tried to fix it with glue.  Later that same week during a pouring rainstorm on a busy highway my car starting pouring out smoke.  The transmission is totaled and frankly I or my four year old son could have been killed.Since the purchase of my car, it has only been to the dealership for all maintenance with one exception.  I have tires replaced at a private family shop.  On Tuesday last week my wife woke with a flat tire. The local tire shop (a small family business out of their house) said they'd be able to fix it.  I picked the car later on that afternoon.  I asked him how much it was? he said it depends how I would pay but cheapest was $20 cash.  So i gave him the cash and he didn't give me a receipt which I thought was strange but he seemed busy and ran out of the room so I didn't press it.  I'm not normally a receipt guy but my wife keeps all the car records in a binder so I know it's important to her thankfully.So the car was driven for a week--no more than 20 minutes at a time, 50 minutes a day--just town driving.  But that following tuesday after the repair, I had to take my four year old son from his MiL to my parents  up north. My wife had become really sick in the night and I was worried about infecting him.  But on the highway--in the rain--there was the smell of something burning.  Thinking that the flat had reappeared I pulled to the side of the road.  But when I got out to inspect the tire I noticed that a cloud of smoke was billowing from the engine.  So i ran over to my sons side of the car, got him out and told him the car could be on fire and we needed to move far away from it.  So we stood in the woods in the rain waiting for my mother to find us and AAA to tow  the car away.The mechanic at the dealership let me know today what happened.  There is a connector between the radiator and the transmission that had been cut off. There was damage to the radiator that someone had tried to patch with glue.  When I asked him if it was something that could have happened in lifting a car or fixing a tire he said it could have.  But he was concerned that the piece hadn't been replaced and the shoddiness of the repair.  The transmission is ruined and further diagnostics are being done to assess additional damage.To me and my wife it seems like an open and shut case.  The car was broken during the ""repair"", the mechanic tried to cover it up quickly, and it could have killed my son or me and it'll cost at least seven grand to repair.Is this the kind of thing that I should bring to a lawyer?  My brother seems to think I should ask the tire guy his side of the story and see if he wouldn't settle out of court.  My opinion is that it was reckless, cowardly, irresponsible and shameful.  I'm not interested in his side because that time has long past.If so, what kind of information should I try to get to help my case? We have service records from the car proving no work to the transmission or radiator were every performed.  The mechanic at the dealership said that the piece was cut off and glue was applied showing that it didn't happen by act of god.  I have text messages discussing the tire plus phone logs to the tire shop.  I'm going to be getting pictures of the damage tomorrow.  What else should I do?"

"(USA) I have 2 valid licenses from 2 different states, what do I do?","So I lived in California for several years, and had a drivers license from this state. I then moved to Oklahoma for work, where I got a new license(I didn’t retake my driving test, I used my CA license as part of the application). I’m now moving back to california, and before I went to apply for a new license it occurred to me that Oklahoma never took my california license away or voided it. So I went on the CA DMV website and requested my driver record to confirm and sure enough my california license is still valid.I still have both cards, and for all intents and purposes both are still active. I did some googling and it seems that having multiple state licenses is in fact illegal. What do I do? Can I just throw away my Oklahoma license and pretend it never happened? Do I have to go reapply in California and pretend that Oklahoma took away my CA license? Could I get in any real trouble for this, besides for having both licenses on my person?"

Handling inheritance on behalf of disabled brother-in-law.,"I have a question about inheritance from my in-laws. My brother in law can’t work due to weekly hospitalization. He receives full disability and Medicare. Due to this, BIL isn’t written into the will due to income caps associated with his disability. They can’t have him lose his insurance as that would cost more in the long run than his inheritance is worth.The will is written so that my wife will be given his portion of the inheritance with the expectation that we gift him cash “under the table” to enable him to enjoy his inheritance while continuing to receive his dole and insurance.I would much prefer to set up a special needs trust for the BIL to avoid any potential legal consequences.What is the legality of this situation?"
Real Estate Law Question,"TLDR; Can I give tenants the option to make a new lease agreement at more than a 10% rental fee increase if they consent to the increase?Quick question. I have tenants living in my apartment. It’s California and under rent control. They had a lease but it expired and have been under month to month at will tenancy for over a year. They want to stay, but I need to move back in because my personal cost of living went up due to medical expenses. I want to find a new place for myself but can’t find anything affordable. So I’m looking out of state. But in the meantime, it looks like I will need to live in the apartment for a few months at least.My question is this, I don’t make money on the apartment. And they want to stay. Everything comparable today is almost double in rent. Can I even offer them a chance to just pay a few hundred more and then they can stay and make a new lease? It’s just that it would be against rent control law because the increase would be more than 10%. But them getting a new apartment will be like an 80% increase. Can I at least ask?"
"I now am well aware that a past smartphone of mine was extracted and doxxed, I suspect by the Police.","For reference I'm in the UK. It became apparent to me earlier this year that some very private data of mine had become open knowledge and my family and neighbours and a lot more people besides had learned things about me I had wanted to keep to myself. Suffice to say I felt pretty violated by that and it evoked strong reactions and hate towards me. I stress that it was obviously nothing illegal but it was NSFW.I believe a past smartphone was extracted following a police report I submitted for harrassment in 2018 and the phone may have been tapped. I believe I was suspected of criminal activity but this was false. Subsequently this private data which had been extracted and retained by police was leaked. Not sure when it was leaked or how long it took to spread. I've moved twice since and over some distance but unfortunately for me this data leak has caught up with me.I'm wondering if anyone here understands what possibly went off more so that I do and if you know what can be done about mismanagement of personal data by the police. I'm worried that this being an inside data breach and an embarrassing one at that, that the police themselves aren't going to help me out. They don't seem very professional with these powers they've been given.Note: I was recommended to post here from r/privacy."

"boyfriends car got repossessed, what do",So my boyfriends car just got repossessed a few hours ago because he's behind on two payments again. I caught him up on 3 payments not too long ago and now they did this. We were going to take the car back to CarMax to sell this weekend since we honestly barely use it and we were going to start car living in my car and give his up. The timing of it all really sucks. I told him to call the bank and see where it's at first thing tomorrow morning so we can figure this out. Is there anything else I need to do? Will we have issues selling the car back to CarMax at all? He just can't keep up with the payments anymore and is overall done with the car. Thanks all.

Warranty rights under Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act - When can I request a refund instead of another repair?,"I bought an MSI laptop that's a lemon. It was overheating and crashing for months, so I sent it in for RMA. They misdiagnosed the issue and sent it back still broken, so I sent it in for a 2nd RMA, got it back again and it's still not fixed. It's only halfway through its warranty. I no longer want this computer, and as I understand it, after a certain point (maybe # of repair attempts?), the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act requires the warranty issuer to replace or refund the product at the customer's discretion. I'm unable to find the answer online; when am I within my rights to demand a refund under this Act?"
Being incorrectly charged for electricity; Company non-responsive,"I recently signed up with a new electric provider (Texas) and they are incorrectly charging me.I was supposed to receive free energy between 8pm and 5:59am every day. I am being charged for, and their online portal shows, that I am only receiving free energy until 4:59am every day.I have called several times and emailed their help line with proof. It's been about three weeks. My question is, what recourse do I have? I'm sure if I cancel they will still charge the fee, and if I don't pay that'll obviously hit my credit.How long do I wait this out until it's fixed, and if they do not fix it, what can I do?Note that I have an EFL statement from them when I created the account showing when and how I should be charged. I am also able to pull raw numbers from their website that clearly show the error as well.Thanks for any help!"

"Do homeowners typically have the right to exclude you from parking in on the side of the road in front of their property, in a residential area, with no signs about parking and unlimited parking spaces?","A couple times now we've been hassled for parking on the side of the road to go for a 20 minute dog walk in various residential areas in the town where we reside.These are somewhat rural residential areas where there are no signs about parking and where hardly anyone ever parks on the road, everyone parks in their driveways so there is unlimited space to park on the road and we're not blocking anyone's parking spot.We try to avoid parking in front of someone's house in a provocative way, but the side of the road is always next to someone's property and some times the property owner comes out and yells at us for ""being on their property"", even though we're nowhere near their house or driveway and are just pulled over on the shoulder normally.As far as I know, we're not on their property, we're just on the side of the road, which is part of the public right of way or whatever.Once a homeowner does this we avoid that area, but I just want be sure that these people are wrong, because it feels like inevitably in the future some new bored homeowner will take upon himself to hassle us for parking for 20 minutes.And no, we're not doing anything scary, we're not even young people, one of the people walking is an elderly woman."
Can I withdraw my interview contribution from a podcast?,"So I was asked for an interview in a podcast. After having had the interview this afternoon, after about an hour of speaking, the conversation became very negative and annoying. At first I was put at ease by talking about myself, and at the end it turned out that I was actually asked because a prize I won was, according to the podcast editors, of no value. I was questioned as if I were the scammer and fished for quotes that I felt would be used out of context.I immediately emailed when I got home that I don't want my contribution to the podcast to be used and I don't want anything to do with it. How strong am I in this case? I haven't signed any agreement. Only on the mail agreed that I would come for the interview. Nowhere in the e-mails can I read that I would be confronted as if I were a scammer. (While at most I would be a victim of fraud in this case if it's true the podcast makers said)"
I am considering quitting my job due to a hostile work environment. What are my chances?,"Do I have any chance of getting unemployment under these circumstances? I need some income until I find another job, but I don’t know how much more I can handle of this. I’m in Missouri. It absolutely is a hostile environment. I have had:Fingers pointed in my face while my boss screamed at me in full view of the public, for talking to another, higher boss about a work-related question while at work when she was busyHours or days in which I’m subjected to the “silent treatment”, up to the point where if I even speak out loud, not one person will answer me and they will talk over me as though I am not there - this is a very small, open-plan office and it’s impossible for them to not hear me; there’s a very high-school clique-ish atmosphere, you’re either in or you’re out and it all depends on whether or not someone in the clique likes you or doesn’t like youWhispered conversations I’ve overheard, in which my colleagues are talking about me disparagingly and in a mocking, immature wayFits of castigation that go on for fifteen minutes or more, in which I am berated for not coming into work sick, or after a serious family problem or emergencyTwo separate incidents in which I was sexually harassed by people who came into the office, both of which my immediate bosses couldn’t understand why I was making a big deal out of it; the first time they denied it had ever happened, despite my material proof, and the second time (also with material proof) I apparently was supposed to take it as a compliment. After the first incident, once I escalated it to a higher boss, he also denied that any harassment was taking place and that I was somehow misinterpreting it (I had been sent personal notes and cards from this person, a former politician that the office was familiar with, and besides that, he singled me out for this and never sent any such correspondence to anyone else there, so their argument that this was normal behavior was not valid), but assured me that if I was uncomfortable, I would no longer have to speak with him. My immediate bosses were aware of this. Not two weeks after this, he asked for me specifically on the phone and they transferred him to me without even mentioning who it was, or if I was okay with speaking with him.Papers ripped away from me in a dramatic fashion because I’ve yet again made someone angry by missing work due to sickness, family issues, or an emergencyCalls in which I was deliberately hung up on in disgust when I called to say I’d be late because my car was broken into and I had to contact the police and clean upAccounts of exactly what I’ve been doing at my desk reported back to me, because one of my colleagues (not a superior) sits behind me and has been closely watching me, and continues to do so - I am not doing anything strange, or different from anyone else, but she just feels the need to watch me and report everything I do back to my boss as though I’m doing something wrong - I’m not, but it puts me on edge since now I literally don’t know what I’m doing “wrong”I’ve also been subjected to loud, in-office discussions about how women who report rape or assault years after the fact are just lying for money - which make me seriously uncomfortable (I was raped at 18 and was just too scared to tell anyone); been told by my boss that “the CDC says COVID is officially over” and other anti-masking, anti-vaccine claims; and been given condescending “advice” on how I and the person I’m sharing my life with have wrong political and social opinions."
What to do after realizing we were scammed 1000’s of dollars from a local company,"This take place in SOCal Orange County USA. About 7 months ago my wife found a SPA based out of the owners home and used them. She loved them and they’re service, and used them for about 4 months on a biweekly basis. She was than asked by the owner her self if instead of paying every time she visitited, if she’d like to buy a package for multiple visits and save some money. It’s important to know my wife is Chinese and in this community there is undisputed high trust and dealing with others from within your clique. So while she would never usually do this my wife agreed and spent 2k$ on a half years worth of spa treatments. Well Monday rolls around my wife can’t contact the woman or the business, and all of they’re social media is gone. She than contacts an employee who is really upset, the employee tells my wife that the week prior, she gave the shop owner 20k for helping with the business, as they’ve worked together for years and, as soon as she sent it all of the business contacts shut down.We found 17 other customers through my wife’s social media who all had 1k+ packages, and now they’re looking for what to do.Please let me know and what the best route is. We called local law enforcement and we’re told that there’s nothing they can do."
Question about spousal maintenance in Colorado,"I have been married to my wife for 11 years. She now wants a divorce out of a combination of ""loss of love"", mid-life crisis, and emotional affair (not that the reasons matter in Colorado).Up until March 2021, I had been the primary breadwinner up until that point, though my wife periodically also held lower-paying jobs to help supplement our income. By March 2021, my income was approximately $98,000/yr. In the two years leading up to that point, she had taken a much more active role in developing a career, including us paying for multiple trainings and certifications, etc. For a time she held two ""full-time"" WFH jobs to maximize her income and experience. In March 2021, she was recruited by a startup in her field for a position much higher than her current one, with lots of growth potential, and double my income. This job would require her to focus on it exclusively for probably 12-14 hours a day, I had been fighting with my boss (the CEO of my then-current employer) and, talking about working on a side-project business, etc. The convenience of the increased income, the need for me to take care of the kids and the house, and the opportunity to spend more time on my side-project made for a great opportunity.In April of 2022, my wife went through an executive coaching program that cost $10,000.  She now tells me that that program made her realize she wanted a divorce, but that she had to think about it until now. Now she wants a divorce, and thinks that she does not have to pay spousal maintenance to me, even though I quit my career to support hers, take care of the kids, etc. Yes, it was convenient for me at the time, but that only worked when I thought we were working together toward a common goal.She says an attorney she talked to said that she did not have to pay spousal maintenance since I could get a job. Setting aside the fact that my side-project is now at the point that within the next six months we should have major pre-seed venture capital, and I have to abandon all that if I went back to work, the attorney I spoke to said that she would have to pay spousal maintenance, since I quit my job to support hers, notwithstanding the additional benefit I got of not having to deal with my boss any more or being able to work on my side-project.A couple of weeks ago she told me that I wouldn't have to worry about spousal maintenance, which I assumed meant that she was just going to go with the formula. However, tonight she said something about how she was volunteering to support me, and that I should be more helpful with the divorce process (I'm not impeding, I'm just not shouldering any of the work of the divorce - she wants it, not me). I told her that was generous, but that she had to pay spousal maintenance anyway, whether or not I do all the work of processing the divorce. That's when it came out that it was her impression that she did not have to because I had the ability to get a job.Is anyone familiar with Colorado divorce law who can help clarify this for me please?"
Inheritance question - NC USA,"My question is about who inherits a house (or money from the sale) when most of a direct family has passed away.  Jurisdiction is NC.My mother's second cousin (34M) passed away two weeks ago.  Let’s call him Joe Jr.  Joe Jr. was the only child of Joe Sr. and his mother passed away several years ago and his father, Joe Sr. passed last year.  A complicating factor is the family home was still in the name of Joe Sr’s estate and was in the process of being sold, so nothing is in Joe Jr.’s name.Another complicating factor is that Joe Jr.’s mother had a child out of wedlock (not Joe Sr.’s) that she gave up for adoption before meeting Joe Sr. and having Joe Jr., we’ll call him Tim.  Tim recently came back into Joe Jr.’s life before Joe Jr. died and as a brother has taken charge over over the affairs of his burial and Joe Sr.s estate.My question is this - would Tim be the closest relative and have claim to Joe Sr.’s estate given that he is not directly related to Joe Sr.?  Would my mom as 1st cousin once removed to Joe Sr. (second cousin to Joe Jr.) have any claim?"

Acquaintance of mine has been in jail for >10 days and does not even have a bond for a Violation of Probation. No other information on the arrest. How does something like this work?,"Background- This person was on probation for DUI. That is all I know.I just have so many questions...When the heck is he going to be out of jail? Does this depend on the severity of his probation violation?Does this mean that he's just going to jail for the initial term of his DUI arrest without any chance to fight in court since he violated probation?The ONLY charge I see is ""Violation of Probation"". Does this mean that whatever he did to violate probation was not a crime for a person not on probation? For example, if he assaulted somebody wouldn't it show one charge for assault and another for VOP?Like I said in the title...he's been in jail for over 10 days! Is this normal for a VOP? Or does this also depend on the severity of his initial charge and/or probation violation?"
AZ Tenant Question,"On July 6th, my roommate, who was on the lease, came home at 4 am obviously in a drug fueled psychosis. I told him to leave. He had not paid his half of rent or utilities. It was due on July 1. He called the rental agency to remove himself from the lease but did not sign the form or provide the $150 admin fee to remove himself. On July 14th, after not seeing him or hearing from him I sent him this message. ""(Roommate), this is an official request for you to pay your portion of utilities, rent and the fee associated with taking you off the lease.

After the 120 hours are up I have no other choice than to consider any property you have left behind abandoned. If ALL of your property has not been picked up by then. I will have to consider that the property has been forfeited to help recover the costs of your unannounced vacation of contract. I need to replenish the amount that has been forced upon me with your abandonment. It is now 11:36 a.m. on July 14th 2022 this is my first notice.

Attractive nuisance: What are “reasonable” measures?,"I’m in Missouri. This was brought up again today in my life, and while I don’t have to really worry about it myself (I don’t think so, anyway), I’m still curious.As an example, I work in real estate records. A woman once called our office demanding to know the owner of a particular old school building slated for redevelopment. Her 14-year-old daughter had decided to break in with her friends, and had pulled a nearby dumpster over to the fence so she and her friends could climb over it, then broke inside (I’m not sure if they busted down a door or broke a window) and then managed to climb to the roof and stand on top of one of the external pilasters on the facade, subsequently falling down and “cracking her skull.” The mother intended to sue the owners.Now, the building was locked and fully fenced; I’ve driven past it before multiple times. Would the owners still be liable if the 14-year-old pulled over another object to scale the fence and get inside? If the doors and windows were locked, and she broke one to get in?What if the child were younger - say, 9 or 10, or even younger than that. Would the owners be liable for failing to take into consideration that a child could climb the fence if they had enough objects to use as steps, and if, say, the fence was crossed in that way, and then the child got hurt attempting to crawl through a broken window?What if the child was 6 or 7, but was accompanied by a teenager, who assisted the child in getting over the fence and breaking into the building, and the younger child was hurt or killed afterwards whilst on the property?Does it matter if an “attractive nuisance’s” fence is secured by a regular padlock or a more advanced alarm system? Or if, say, a chain-link fence was on a property, a third party damaged it (such as by striking it with a vehicle, opening a hole) and a child crawled through that hole? How soon would a property owner be required to fix the problem? Or would it be argued that the property owner should have taken the possibility of the fence getting damaged into consideration in the first place, and thus they are still completely liable, since they did not take measures to ensure the security on the property in the event of such damage?Lastly, how is an “attractive nuisance” determined? Is the building described above an attractive nuisance? An appliance left out for trash pickup? A car parked in a driveway that the owner is repairing? An open garage?"
T1 Diabetic denied entry into his own home to retrieve his medicine,"My partner and I moved into an apartment together 4 years ago. Both our names are on the lease. We have since been going through a very rough patch and have broken up. There was an agreement to split the time in the apartment until we could figure out the best way to handle this situation.I had left for 3 days and stayed with friends and family, when I returned to my apartment during a time I believed my ex to be at work, I discovered my front door’s locks had been changed. I knocked and was then told by his mother who was inside yelling at me that I would be denied entry until I spoke with my ex. I am a T1 diabetic and all my insulin and medical supplies were inside. When I pointed this out to his mother, saying she could not deny me entrance into my own home to gather my medicine, she told me my name was taken off the lease (not true), and this wasn’t my home anymore.I walked away and began to call the police. When they arrived my ex’s mother told them I threatened her and filed a false report to that effect. The police were able to retrieve my medicine for me, but I was still not allowed into my own apartment (they wouldn’t even let me see my dogs).I am only on here because my ex then texted me later saying, if I ever do anything shady to his family again he was going to contact his aunt’s lawyers. That’s the only reason I am writing this post today. Do I have any grounds for legal action here?"

Water Damage from Neighbor,"In US, in state of Ohio....  On the edges of a small city, there is a road that goes down a pretty sharp hill.  There are 5 houses along one side of this road, and they are approximately 125 feet away from each other.  The 2nd house along the road belongs to my parents.  The first house (at the top of the hill) has their rain gutters going to the middle of their property, along the bottom edge of the property.  In short, whenever it rains, the water starts flooding right against my parents property.  My parent's house is probably 10 feet from the property line, and is starting to see water issues.  Dirt is being washed away from the side of their house, and dirt is being washed away from under their driveway.They have talked to the neighbor, and he refuses to direct the water to the street, or anywhere else.  Is there anything they can do to force the neighbor to change where he is directly his rain gutters?"
Nmom excludes me from will secretly,"From the UK.

ELI5 - Why do Asylum Seekers Appear to Get Expedited Entry into a Country compared with Individuals Who try Legal Immigration Procedures?,
How do search warrants work?,"I’ve tried to do my own research, but I can’t find a specific conclusive answer.My question is this:If evidence of a crime (unrelated to the reason for a specific search warrant) is found during the execution of said search warrant, can that be used as evidence in support of additional charges?Say the police or feds search someone’s home for evidence specifically regarding an embezzlement investigation, and in the search they find 5 pounds of marijuana (which happens to be illegal in that state).What happens?  Does the suspect get charged with both crimes, if sufficient evidence was found for both crimes?  If no evidence was found for the original investigation, will they still be charged with the drug crime?For some reason I think that any admissible evidence obtained during a search warrant has to be related to the scope of the suspected crime stated in the warrant.  But I can’t find anything that specifically states that this is true."
is it legal in the state of Florida to reset a students classes? even if it means erasing the progress they already have completed??,"Context: I'm a now senior in an ALS (Alternative Learning Solutions) that's a charter school in the state of Florida, I decided to go to this school after my poor mental health has been ruining me from my 9th grade year to 11th grade year, and with covid happening in when I was in 9th grade and my poor mental health, I decided to go to this ALS charter school to try and get schooling done so I can actually get a highschool diploma instead of GED.I'm a student who has already completed two semesters worth of work plus some from said school to make up credits BEFORE summer started. Well summer ended yesterday, just today I went back to school and had new teachers which is alright, however I'm pretty sure due to the fact that B.E.S.T (Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking Standards) replaced the standard common core in the state of Florida, the teachers mentioned that the math and english curriculum will be updated in the following year/week/month (honestly forgot the timeframe) and then proceeded to mention that classes would need to be reset. Which I felt like there was no need to reset the classes but obviously kept my mouth shut because it's school, then my teacher started going through the list of students who needed to be reset and then mentioned my name, at which that point I wasn't having it and printed out all my current progress in each of my classes, each quiz and lesson I have done, my graduation plan, the credits I have, my test scores and so on and so forth.

What’s the likelihood of me qualifying for state insurance under the guise of disability?,"Before anyone comes after me, let me say this. I am employed, going to school, and trying to help out my newly divorced father with living expenses.

I live in the state of Oklahoma and have been enrolled in the soonercare program since I was an infant.

I was discharged over a year ago. -I am yet to seek out an actual diagnosis due to medical gaslighting and not being taken seriously by medical professionals.

Requesting Fence Extension. What is “hardship”?,"For reference, I live in KS. We are going to present to our local city zoning board about extending our fence, which is already there and built to code, another 18 feet. This would put us one foot inside of our property line. The problem is that we are on a corner lot and there are ordinances around this. The city has accepted our appeal and votes tomorrow, but has some questions for us. I can see their notes, besides the design (standard see-through black aluminum fence), they question if their a hardship? To pass, we have to prove that a hardship exists. The fence is 62 feet long, so extra 18x62 feet is 1116 square feet of additional backyard that we could utilize as “backyard” for our dog and kids that we cannot now. However, I am not sure that extra area classifies as a hardship. Does anyone have any insight as to what is a “hardship” as it relates to property boundaries and how I could spin this tomorrow?TIA"

How long is an officer able to go without filing a police report?,"For reference I live in Wisconsin.The event took place back in April. A police officer was sent to me out for risk of a school shooting or Bomb threat. Realistically, my employer was swatting me because they knew I was triggered by police because of PTSD.On June 29, I asked for a copy of any and all information associated with me, and that specific officer on that date in April. Because the police report would have been about me, I would’ve been entitled to see it. Not only that during the interaction I disclosed the child abuse my employer does. It was a police officer, that would’ve been documentable information. The message I got from the public records department was that there was no information related to my request, including a police report. I spoke with one of the officers colleagues, and he called the officer personally and we found out that it was a welfare check, something I didn’t know where perceive was happening, and that it was a non-documentable event.I filed a complaint against my employer with the state of Wisconsin, and suddenly there is a police report that my employer was able to obtain. however in June, when I made a request to see that sort of information, the public records department acknowledges that there is no  document, and I have a police officer on record stating that it was not documentable event.Something sounds really fishy, because the officers report does not sound or look anything like the conversation we had. and based off the public records department as well as statements from another officer, there should be nothing on the event. But somehow after June, there is some thing on the event.I don’t know what to do, and if there’s a police report being made almost 2 1/2 months after the event, I don’t know if I can trust its validity."
Any actual legal repercussions for lying on a resume? Other than just being terminated?,"Obviously I’m not talking about saying I went to med school or anything, but just making up experience and fudging the numbers a bit. If I say they can’t contact my employer then I’m assuming they won’t find out? And if they do, what’s the worst than can happen? Fraud?"
Questions about obtaining child abandonment,"There is a lot to unfold here so sorry if I seem like I am jumping around with the question. Firstly I live in Florida, I had a lengthy divorce with an excellent attorney. After 2 and a half years of waiting, Feb of 2020, I won sole custody of my children (currently 8 and 5 years old). My Ex-wife suffers from a series of major psychological issues and she was supposed to be evaluated by court order, but that never happened. Since then their mother (who is homeless and jobless) was in the picture every other weekend for about a year and stayed with her parents the weekends she had them.This year my children go to her parent's house and she is not there. Her parents who are 100% supportive of me and on my side of the situation, have told me that she has not seen or taken care of her kids for this year (2022). She no longer comes over to the house, and she has no contact with them or me. This includes the app Talking Parents.From what her parents tell me, is that she is out with a guy who is a commercial trucker and is traveling the country with him. Regardless, her whereabouts are unknown. I just want to have her parental rights removed. So she cannot arrive at my kid's school and take off with them. Her parents and I are worried that she might arrive one day and leave with them to wherever, My children are aware that they should not leave with their mother alone, but I can only trust so much that the school or daycare will not release them with her.  It would be easier if I have a note from the judge or state saying her parental rights have been removed, and the school has possession of this information.Some might tell me to hire my attorney from my divorce. I will if I have too, but I feel that I can do this on my own with her parents as witnesses, who are willing to testify against her. If there are forms I can fill them out or call whomever to start the process.(TL:DR)Basically, I just was curious if there is anyone familiar with FL law and how to have parental rights removed due to abandonment, and how to go about it.Thanks!"
"Given the Brittney Griner situation, what kind of a punishment could a foreign national expect for bringing cannabis into the US?","I realize this is a somewhat vague question, since it would depend on the amount of weed, as well as various other circumstances.  I am interested in precedents.  No doubt, there must have been Canadian or Mexican nationals (where cannabis is legal to various degrees)  who have been caught with cannabis on the US border.  What kinds of punishments were meted out by the American justice system in these instances?"

Denied job due to surgery.,"Is this discrimination? Getting surgery for something that basically makes me disabled in September, went through a multi week hiring process just for them to say “oh I see your getting surgery, sorry we’re no longer going with you”Like, that feels like discrimination, if it happened to a pregnant chick it would be, but since I’m just broken I don’t know?"
Is it blackmail or extortion if I offer not to report a crime provided they pay back money I previously lent them?,"Long and convoluted story, I’ll try and spark notes it as best I can.We were friends and roommates in CA. He fell on hard times, and I started helping him out financially (was kind of forced to as he stopped paying his half of the rent) provided he paid me back. For a while, he was paying me back on a regular basis.Then we had an argument, and he stopped both paying me back and speaking to me. The living situation was extremely contentious, so I spoke to the landlord and they let me out of the lease and I moved out on my own. I tried to pursue a small claims against him for the money owed (I have texts etc that confirm I lent him money and he had agreed to pay it back) but it became too difficult to serve him when I didn’t know where he was living and talking to an attorney the amount it would have cost me to hire someone wouldn’t have netted me that much even if we won (the original amount was about $20k, he paid back about half so he still owes ~10k). Eventually, I gave up and moved on.Fast forward like 3 years, I now live in New York and was checking my credit and found a soft inquiry for what looks like an apartment rental application in Texas (which is where we met as colleagues, though we both left in ~2016 to move to CA). So it looks like he may have forged my signature to co-sign his rental application.My thought process is to reach out to him, confirm that he actually did use my signature, and remind him that he still owes me 10k and that forgery is a crime. If he resumes paying me what I lent him, and promises never to use my name like that again, I won’t report the forgery as a crime.Obviously, IANAL so the quid pro quo part of it makes me uncomfortable that it could be considered blackmail or extortion. Am I potentially putting myself in hot water by offering not to report the crime if he pays me back what I lent him?Thanks"
I rear ended someone,"Hi thereI rear ended someone more than a year ago.I was at a safe following distance, going through a national road, she claimed a truck wanted to merge with her lane (no indicators used by the truck, that stayed in its lane).She continued to decelerate completely, with no swerving lane (two lanes) it was either I brake into the trucks rear or the lady braking infront of me.Happend in about a few seconds.She didn't use her hazards when stopping, and her brake lights was not operational.After the fact she verbally assaulted me, without a mask, in covid restrictions, pointing her finger derectly in my face.My police report reflects this as well.A year after the fact a branch or subsidiary of her insurance company is (probably) going to try and sue me.A letter of demand was forwarded to me over Whatsapp (not email), I stated to the lady forwarding the documents to stop harassing me, and if it were to continue I would get a interdict."
Would this be destroying evidence?,"Let's say a person is driving and commits some driving violation while they have a dash cam and get pulled over by a police officer. During the traffic stop, the police officer does everything correctly, and in the course of questioning the driver, the driver willingly admits to the crime.Now let's say the only hard evidence of the admission is the dash cam footage from the camera owned by the driver, and in the court case concerning the event the prosecutors become aware of the fact that defendant admitted guilt and that the dash cam footage he owns. The prosecutors became aware of this through legal means and obtain a warrant to access that footage and use it as evidence in court.In each of these scenarios, please give your thoughts as it pertains to destroying evidence or obstructing justice:Before the warrant is issued, the defendant irretrievably deletes the footage but had no idea that it might be requested as evidence in the trial.Before the warrant was issued, the defendant irretrievably deletes the footage because he knows it could be used against him in court.The defendant heard about the warrant and irretrievably deletes the footage.For the next couple of scenarios, let's say this is the case: the defendant's camera is set up such that it would automatically and irretrievably delete the footage after a certain time had elapsed unless he specifically chose to have certain footage permanently saved. By the time the warrant to retrieve the footage was obtained, the automatic deletion of the footage had already taken place.Please give your thoughts like before in these scenarios:The dash camera set up is as it came from the manufacturer, and he was oblivious to how it might effect legal proceedings, and the manufacturer made that the default setting for the camera with the intention to just make economic use of data storage space without regard to how that might effect legal proceedings.The same as above, but the manufacturer specifically advertises the camera as performing this function so that no evidence against you will be accessible."

"Workers Comp: Not receiving the care I need, and I'm being told to find a new job","I am a Michigan resident.TL;DR Context: I work for a good company, and my workers comp experience so far has been good. However, I've been dropped by my original pain management team. I was advised to follow up with my PCP, who is refusing to work with me and only gave me one month of restrictions before releasing me back to work with zero restrictions. My condition does not require surgery and I have the ability to heal. My workers comp case worker, and PCP doctor are suggesting I get a new job because it sounds like my condition ""may be permanent."" This is not case because I haven't had a re-evaluation yet to prove this true. My pain managment appointments are months apart, and most of my process has been spent waiting around.Full Story:I am female, 26 years old and I've been off work since February 1st (currently August 2nd)My lumbar is inflamed/dammaged from a work place injury. I am a stocker and forklift driver, so intense physical labor is required at my job. I can not bend, twist, or walk for long periods without being in pain. The pain is enough to prevent me from most activities. I've been doing this job for 7 years.Originally worked with an Orthopedic Spine Surgeons office for MRI Scans, and a referral for physical therapy.I was in physical therapy for about 1.5 - 2 months before she dropped me because ""I was too strong for PT and there was nothing more she could do."" It's true, I'm a physically fit person who was actively lifting weights SAFELY at the gym. My weight lifting truely is unrelated to my injury.My MRI showed an injury and I was sent to an injection specialist for steroid shots.Shots are 1 month to several months apart.my spine surgeon doctor had to drop me because my condition does not require surgery. He did what he could, but he reccomended that I see my PCP for future follow ups. He said he would even speak with my doctor directly to explain the situation."

Horrible apartment management making life difficult,"I would like to first mention that the problems I have with the management would seem too bad, but it's frustrating and I need a solution to work this out. I live in US for your reference.I moved onto a new place around March. Ever since I moved in they are having elevator issue on a weekly basis. I am a mechanical engineer and understand things break but how hard would it be to get an elevator fixed that could last for more than a week. This is especially an issue for me as I stay at the top floor and coming back home after a tiring day is just physically and mentally draining as there is only one elevator.The management are, first, not acknowledging that this is an issue. They are saying it's not an repetitive issue which it clearly is and say they will consider changing the elevator if it has reached it's end of life.Their maintenance on other stuff is also pretty bad. They have an approach of I would get it to when I get to it and is frankly annoying. Simple stuff like repairing common area lock itself was delayed for months. When questioned about it, I got a response of 'Sorry we can't match your level of standards ' in a very sarcastic manner.I need to know if there is any law that can either force them to fix the problem or help me break the lease without costing an arm and a leg (I live in a nice area so breaking the lease is pretty expensive)Thank you in advanced for your help."
Debt collectors on fraudulent checks,"Long story, basics:lost wallet (including ID, credit cards, and checks), cancelled CC's and forgot about checks, last year.Someone found the wallet and starting a spending spree, we caught it with about $1000 dollars and stopped activities on the account.We filed a police report within the week of us noticing, closed the account, and opened a new one.We got a collection letter last month, we filled out their online form to dispute and included the case # along with the officer's email address.  Since the account is closed we do not have easy information on the exact check #'s (I do not use checks, I have written literally 1 in the last 2 years.)They sent another collection, for a different check, same process.We now are receiving bills from them.  My spouse thinks she may have missed some things on the form.  What should we do?  (Or how hosed are we?)  We do have the money, and each is over $500."
"Mother Passed, Brother Took the House [Michigan]","Anon, obviously. My mother passed (and my father about 1 year before). She did not have a will.  My brother was so uninvolved in her care, that doctors and nurses thought I was an only child.After her passing, I was still living in her home because I had been taking care of her 24/7. Then he moved in.  He brought his child and the child's mother.  It became apparent, after over hearing conversations, that he didn't want me there.After his steady diet of 8AM weed and noon o'clock beer, he kicked me out. He seems to think he has authority because he is older than me, his sister, by 18 months.So, what legal recourse do I have here? The house and contents should be split 50/50? What happens with the house? It's worth like $300k. And most of my belongings are still there as well.Please help me get started to get my life back (I've had to move in with an abusive boyfriend)."
Mortgages and Tax Deed Sale,"I have been having difficulty finding out whether or not a mortgage on a property prevails after a tax deed sale conducted by a county. (Specifically New York). I see online some websites briefly mention it but I like to get some more insight into how the mortgages usually get ""wiped out"", if they do at all."
[WA] At what point should I assume my lawyer is padding the bill,"I have a contract dispute, and I'm very concerned that the lawyer I have hired is ripping me off.  The case itself should be very simple.  Guy (located in Ohio) owes me money, had signed a contract, accepted the final product, made several promises to pay me, never did.  All of this backed up with emails and text messages.The lawyer had several phone calls with the guy, and filed a 10 page complaint filed in Washington district federal court, and had him served.  The businessman never responded to the lawsuit, and so I should be able to get a default judgement, but the lawyer is ready to drop it all together.  This is for a couple reasons,a) the guy is probably judgement proof, he has his companies set up in such a way to make himself immune from any lawsuits (which is probably why he never bothered responding).b) the cost of just filing has drained me of resources.  The work I did for him represents all the money I made last year, and he owes me around $100k.  The lawsuit itself also specifies other damages for unconscionable acts for $1m, plus there is the promise of stock, which he himself had put a value on of another $1m.  Then there is another stock he promised me which never fulfilled.So, I gave the lawyer a total of $7k so far.  Due to some personal issues, the lawyer wasted a lot of time by letting the case sit for months, then going over all the facts a couple times to learn about it again.  So far, he only sent me 1 invoice for $2600, but also includes time written off in the amount of $7,651.  He loves to mention how he did that, but again wasted time was a good amount of that.  So, a total invoice of over $10k.Since then, I have never received another invoice.  He has told me he needs more money, but has never provided me an invoice, even though I have asked.  He finally responded to an email this morning after a week, and told me he will put together an invoice, but it'll be a charge and we can talk about what I'd be willing and able to pay for.Thing is, that first invoice included 2 hours of work on the complaint, and all that has been accomplished since then is finishing the complaint, filing, and serving.  So he would have had to spend about 10 more hours on the 10 page complaint to even have used all the retainer money I sent him.  All together, he claims to have spent $15k+ worth of time just to file a complaint.  No discovery, no depositions, no court days.My case is going to die without even a default judgement because I can't send him more money.  If this is legit, then legal recourse is really out of the realm of normal people.Edit: As a side note, this has really bugged me.  Early on in the discussion, the businessman offered my lawyer a job.  The lawyer disclosed this to me, but he didn't flat out turn it down.  He told me that he was always open to job offers, but we'd have to resolve this case first.  I can't imagine he would screw me over for a potential job with a guy who is clearly a scammer, but it has stuck with me, and there is a part of me which wonders."

Can I sue JUUL?,"I started using that as a never smoker before. Used for one and a half months and it damaged my tonsil and made it become chronically inflamed and because of that, it gave me a horrible dry mouth and now I’m suffering with dental and gum damage after 3 years of having this. Getting my tonsils taken out next month but this journey has been so awful. I’ve thought about ending my life because of the pain of this and I now have pretty bad depression because of this. It really affected my life and I’m certain using this device caused it. I remember the day this started clearly. It’s like my Indio had enough and felt hot all of a sudden and too much nicotine caused it to become dry and irritated or something and it must have burned or irritated my left tonsil because I used it in my left side and the inflammation of that tonsil caused altered saliva flow and made my mouth incredibly dry and painful for years. It took me a long time to find doctors in my area and get real answers and even now no one is sure of what happened but I remember the thing just damaged that tonsil and made it become bad. I’ve suffered from like 5 cases of tonsillitis since this and have never had that before in my life. Just looking at my gum damage makes me so sad and depressed."
I don’t know what to say to a doctor about something that happened during surgery or if this is against a legal policy,"So today I went in to get my wisdom teeth removed as one does. I have had many surgeries much longer than this one and much more intense. The last surgery apart from this one I had I got an infection afterwards and my life was put on hold for about 6 months. Afterwards I have been really apprehensive about any form of doctors. I had to go to the dentist and I thought I found a really amazing practice. They had great reviews, understood my past surgeries, and seemed very sweet.Well today was the day of my wisdom teeth surgery. I discussed the procedure with the dentist again and the nurse making sure to emphasize that I would be put under and that I’ve done it a few times before. Well I didn’t even know this could happen but I woke up around 10-15 minutes before the surgery was over ( this was supposed to be a 30-45 minute surgery) and I was trying to tell the dentist and the nurse there. He told me to be quiet and stop crying. I could feel the surgery happening in my mouth and started crying and freaking out immediately. He just did not seem to care at all. He then left the room and my mom came it to get ready to take me home (you can’t drive yourself after). They had to hold me extra because my heart rate and blood pressure were so high trying to ask the nurse why he did that and telling my mom what had happened. I have to say I was freaking out and everyone in the room and near it could hear me. The doctor came back in the room and said something along the lines of “I’m sure I’m going to hear from you tomorrow/ get a call tomorrow”.I want to call tomorrow but I have no idea what to say. I am really scared of this man now and just writing this I am crying. I also felt like he didn’t even care about what happened when I was in a lot of pain.What do I say? How should I handle this?I was pointed to this discussion after a sub to ask doctors advice about this situation."
Software License Mechanism captured my email traffic,"I'm currently in negotiations with a software company that has accused me of using an unlicensed copy.

Fired because I wouldn't work for free?,"Location: USA, New JerseyI'll keep this brief. I worked two seperate jobs for a company.

Typical customer service work.At no point was I told that my willingness to do one job impacted my employment for the other.Recently, they began to ask me to start working on a software project, but said they couldn't offer any payment. When I declined to do this, the owner of the company sent me a furious email saying that since I was unwilling to do this job (for free), he would consider my employment null and void. Effectively I am also being fired from my customer service job, which I desperately needed.I saved pdfs of the emails, and I even saved a phone call where he asked me directly to work for free.Should I consider legal action?

Working with my sibling and supervisor prohibited lunch with my sister.,"So I just received news that we have a new supervisor today, I don’t mind and it doesn’t really affect my job. But something he said has been really bothering me. My sister and I both work in the same company. Just different departments. We have the same schedule if not similar so we always take our breaks and lunch together. Today as we had the meeting where he announced that he was the supervisor he also mentioned to me that as a new rule he implemented, I can’t go to lunch or break with my sister. This really pissed me off bc we work in completely different areas and my lunch is not paid. Which brings me to my issue that if I’m not on company time within those 30 mins then why should I listen to an unreasonable demand?

I'm being stalked by a man and the police haven't done anything (yet) and I'm terrified.,"I 31/f live in the south of france. I matched with a guy on an app, and the only thing I said to him was ""nice to meet you, are you in the south of france often?"" and you probably won't believe me, but it unleashed the nightmare that I am living.He sent me probably 40+ messages on an app over the course of a few days (I didn't check it) and so I blocked him when I saw the crazy.Then he started following me on social media, so I blocked him, made everything private, and he then started blowing up my phone and my email, and so I blocked him and told him I want nothing to do with him.This man flew down from Paris, and found me on a public beach. I went to the police and had a male friend confront him and tell him I wanted nothing to do with him.Now he's posting constantly on this public site (anchor.fm) all of this gross sexual stuff, poems, images he's photoshopped of us together, pictures of our ""kids"" and he even bought a ring and considers a ""play"" on a voice message me consenting to something. He's convinced he's moving in with me on Sunday, and I'm afraid to leave my flat.I'm scared for my life. The police haven't done anything yet and I've gone to them twice. I have a folder with 50+ files of evidence. I'm carrying pepper spray on me at all times. I don't know what to do, I spoke to anchor.fm support and asked them to take his account down and they've done nothing yet, which blows my mind.Is there anything I can do other than just wait until something happens?"
I program while at work but my job is commission sales would there be any question who owns the code?,"So I work commission sales, sometimes it gets slow, and there are no customers in the building, I do have other daily tasks that need to get done but usually these are mostly limited to opening and closing (cleaning, making sure deliveries are good to go etc) so they get done. The tasks that aren't limited to those I usually get done as they come up since they are usually just customer issues that need to be tracked down. So sometimes during these slow times I pull out my own laptop and program on some personal projects until a customer comes by (which could be in 10 minutes could be 6 hours).These projects are unlikely to ever actually make money or provide some amount of help to most people they are simply a way for me to build out a portfolio to someday get a job as a software developer and they are my own projects not someone else's open source projects; but, my question is who actually owns the code because this situation seems pretty similar to say the guy who made those Bratz dolls in the 2000s. I think there is enough that distances me from that; though, I did sign a non compete but as far as I'm aware this is only that I cant go to or start a competitor to the business I'm currently apart of for a period of 2 years, but one of the big things I think distances me from that is I work commission I do not get paid unless I sell to a customer (or if my commission is less then minimum wage which does happen from time to time in which case I get minimum wage).I'm not currently in any trouble with this right now and if I ever should be in trouble for this I know to actually get a lawyer."
Double jeopardy question,"Hi there, I’m unfamiliar with the criminal side of the law so I was hoping someone might clarify something for me.  My father in law was recently paroled out of prison for a crime he did 3 years for.  The crime was attacking an officer, fleeing the scene and going over state lines (Oklahoma to Arkansas).  I believe all were felonies.  The OK police caught him right over the border and subdued him by taser at which point the AR police took over.    He did his time in AR after conviction.  Now that he is out on parole, OK has a warrant out for his arrest for fleeing the scene of that same crime and his parole officer is saying he has to turn himself in.  The option for bail bond or attorney is not available due to him not having any funds.  Is this double jeopardy or does that not apply here. All advice welcome and thanks for reading!"
Legal Guardianship over Sibling?,"Indiana, if that changes things.My (22F) mother (40s) has always struggled to be a mother. I am the oldest of 4, and drug after drug, jail stint after jail stint, foster homes and moves, my mother is, to put it nicely, immature.My mother just got custody of them from foster care after they were in there for two years. Admittedly, while I wasn't the one who called, I didn't fight it and even stated that they needed help. She went through rehab but ultimately, she flies between trying to be their best friend and choosing her angry drunk of a bf over them whenever he picks a fight with them. My siblings tell me of the violence and arguing, and send me screenshots of their arguments over text. I never push it because otherwise, it becomes more of a stressor for them and I than it needs to be.I am a teacher, starting at a new school soon and I have such a desire to foster his education since that's what got me out. My youngest sibling (14) asked if he could move in with me (I just bought a new house) and while I would love to get him out of the environment, I just don't know what legal complications this could create.One sibling is about to turn 18 and lives with her boyfriend, another doesn't want to leave and is 1.5 years from 18, so it's really my last sibling that wants to move in. He's bright, has so much potential, but the environment doesn't foster anything good for him. My mother is allowing that sibling to move in with me but won't sign legal rights or guardianship fully over to me since ""she just got him back, and he'll only be there for the school year anyway"".I really don't want to get CPS involved since it's really only the youngest that is fully effected by the lack of parental ability. What do I need to enroll him into school? My mom is getting him medical insurance (so she tells me) so what do I need to have complete ability to take care of him to the fullest without involving CPS unnecessarily and while my mother keeps her rights? Is there any way I can share?"
Is it illegal to change the repair after an insurance claim?,"Hey, Michigander here, so a rental property of mine had vandalism on the sliding glass door. There was damage on the frame and glass. We sent in an estimate for both the frame and glass. I don't want to pay the $2,500 deductible and it will take 2-3 weeks to get the glass. If we get the frame and glass, it'll take 2-3 months. If we replace the frame it'll cost like $4,000. If we replace just the glass, it'll cost like $1,000. If I replace the glass, I'll be making a profit from the insurance payment, with the deductible already remove. If I replace the frame and glass, I'll lost $2,500 due to the deductible. Can I just replace only the glass? The tenant says he wants the glass, as it will mean his sliding glass door is only boarded up for 2-3 weeks and not 2-3 months. Please help."
my car was repossessed 4 years ago and now im being sued for the remaining balance. what am i supposed to do?,Asking for a friend.This happened in Georgia 4 years ago.

doing my own prenup could i get some advice on listing assets,"how should they be listed? parcel address?  and what about inherited property, should a prenup disclose property that you are set to inherit and want to keep separate, even if the state considers that separate property, just to show no intent of co-mingling.also i am set on doing this myself, so I would like to know if I wanted to list real property, both owned and inherited on a prenup asset disclosure? the rocket lawyer / other various legal document generating sites provide a template of just address and market value, is that enough? what would be the point of a judge denying a prenup because you didnt show the other party the deed to the spouse you are marrying? or could a prenup be denied because one spouse didnt list all DEBTS even if the other spouse isnt going after that spouses assets?"
Will my plan for dealing with my immature brother ex.,This is a reUpload because I think may have a plan but I need some feed backGoing keep it short but My brother exe has been harassing him in his personal life and anyone who’s associate with him. A good example is her convincing his friends to attack anyone dating him. A scumy one is holding his kids over him saying he will never seen them again. Making him cut off from his friends that are female and other crazy shit. My brother is almost over the edge at this point.Now the plan I have is bringing people that were harassed and cut off as witnesses. I really don’t know if this will work but it’s only thing I can think of.
Will I look dumb if I try this defense in traffic court? (Not a lawyer),"I was pulled over in Pennsylvania tonight for careless driving tonight pulling into my neighborhood and the officer wrote on the citation that I “was definitively scrolling on Instagram”. I wasn’t. My phone is hooked up to Bluetooth in my car. I got a phone call from a family member so I picked up my phone, looked who was calling, swiped to answer and put it down. If that’s illegal, I understand. Look I’m a father of 3, I want the roadways safe. What I am not okay with is how the officer treated me. He asked for my insurance cards and when I unlocked my phone (I have mobile versions) he saw Instagram on the landing page. I was berated for nearly 30 minutes about how I need to change my ways, that I have a family and he can’t believe that I am trying to murder someone else’s, etc. If he would have simply said, “hey I saw you pick up your phone and that is illegal in Pennsylvania, etc.” I would have apologized, paid the fine, and corrected my actions going forward. Now I feel like I  Need to plead not guilty to simply defend my character. Throughout his beration, he mentioned twice that he was sitting right up against the road with his high beams on which is how he was able to see me on my phone. Per Pennsylvania Statutes Title 75 Pa.C.S.A. Vehicles § 4306, “Whenever the driver of a vehicle approaches an oncoming vehicle within 500 feet, the driver shall use the low beam of light.”  Does the fact that he states using high beams as his primary means to see me on the phone make the stop illegal since he was in violation of the stated statues?"
Employer Horror Story,"Hello,My name is [REDACTED]. For the past two months I have been an employee of [REDACTED] in [REDACTED], Michigan. I work as a cook and live in employee housing provided by the owner of the restaurant I work at.
When I arrived here in May, the house was in a state of filth. There is black mold and exposed wiring. There is an employee housing unit across from mine which is not legally habitable because the bedrooms are less than 7 feet across. I recently put in my two-weeks notice to quit because of poor working conditions. Shortly thereafter, I discovered a serious error in my reported hours and pay. I brought this to my manager, who discovered bookkeeping discrepancies that amount to over one thousand dollars of pay that I earned but did not receive. My manager provided documentation for this. After learning this, I used our work messaging app to contact the owner and asked him to meet with me personally so that we could talk about getting my pay corrected. The owner refused to schedule the meeting. I told the owner that a third party was going to audit my wage report, and he responded by terminating my employment. I told the owner that this is wrongful, and he responded by telling me that I have three days to vacate the housing. I don’t have anywhere to go. I told the owner that he needed to serve me an order to evict. I did this in hopes that it would buy me enough time to find a place to stay, because I don’t want to become homeless out here. Shortly after, the owner and his wife appeared at the employee housing. The owner told me I had to leave immediately and threatened me with physical violence. The owner told me that he was going to grab me by my neck and throw me out. His wife was the only other person in the room. After the owner made this threat, I put my phone on record and asked him to apologize for threatening me. The owner repeatedly said “I don’t know what you’re talking about”, and his wife also refused to acknowledge the threat. The owner then called the sheriff, left the house, and stood guard outside in a posse with his wife and two other men, both of whom work for him. I do not know what he told the police. When I went outside, I believe they were audio recording me. The owner said loudly that he was forcing me to vacate because he felt threatened and one of his men began telling me that I had appeared unstable for weeks at work. This is not true and my co-workers will attest to it. This man also said a number of things to insinuate that I was using illegal drugs. I do not use illegal drugs or drink alcohol and will readily submit to drug and alcohol screening in order to prove it. The owner repeatedly told me that I was going to spend the night in jail. I don’t know why I would go to jail because I wasn’t breaking any laws, but this threat made me fear that I had been falsely accused of a crime. I don’t know what he told the police on the phone. I reasonably suspect that they are colluding to fabricate a false narrative about me in order to delegitimize my claims if I pursue legal recourse. I packed my things quickly, left before the police arrived, and got myself a hotel room. Since the owner responded this way, I have no idea how I will ever recover the money that I am owed.What are my options?

My (paid) internship put us on hiatus and won’t tell us when/if we’re coming back. Are they allowed to do this?,"I (20m) started working as a paid intern at a startup on June 6th earlier this summer. Although I had other options, I accepted this position because it offered a large pay. There are two other college aged interns working with me. During the middle of our third week, our supervisor announced that the company has been purchased and we will be going on an (unpaid) hiatus until July 15 and we would receive a lump payment for our first three weeks on July 1st (as we were originally going to be paid bi-weekly). The other interns and I weren’t happy, but we accepted it as it was only 3 weeks. July 1st comes and goes and we haven’t been paid, which the company says is because they had to freeze their payroll until July 15 as they transfer to the other company. We still haven’t been told what company we were bought by, as they said they haven’t “publicly announced it yet” even though we all had to sign NDAs. We had a meeting on July 8th for them to update us on how everything is going, and it was during this meeting that the head of HR said that our supervisor was in an accident and they weren’t sure if she would be returning this summer, which means we wouldn’t be able to return either. At this point we still haven’t been paid and they won’t give us a concrete answer on when/if we’re coming back. I feel as if they’re trying to take advantage of us because we students, are they allowed to just leave us out to dry like this? It’s too late in the summer to find another internship and we’ve already been out of work for three weeks at this point. None of us are really informed about our rights as workers; if need be, could we have a legal case against them seeking compensation for the weeks we were promised to be working?"

U. K. do I have any say over workmen my land lord sends into my house?,"UK property - My landlord is awful. Avoids phone calls (never met or spoken with them) takes ages to reply to messages and sort problems. We've repeatedly had plumbing issues and the person they send round is both incompetent and really shady. I don't want them in my house, I don't know if they're even qualified, their work suggests not. They always turn up with a random mate who just hangs around in the house and it makes me very uneasy. I've asked the landlord before to use someone else but they've ignored me, do I have any rights as a tenant? Thank you."

Selling car in IL to person in OH. Does paperwork have to be notarized?,I listed my car on a few websites and had a couple of offers. I was offered full asking price from a person that lives in OH.

I did some online research and found out in the state OH both parties need to sign title in front if a notary for it to legally transfer. Is this true? Is there paper work that can be filled out? Are there any other options?

"I was arrested for a public intox charge on June 1st, in Alabama.

Also, I was arrested for a warrant that I didn't know was put out for me. It was for not paying restitution on an older crime (unlawful B and E of a motor vehicle). So far I've paid $100 or so for the restitution (warrant is gone now).Anyway, I fell asleep on a neighbor's front porch. Don't even remember the last hour or so of the night before either, so I don't know if I was offensive, scary, a nuisance or anything. (Didn't even know people lived in the house - as they live at the front of the apt complex I live in, and never see anybody there or any cars.) There wasn't a blood test or a breath test. May have smelled like alcohol though.Served just a few hours in jail (about 14) before being bailed out. Court is at the end of July. Will that be arraignment or sentencing?

[Question] Powerful people and groups ignoring the constitution in spite of court orders. What happens?,"With the recent 2A rulings from SCOTUS, one ruling and a bunch of GVRs, and the State of California putting forth a proposal for a new law that everyone can recognize is a direct violation of the SCOTUS ruling, it raises a question in me.Be it California or Texas, what happens when a State simply ignores SCOTUS and does their thing anyway? Texas says ""All guns are now legal, anywhere any time, for everyone."" and the ATF shows up knocking on Billy Bob's house for violating Federal Laws, but the Sheriff shows up and arrests all the Federal Agents for violating Billy Bob's rights. Or California says ""All guns are Illegal for everyone not a law enforcement agent/officer.""You get all the Federal Court orders, but they are ignored by the State. The courts all agree that California/Texas are in the wrong, but they're doing it anyway in defiance of the court order. Or, say President Biden threatens to ignore SCOTUS and enforce his own laws, be they passed by congress or not. (Assuming that there's agreement from various executive branch agencies to carry out those orders.)What actually is supposed to happen when POTUS and the Executive branch ignores the Judicial Branch that his actions are illegal and to stop doing whatever it is? What happens when a State does it?"
Can my boyfriend’s crazy mom ruin our ability to close on our new home?,"Bf and I recently started the process on closing on our first home together. We won’t be able to move to our home until August 5.Currently, we are renting from his mother. Bf has lived in this rental (3 bedroom farmhouse owned by her) since 2017. Their agreement was that he would pay the mortgage and she would let him live in the house until the mortgage was paid off and sign the deed over to him. When he and I started dating (2 years ago) all was well. I moved in last year and we had a baby. We have two older children as well from previous relationships.For clarification, his mother doesn’t live here. She lives with her boyfriend in a different place.Bf’s mother has always been a heavy drinker. She made a huge scene in front of the kids a few months ago while inebriated and put them in danger with her actions. We decided that we would cut her off from communication other than to tell her when we had dropped money off to her for the mortgage.  Meanwhile, we began to look for another place to live.We don’t let her see the kids because of what she has done and as a result of that, she has harassed us endlessly. Most recently, she has served us with court papers for an eviction hearing.She’s told my bf’s brother that she would drop the suit against us if we would let her see the children again.Is that even legal? And can she screw us over on our ability to close on our new home if the judge awards her an eviction on us? Our hearing is dated a few weeks before we are due to close on the house."
Firework Lawn Fire (minor),"I live in Indianapolis and was setting off fireworks tonight (July 2nd) during the legal set firework timeframe set by the city. We set up in the center of the cul-de-sac circle since that was the largest amount of pavement in the cul-de-sac. We didn't invite any of our neighbors, but we did let the ones we knew that we were going to have our family holiday on the 2nd. We started lighting off our fireworks and a few neighbors came out to see what was going on. One lady came out and watched for 5-10 minutes and then went back inside. Saying nothing. Another neighbor's children were watching from the window. No one was complaining.Then the accident happened. One of our larger fireworks sparks hit a stack of 3 multi-shot fountain squares. I went to try to get the out of the way, but it was too late. 2 of fuses were off and running. Well the one on top was knocked over by the one it was sitting on top of. This caused it to start shooting out the projectiles to the side. My family started darting around to ensure the young children were out of the way and safe. 90% of the sparks stayed in the cul-de-sac as expected, but 2 sparks hit 2 different neighbors lawns and ignited. One has a burn area of 2x6 and 1x4 and the other a patch of 3x7. We put the fires out very quickly. Needless to say the neighbors affected were not very happy. They were honestly very belligerent and today you would have said they were acting like Karens. I, of course apologized and tried to explain what had happened, but they just wanted to yell and cuss at my family (2 and up children present) and this set off my children and their spouses. Luckily it did not come to blows. One of the neighbors called the police about us letting off the fireworks; even though a release was made letting people know it was legal and not to waste the police's time. They did not come.All of that to come to my legal question; what am I responsible for and what upper ground do they have? I would be willing to pay for sod to be placed in the areas burnt, but I won't pay for a whole yard treatment. Anyone's fireworks could have done the same thing. We were just the unlucky family that caused it this time. Everyone knows that fireworks will be going off for the next 2 weeks and that they need to keep their grass moist to prevent anything. Hell even the city's fireworks could have caused their fire. I'm not trying to wiggle out of the sod, but I don't want to have to deal with redoing their whole front your or worse a lawsuit.Any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

What can I do about neighbor's animals in my yard?,"In rural iowa, USA.My neighbors have a nice long history in our small town for being awful animal owners. Most recently, they have been told by the city to get rid of their 3 horses. Having them breaks city ordinances, but because the town is so small and funding minimal, not much has really been done.Neighbors and myself have made police reports about neglect, written letters to the city council, and signed petitions. Because we are their closest neighbor who has reported them, they spent an entire year harassing us and only recently stopped due to yet another police report telling them to stop.They have a young goat and pony they let free range around their yard. The goat regularly comes into our yard and garden. It's a pain. We have returned the goat a handful of times and get yelled and cursed at. The neighbors make a big stink on Facebook and the landlord has requested we ""just drop it"" because they are harassing him, too.Anyway, the goat sittuation is just getting too ridiculous.   It's eating my produce, stressing out my dogs, and has recently started to headbutt with it's horns. We've had enough. Nothing gets done and I'm about one incident away from shooting the damn thing. What can I do that is within my rights to stop this?"
is there any legal reason someone would have to put a speed bump at the bottom of their driveway?,"So the reason im asking this is because last summer I was at my boyfriends house in my mom's car was parked on the street and when i got home the next morning, we saw the door was super scratched up. Reason we didnt notice the night before was because it was pouring and dark out when I left. We asked the neighbor who's driveway comes out directly across from where I was parked. Claimed he knew nothing and my boyfriend said he didnt see any damage to their cars so we were forced to file a hit and run claim.Now my boyfriend said there was an unmarked police car at that neighbors house last week and now they have a speed bump at the bottom of their driveway. It's a suburban neighborhood, speed likit 25 and its not a long driveway. I am wondering if something would happen that would cause them to put a speed bump at the bottom of their driveway for some legal reason or if it was just a preference."
In need of Legal research resources... but no affiliations and little to no money to access them.,"Hello!I am a freelance science writer and I am working with a lawyer to help with a medical case.

Could the USA legally split?,I am trying to ask a legal not political question specifically. It seems that the USA’s left and right will never be able to co-exist comfortably.

"Buying a house without our agent involved, just wondering what steps to take.","We had put an offer up for a previous house and lost because not only did our agent tell us to do an FHA and the sellers preferred conventional, when they asked her if we could switch, she never brought that to our attention. The selling realtor called us to tell us because he was really disappointed in her representation of us and he wanted us to know. We did initially put an offer through her on the house we just won the bid on, if that’s relevant. The home owner called us and told us she didn’t even remember our names when trying to put in our offer. The homeowner actually took our contract we signed when putting in the offer on the first house we lost to her friend who’s a lawyer and he said it’s not viable for three reasons. 1.) there’s no date from when we signed 2.) there’s no counties listed for where the contract covers 3.) she had no involvement of us finding the house, communicating with the owners and touring the house, she just put the offer, which was denied and then we put in a separate one without her. We were going to put the house in my name as well because my fiancé is the one that signed the contract with the realtor. Does this situation require us to call and fire her? She basically never reaches out trying to send us homes anyways and she doesn’t even know our names apparently. I obviously don’t want to get sued though even if the contract isn’t viable, they could still try. I just am not sure the best way to move forward."
I can't remove my couch due to apartment lowering ceilings.,I moved into this apartment about a year ago and I bearly got my couch into it. Well over this past year they have lowered the ceilings in the hallway due to added piping. With the new lowered ceilings I know there is no way I am able to remove my couch. I really want to keep my couch. My question is can they remove a window being I am on ground floor or how should I approach this. Do I just have to say goodbye to the couch. I am from Minnesota

My wife's estranged father has dementia: Should we be concerned about filial responsibility in Oregon?,"As stated in the title, my wife's father, who she has been mostly estranged from(less than 10 instances of contact in the past 13 years+abusive upbringing) was diagnosed with dementia a few months back. Currently he lives with his wife(my wife's mother) as well has his sister(my wife's aunt). Our last contact with him was over 2 years ago and she has no intent of ever seeing him(or anyone else mentioned) again. She has recently become concerned that we may become financially liable for any care he may receive before he passes. As far as I can tell, filial responsibility laws are almost never enforced in Oregon, but nevertheless we want to try and cover our tracks. Can anyone offer some insight here before I call my lawyer? Thanks!"

2022 Hyindai Kona Engine Failure,"I bought a 2022 Kona 11 months ago. I took it to the shop Monday over some issues it was having. Come to find out today thw engine burned up. According to the Hyundai dealership, they are known for putting cheap engines in the car then having to replace them.I had issues with the car turning off while driving it, the AC randomly stop working, the screen freezing, etc.Their solution is to just replace the engine, but how long will it be until it happens again?I am financed through Hyundai. I want them to keep my car and put me in something of equal value of what remains on my loan. Is that something I can legally push for and how do I do it?"
Does mixing M&Ms with Skittles count as food tampering?,
Note: obvious throwaway,"TL;DR: After car accident (year ago), in pain and on meds, I was threatened that I would receive no medical help unless I signed. I was given medical advice by the insurance and told that their insurance would be taken anywhere. After 5 months (1 month before expiration) of searching, I found a place but the medical ""help"" expired before finding out more about my problems. Six (6) months after that, my health problems kept worsening. Been legally advised to do smalls claims. Don't want money, just to be treated (even threw my orthopedics shoes after one of my legs grew).A year ago I got into an accident (pickup hit me from the driver's side). I lost a week's groceries, my work, and my car was damaged. I was under pain, medication, and had slow/slurred speech. Here are the issues that took place before I signed the waiver:Sporadic relationship with the insurance, I was forced to contact insurance whenever my memory and ability served.Gaslit to believe it was normal and just sign the documents, given false promises into signing (I would receive medical help, I can go anywhere with it, was never told it was a third party insurance).Despite my condition insurance offered no help in collecting and organizing information, told to summit same information despite problems (laptop damage and testimony).It was a long and arduous process, with the responsibility to follow up and even reclarifying (remind them of my condition) falling on me.Even their estimates of their car repairs failed to take into account motor damage which I ended up paying out of my own pocket (emergency).Despite all these problems, I managed to get money for my laptops (client and partner data) and the immediate car repairs. Though their estimate was horrible as I was forced to later spend $5,000 on motor replacement, the mechanic told me it was due to the accident and that it was a miracle that the motor operated despite of it."
Legal for a company to put non-solicitation of employees clause in exit certificate?,"I am leaving my company today and one of the documents they asked me to sign before leaving is a combination confidentiality reminder + non solicitation clause basically saying that I cannot recruit any employees to leave my current company and/or jump to the new company.I have never had to sign an exit agreement like this before and wondering if this is legal (state of california)?  I asked what are the consequences of not signing and the HR lady said she didn't know bc no one pushed back on it.I've already received my last paycheck so not sure what leverage the company has in this case or if this is even legal in my state?  In other words, I could just NOT sign it.Any thoughts would be appreciated"

broker landlord,"Landlord was ordered by the city to do maintenance via rental inspection and service letter. He waited until the last week of the notice to turn up(yesterday), and his behavior has become increasingly erratic. He's broken into our home several times to try to access the electrical box in the garage(fire authority has told him he needs an electrician due to several code updates behind) He's scared my kids by showing up unannounced. Come back after he was allowed to work for 7hrs that day. Broke into a locked door and came inside with my kids here, he knew they were set to be alone for a gap before my s/o got home. We cooperate for maintenance whenever we have an appointment. Our rent has been paid on time for 4 years. No missed during pandemic etc. His partner has been trying to reel him in, but it's getting ridiculous. He purposely demolished the outer wall directly before it rained etc. I've contacted police any time he's broken in physically, but they say its his to break. They won't even take a proper report because legally tenants are dogs. Nobody cares if you kick your dog, you're just a jerk. I applied for a tpo and tied his hands via email. His maintenance person misrepresented themselves as a licensed plumber and then as a realty broker (he is neither, though he was once a broker) and tried to solicit me for matienence I was already owed. I asked him not to return. He ran pitential buyers through posing as maintenance. I now check all credentials. He sent two people over to bang on the walls and front door. When I asked why they said my doorbell didn't work and they needed on the roof. Just..generally nonsense harassment. No notice, no actual work just tearing things apart. I've kept all appointments with the other owner. An appointment showed up today (legal mitigation company hired by landlord) and confirmed existence of potential friable asbestos underneath our carpet. Mold intrusion, etc. Landlord has refused an epa certified test thus far, though he did come punch 5 holes in the kitchen ceiling in the one place without popcorn ceiling. Maintenance letter from the city had 47 habitability items. He had told us a mitigation had been done. We were helping him update failing fixtures etc as he'd offered to roll it into a mortgage initially. Home was built in 1973. Has had tenants full time since 92. We stopped all work once potential asbestos was found in ceiling, attic, and under carpeting (whole of house spare bathrooms and kitchen, 1860 sq ft) To boot I found out during the course of due dilligence that potentially he's involved in mortgage fraud with his maintenance man? Partner? etc...it's a much deeper hole than I really wanted to dig in. Id rather walk away from this property. Landlord is also a realty broker. First and foremost I'm out at the end of my lease (aug 7th) new housing already secured etc. Family has had health issues since they replaced the carpeting...odd interaction with the carpet guys I can't shake. Inspections have proved him negligent but..unsure how to proceed. There is... so much more than I had anticipated. Video of all interactions since letter was sent etc.  Epa has contacted him directly etc. His own contractor was here Monday and confirmed mold, potential asbestos both above in attic and ceilings and below the flooring underneath carpet. CREC violations abound...In Colorado.  Currently the mold is increasing due to hold up on testing. I'm familiar with tenant law and city code etc. Looking for someone familiar with realty law in CO. Specifically brokers who manage their own properties."
Hiring one person temp and another straight on and tipping temp employees-TN,"I have 2 questions for you (I live in Nashvilles). So last year for the third holiday season, I went back to my old job at a Factory as a  shipping clerk. The job has alot of downtime  so I would also work the counter greeting customers give them the cookies and so on and so forth. The past 3 years, my boss has always promised me she would give me a full time job since they liked my work ethic and was great with customers but every time there was always some excuse as to why it fell through.  (Last time it was that the two my boss chose were mothers and more needed the work) After the last holiday season, Id heard that one person they hired was being fired so I came in and asked for the job. Since I've worked there now three years, they knew me, and I know the temporary agency gets a cut up my money, I asked if I could just be hired on full-time since I'd proven 3xs over I could do the job . I was specifically told HR that they were NOT ALLOWED to hire anyone outside of the agency because of some contracts. After working there for two months a girl comes in, gives me her resume, tell her about the agency rule but take her resume and give it to my boss. Then bam they hire her on no agency ! I think, that's really strange because they don't know this person yet they know me and know I'm good for the work that they specifically said they were not allowed to fire so questionAre you allowed to hire employees under different circumstances like that?Like, to tell an employee that they already know it's good for the work no I have to do another three or four months of temp work before they could decide to take me and it would also exclude me from benefits and other perks (like tips - big issue) for a few months.  But then let another person be hired normally. They were only about 3 or 4 weeks between the ending of my last contract before I came back for this last one and asked if I was still in the window where I could be hired from the last contract but HR said noMy second question is, are they allowed to keep tips from you if you are temporary worker when you're interacting with the customers and that's what most people tip? We were told that we were paid extra to make up the difference (which was 1 to 2 dollars max) but it seems completely unfair for us to have to take customer tips and have them thrown into a pool that me and my other co-worker weren't allowed to get from?  On my last week where my coworker did receive the tips it was about $350 ('gourmet cookies' $27 a dozen so tips add up with 3 people working the counter). Is that legal at all? HR told us that we were not allowed to get them because we would have to declare them and they'd be taxed and the agency forbade it (and that we were paid more than the full time workers) to which I said that makes no sense. I'd rather be taxed and get something as opposed to nothing.  I called the the agency and asked if the no decision was actually true and they said that that was not true, that we could be paid in tips but we would have to just declare them.  My co-worker and I ran the counter so we were actually interacting with customers and getting the tip money and everything while my boss was in the back taking all day to do paperwork  and on her phone-added blah blah -My time ended under bad circumstances when my boss, who's straight up did not like me, lied and made up some things about me being late  (car was stranded for 2 says working with AAA-gave a call I MIGHT be late but was on time and being labeled insubordinate for listening to the warehouse manager telling me I could not be in a certain area while he was moving pallets, and her going ballistic for using a small towel as a sweat rag (from having to run around the warehouse restocking and getting things she would never handle) and I feel honestly  like I was treated differently there than the others . I am a black gay guy, and the entirety of the staff there is all white women.  My boss had the final say and they couldn't even give me one reason why they were letting me go other than what she said, no investigation no listening to my side of the story . We didn't get along and it was her decision. She stated that, I was hired more to do the manly things like move the boxes, which also found a bit insulting considering I taught her how to do her job and did her job better than her and work two jobs the past 3 years I was thereso my questions areTldrCan you tell when employees are not allowed to hire directly but then turn around and hired directly just a few weeks after giving them certain perks like benefits and tips?    And"

Airbnb host agreed to refund the cleaning fee but now the host and airbnb won't give the refund,"I booked an Airbnb for a few nights. After the cancelation date, I found someone who could host me for free closer to the area I wanted to be in. The day of my check in I told the host that I won't be staying there and if she would refund the cleaning fee. She agreed that after she gets paid she would refund it if I do not stay in the place. I never stayed in the place and waited for the refund to come.I reached out to airbnb to find out whats going on and with screenshots of the chat where the host agreed to send the refund. Airbnb tells me that they need to confirm with the host. The host confirmed but said she changed her mind because of the inconvenience and will not refund the cleaning fee.I told airbnb that the host or airbnb needs to abide by the written agreement. Airbnb is not willing to help. Am I in the wrong here? Is there something I should to get a refund?"

Non-compete as a software customer,"This may be routed in urban legend / just used as scare tactics, but I've heard of people receiving 'cease and desist' orders for creating competing software while being a customer of another software vendor. I am referring to, for the sake of example, unemployed persons.Let's say I have a good idea for a chat platform. I've heard of people getting letters telling them to 'cease and desist' on projects that could take revenue away from an existing platform (D--cord).  I would get it if you were violating a patent AND generating revenue, but from what I've heard this is not the case. They are simply saying 'since you saw our product, you are not allowed to attempt to make anything that could ever compete with it times infinity.'How accurate is that? How likely are they to win in court by suing an ex-customer? Do I need to start reading my EULAs more carefully?This parallels me buying an Apple Flavored Yankee Candle, burning it, realizing I don't like the smell. So I  hunt down a specific type of apple, mixing it with various spices like video games and bandwidth, and create a new gamer candle. Yankee Candle can't come at me and say 'You need to stopped making candles cuz you bought one of ours.' -- right?To me this is just a scare tactic. AFAIK 'cease and desist' letters could be sent to everyone in the world because they MIGHT be violating a patent. Making it very easy to manipulate people into acting out of fear rather than intelligence. Are they violating the patent? No. Could an attorney still send them a letter (not a lawyer, but I think the answer is yes).Also, I've seen this more as a CYA thing than actual predatory legal practices, but the opportunity is there for it to become so. Trying to learn what I don't know so I can cut off bogus legal threats if I encounter them."
CT/RI/Narragansett Tribe Child Custody,"All Names changed but: Okay so the gist is my mom Beth has a husband John. John and Beth got married like 15 years ago and John had a daughter from a previous marriage, named Anna. Anna has recently (like within the last week) had a baby named Lola. Anna had the baby taken away because of a drug issue. My mother and step father were given the baby by CPS, but then taken away within the first day because they live in RI and not CT where the baby was born. The local Indian tribe factors in because they want to fight Ct to get custody (but want to give it to my mom and step dad). But DCYF from CT and RI says it could take 8 months for my mom and step father to get custody of their grand daughter. So my question is, basically, what the heck are their options? 8 months seems like an insane amount of time to just have the baby bouncing around in foster care when she has grandparents fifteen minutes away across state lines."

Late Wage Adjustment in Utah,"So, I’ve recently been promoted (yay me or whatever.)Part of that promotion came with a raise, with a start date indicated in the offer letter I both received and accepted. It is currently 22 days after I should have seen a paycheck with the increase in wage, with nothing to show for it.Insofar as I’m aware, Utah requires employers to pay employees for services rendered within 10 days of the scheduled pay-date. My question becomes: do agreed upon dates of wage adjustment qualify for that protection? IE, does my raise count as something that should be protected by this? Or does me being paid at my former rate count as being paid for services rendered?"

Apparently he did that to the last person that quit on him without a notice.

$594 Insufficient Notice Fee,"Hello all.I'm nearing the end of my lease and my apartment manager is telling me I have to pay a $594 insufficient notice fee because I gave my 60 day notice about 10 days late. I posted a letter to the Manager's door on May 28th(I've posted physical correspondence to the managers door as long as I've lived here without issue so I didn't think anything of it).On June 11th I followed up because I hadn't gotten the confirmation of receipt I requested in the notice. She told me she never received it and that I had to either email it or hand it to her physically. Looking at the lease, I let her know that it specifically stated I'm allowed to post any correspondence directly onto the Manager's door. When I let her know that, she said that since she never received it, it doesn't matter.Now, the two buildings on the property have been experiencing a ton of theft and vandalism over the last few months.Granted, I have no proof that I posted the notice, should I be responsible for ensuring a note I leave on the door isn't taken by someone else?She's insisting the fee be paid along with this month's rent but I'm hesitant to pay because I did everything the lease outlined in order to fulfill my obligation for a 60 day notice. Is it in my best interest to pay the fee and pursue it in small claims court or refuse to pay? Can I still pursue it in small claims court if I refuse to pay the fee?Thanks, all."

State says I committed unemployment fraud but I didn't.,"I was furloughed during the pandemic and was out of a job for about 5 weeks, during which time I lawfully claimed unemployment.

Dealership mechanics installed driveshaft prior to road trip (CA to AK). Broke down 1k miles later and now am stuck in OR. Not sure if it was a part failure or improperly installed. Trip is now falling apart through no fault of my own. Thats life or do I need a lawyer?,"Details: I am a Florida resident that lived in California for three months.

Is she entitled to half the money under any circumstance?,"(I am posting this in as many groups in hopes someone can help!)Hi so this is a long shot and I will try to make it short with giving a little bit of back story. Anyways a family member of mine has been together with their partner for 8+ years and thinks they’re married by common law, they’ve lived together the whole time and have brought 2 wonderful girls into the world.The relationship went south a about 4 years in. For the past 3 years the partner (M) has been using drugs like crazy, he suffered with addiction in the past coke,  heroin, opioids, etc. but it is known knowledge and has been known knowledge for about 2 years now and he is admitting it, it was known about coke and opioids, but now heroin as well.Started hiding his money, wouldn’t bring any home putting his partner (F) and the family in constant debt (almost lost they’re house, barely puts food on the table for the kids etc) , as well as of last week stole his 4 year olds daughters preschool money out of her backpack, and is around the kids alone constantly the family is about done with letting this happen, as it’s about safety of the kids now. If (F) wants to do it to herself then fine but when he’s driving the kids and alone with them it’s not okay. (Age 7, and 4)Anyways with a little bit of backstory (F) doesn’t want to leave yet as she thinks when this money comes through in a year she will be entitled to half legally. (M) had a large mod vape in his pocket about 2 years ago and it exploded leaving him with a large burn as well as left the floor charred. So they sued and they/he are for sure getting a minimum of 65,000. He’s already talked about as soon as he gets it he’s going to leave, so (M) will not give any to (F) period let alone continuing addiction as deep as (M’s)  in.It’s really hard to find a straight answer by looking it up but everything I have read states that she will not be entitled to half legally, no matter if they’re married by common law because it is from a personal injury no matter the circumstances including if (F) went after (M) for child support since he would technically have more money they still wouldn’t take that into account because it is from personal injury and technically has nothing to do with her.So I just wanted to hear some lawyers takes on this and if there would even be any legal action she could take if he did not give her any part of it and if it is possible could she still get half if they aren’t together any more. I am just looking for legal advice on this after we figure this out if she doesn’t do something as a family we’ve decided to possibly get cps involved for the kids sake as it’s a huge safety risk and honestly not sure if he will even live the next year like this.Sorry didn’t want to make it too long but still wanted to include the situation and what’s happening if that would change anything. Morally of course she should get half but legally and morally obviously don’t mix or matter."

They have charged me the $35 copay numerous times.Several weeks after my first appointment I received notice from my insurance that the claim for the first visit was denied as they were ""out of network.""The administrator for the practice told me over email,I can assure you that your patient responsibility is the $35 copay.  We are in network with xxx Healthcare but recently, xxx Healthcare have been making mistake processing some claims as out of network.  Our Central Billing Office are aware of this issue, but unfortunately, they wouldn't know it was processed incorrectly until they received the explanation of benefits.  They will send back claims for reprocessing to be corrected.  Nevertheless, you will not be responsible for any additional amount rather than what we were quoted when we verified your benefits which is $35 co pay. I called them on the phone and they said it usually takes several months to reprocess the claims and that this email was ""proof"" I wouldn't be responsible for over 35/session so not to worry.I don't know if I believe that, and am concerned seeing as ""several months"" at a sticker price of $377 would add up to over 7k.It is also my understanding that the email as ""proof"" would be little help to me because the only way to actually enforce it, if they billed me over 7k, would be to take them to court, which would end up costing me thousands of dollars as well.I'd rather not delay my PT for months, but I don't want to take on the risk of 7k debt to this place.What should I be doing to cover myself?Thank you.

"After reclaiming a repossessed car the loan was lost, what do I do?","My boyfriends car was repossessed in Decemeber,  and we reclaimed the car in late January, paying all fees and charges involved as well as getting the loan current as of that time. However our old lender informed us that a new company would be taking on the loan and that we would be contacted with the new information. Since then my boyfriend has made several calls to both our old lender and the new one both claiming they have no records of the loan. I was a cosigner on the original loan as well. My question is, the loan should have been present months ago, and we are trying to save money to make sure we can pay it, as a car isnt free. We are worried that once the loan is found we will have to pay the whole  sum, but we have no idea of the new payment. What can we do, we really want to do this right. We worked very hard to get the car payment and reclaim our car, but are worried it will be repossessed again outside of our controll. A loan cannot dissapear, but how can we find it?"

"If my physical therapy center told me my treatment was approved by insurance and charged me the $35 copay three times, but it was never approved, do I have any legal recourse?","My PT center charged me $35 on my credit card for each of three sessions at time of service. I asked the first time explicitly if this meant the sessions were approved by my insurance and the administrator/person at the desk said yes.I just received notice the first visit's claim was processed and denied, which has me on the hook for $377. If all sessions were denied, I would be on the hook for $1131 for services that I was under the distinct impression were covered and involved only a $35 copay.Unfortunately, I read reviews of other patients having billing issues (though not specifically this) and I strongly suspect that the claims were never approved, the girl misspoke and assumed they were approved, and charged the $35 copay because that's what they expected the copay to be.I understand getting an actual lawyer would be more expensive than the actual charge, but I'm considering doing something like legalshield just to get a demand letter because I suspect with the threat of legal action they may just decide to forgive the unexpected out of pocket charges.That said, is this even a situation where I would have legal merit in writing a demand letter to recoup unexpected out of pocket charges due to their misrepresenting information about my coverage?State: IL, US"

How much time will my father spend in jail based on breaking his probation,"My father is unsure of how much time he’s going to spend in jailSo my father was arrested in Texas on a drug related charge and sentenced to around 9 months in Safe P and then three years probation, well when he got out of safe P he didn’t keep up with or meet any of the standards at all and in his words it was due to COVID. He is being sentenced to 12 months for breaking his probation and his lawyer said that his Safe P months should carry over and count so he could be out in only a couple months with no probation.Now that’s what he told us and we haven’t talked to his court appointed attorney so we don’t know for sure but I don’t see how the Safe P time for the drug charge could carry over to his time for breaking probation.Is this possible in any way? And I’m not versed in law so if I need to add something else I left out let me know and I’ll edit itIt may also be important to mention that he failed for meth and alcohol when he was taken in recently before his sentencing."
Walmart radiator burst and damaged hundreds of bucks worth of stuff. Walmart is not responsive. What can I do,"I bought a $45 radiator from Walmart online about 3 months ago. It burst a week ago, in the morning waking me up and damaged lots of stuff including blankets, clothes, both the couch and mattress of a futon-bunkbed, some electronics and some food I had just bought. I live in a tiny SRO-Style room in San Francisco. I would realistically price the damage in the high hundreds. My apartment reeks of oil and my bed is still soaked, I have no way to replace it or clean it. I burned me a little but not severely. The blankets and clothes have stains that can't be removed and they still smell bad after a hot wash cycle with lots of soap and odor removers. I'm trying to get a job at the moment and have extremely limited funds. It's forcing me to delay things. It also destroyed the only alarm clock I have. Since I don't have the money to replace it, I can't go to any job interview in the morning for a while. That forced me to skip a job interview. It cost around $30 dollars and hours to clean up so far. I called Walmart to discuss the incident and let them know I wanted money for damaged items and cleanup costs. Walmart refunded me and said they'd contact me in 72 hours to discuss the rest including sending someone over to clean it up for me. It's been 3 days and that never happened. I called them again and I got another 12-24 hour time window in which they promised to contact me. I have a feeling it probably won't happen again. What can I do?"

How to best dispute what I believe to be an unlawful charge from Airbnb?,"Here's a summary of the events I put together, I'm looking to file consumer protection or police reports. I'd really appreciate someone telling me if there are other courses of action I can go down concurrently. I've never gotten this in the weeds against a big company before, but I've also never felt this unfairly treated by one before.On Feburary 26, I booked a reservation for a room in East Palo Alto (HM8JFKYHM5) for the dates May 22 to August 13, for a total cost of $4,544.73.This was a reasonable market rate for rooms at this time, booking this far in advance.On April 28, the host canceled, citing the room being damaged. At this point, rooms were significantly more in the area.I was given a coupon from Airbnb for $169.74 on a reservation totaling at least $4109.00.Available listings in the area were, at the time of the host’s cancellation, roughly $6,000 higher total cost for the duration of my stay, an amount not fully covered by the $169.74 coupon.On April 28, I responded by asking the host if there were any alternatives- including sleeping on a couch until the room was repaired, or staying in another lodging until the room was repaired.The host responded by saying he could provide us with a stay that involved 2 separate rooms. I agreed.On April 30, The host then gave me his number and asked me to call him.In this call, the host told me he tried to reinstate the booking with Airbnb, and Airbnb was unable to do this. He proposed that I wire him $1,500 cash “security deposit” to reserve the room. In his proposal, I would still pay the full $4,500, but at least I’d get the room. I mentioned that I thought that may be acceptable, but after hanging up and discussing with others, I believed wiring a stranger $1,500 was too risky.Over text, I explained I was uncomfortable with the situation, and asked if he could simply list the new rooms on Airbnb.The host then sent me links of listings which were ~$1,100 higher than the previous bookings.I explained that I was comfortable with signing a contract, pay-on-arrival, and sending the previously agreed upon rate (where he would still be getting the extra full Airbnb seller and buyer fees). He did not respond to my messages.Panicked about the prospect of not having a property and seeing that the cancellation policy was “Strict”, I booked both rooms- one from May 22 to July 2 (HMQ3BAPZ8P), one from July 2 to August 13 (HM8JFKYHM5).“Strict” cancellation policy is listed as such: To receive a full refund, guests must cancel within 48 hours of booking, and the cancellation must occur at least 14 days before check-inLess than 48 hours after the reservation, I tried to cancel both bookings due to finding another reservation. I was relieved to have a landlord who I was not afraid of (as the host had explicitly used, and potentially created, our housing insecurity to make a profit).Reservation HM8JFKYHM5 was cancelled without issue. However, HMQ3BAPZ8P I was not able to cancel due to Airbnb’s policy on “long term” stays."

"Not looking for advice, just looking for estimates pertaining to a potential lawsuit","For context of regional legality: this is in the city of Fort Collins, Larimer County, Colorado.So, I was recently hired for a job, and I've worked one day so far. The place is a smoke shop, part of a chain, and this location also acts as a distribution hub for the other stores in the chain, which is inter-county, so it's a fairly large scale 18/21+ organization. Problem is, in my one day, I've seen way, way too many red flags: firstly, they actually denied my application on Indeed and then a few days later asked me if I could come in for a trial shift because they were urgently hiring, apparently there had been something of a mass exodus of around 30 employees all quitting around the same time; they never asked me for any information, identification, paperwork, etc.; they pay in cash; they don't have a clocking in system; most importantly, when I was 5 hours into my 7 hour shift, I was taking a break as I was told to by my trainer after I finished what I was working on, and was about 5 minutes into that, when someone came in saying ""Hey, I'm the guy that pays people here, and I don't pay people to just sit around on their phones, so you just go home."" He kept cutting me off and was extremely rude, I didn't get to explain that I was in training and that I was supposed to learn how to close, instead he denied me a legally required break, and didn't even make me get back to work. Also, their communication has been extremely poor, no one knows anything about who's doing what or where they'll be or when.My current plan is to tell them that it's not working out and that I'd like to just get paid for the hours I worked - even if they want to argue that they don't have any documentation or record that I worked there, I'm going to bring it to the authorities that they denied me a break and my payment, and didn't ask for any identification despite being 18/21+, selling things like CBD and Delta 8 cannabis and kratom. Those things are illegal for employers to do, or neglect to do, and I do have evidence that I worked there, both in text conversations between me and the one who hired me as well as security footage in the store.So, if this does go to court, and if I win the lawsuit, what kind of payout would I be looking at, and what fees would detract from it by how much?"

This was because I took a vacation to visit family and we do not receive PTO (it's a small business).This comment was made in front of 2 coworkers, both of which I am the superior of. Honestly, this was the cherry on top of a large mountain of shit that I am sick of putting up with and drove me to finally write my overdue letter of resignation.I intend to bring this situation up to my boss during the conversation of me resigning, but I was curious to know if any laws were broken? I know that it is not illegal for me to discuss my pay with coworkers, but is it illegal for my pay to be discussed with my coworkers without my approval? Or is it illegal for the individual in charge or payroll to make these types of comments?Thanks for any insight you can provide!"

"Airbnb cancellation situation- misread policy, maybe under duress?","Followup to this if you're actually willing to read the whole thing:https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLegal/comments/ufg1tz/airbnb_host_strongarming_me_afraid_contacting/I booked an Airbnb for a 12 week stay while I do an internship. The host cancelled a couple days back, citing a trashed room, just 3-4 weeks before the start date. At this point, rates are much higher for this area. I asked him if he's able to let us stay in the trashed room or couch while it's being repaired, as we don't have options. He gives me his number so we can talk outside of Airbnb, where he proposed we don't use Airbnb, but I send a security deposit. I tell him I'm not comfortable sending money to a stranger, but offer pay-on-arrival or him relisting his properties on Airbnb. He opens up 2 new listings (one for the first 6 weeks, one for the last) for a total of about $1,100 more than the old one, and basically tells me tough luck. I book because we have no housing and I see a 48 hour full refund cancellation policy, while looking for a new place.As luck would have it, tonight I found a friendly guy renting a room closer to the original rate I paid. He was willing to sign tonight, told another guest looking at the room it was booked, and I went to cancel the Airbnb booking.Well, only the listing that was for the second half of the stay had the 48 hour full refund, as the first one was closer than in the next 28 days. I'm fully aware this was my oversight.Like an idiot, I contacted Airbnb support and told them about the host's out-of-policy proposal, and asked for a refund. They basically said policy is policy. At this point, I believe they will have informed the host about what I've accused him of. I messaged the host politely asking if he could ease his cancellation policy, but based off his prior actions I doubt he will.So now I've signed 2 rental agreements, one with landlord who will take any opportunity to make money and will not let this cancellation happen (well, with Airbnb mediating it), the other with a very nice person who I'd like to stay with, and equally not reneg a contract with.Is there any course of action I can take to get that money back for the first booking from Airbnb?Wondering if I can potentially use this: airbnb.com/help/article/1320/extenuating-circumstances-policy"

I booked this 6 weeks ago, the booking duration is for 12 weeks in the Summer, starting in 3 weeks.A couple days back, the host cancelled saying the last guest trashed the room, and the room wouldn't be fixed for the first couple weeks of our rental. I asked him if we could stay in the trashed room, or on the couch, until it was fixed, as at this point finding a place, especially a short term rental, is way out of budget. These are short term rentals in the bay area- our initial booking for 12 weeks was $4,500. Now looking at similar places 3 weeks from the move-in date, we'd have to pay north of $10k.I contacted Airbnb support and they proudly told me I was compensated a $160 coupon, only usable on a booking of $4,100 or more. They also said they'd message me a list of similar rooms. They haven't gotten back to me with that, probably because they know that similar rooms aren't on their platform for those dates anymore.According to Airbnb listings our host rents out many rooms in a couple of houses in the area. He offered for us to stay in another room for ~4 weeks then move to yet another room. I agreed, and he said tried undo the cancellation with Airbnb, but they were not able to undo a cancellation. He then sent me his phone number and proposed we do a rental contract outside of Airbnb, and I Zelle him the first month's rent upfront.I was open to this idea, but verified with others and decided sending him $1,500 via Zelle was not a good idea. I offered to book the other rooms via Airbnb or pay on arrival. He said he was doing us a favor by helping accomodate us, and would not hold a room without a deposit. He opened the rooms on Airbnb, but the total cost was $5,600, $1,100 more than previous. The best part is, since it's 2 separate bookings of $2,800, I can't even use the $160 coupon Airbnb gave me earlier.I told him I felt like he assumed very little risk with pay-on-arrival, since we're willing to sign a rental agreement, while I assume a large risk. I offered to pay the full $4,500, allowing him to circumvent Airbnb fees (which again, was his idea originally). I told him it felt like he was strong-arming us.He did not respond to my messages. After about an hour, I booked the Airbnbs for $5,600, and he accepted them promptly. After I booked, he said he was ""sorry I felt like I was being strong-armed"", that we didn't have to book it, but he would have left the rentals open, and the ""risk would have been with us if it was booked"".Due to how little help Airbnb was and the fact that we have booked a place already, I'm worried if I contact them the situation will get worse- if the host is warned or banned, he'd assuredly not rent out to me. I also got the vibe Airbnb does NOT have my back- being cancelled on this close to the date is a really difficult situation, and the type of which I thought booking through Airbnb would protect against. This host appears to book around a dozen rooms at this rate, so I imagine they have far more incentive to protect him than me. Even if they didn't, and banned him, that wouldn't resolve my situation.One more thing: the new bookings are for 1 person. The last one was for 2. I'm worried that he may use this to pull something else when we show up as 2 people.As far as evidence, he sent me his phone number via Airbnb messages, but the correspondence isn't extremely clear that he proposed going outside of Airbnb- it's enough for plausible deniability. He proposed it in a call, and I discussed it via text in further communication."
[UK] Theoretical: accountability of manufacturer for insufficient security of a self driving car.,"I'll cut to it, doing a report on this for uni and I'm struggling to figure out how the laws would work in a case like this.So let's say I had a self driving car made by in Britain which, to determine where to go, connected to a cloud server for navigational purposes, and someone breaks the digital security and is able to send commands spoofed as from the server and just decided to activate the brakes on a fast and busy motorway or drive the car into a brick wall as fast as possible.I know the hacker would probably be charged under the computer misuse act, causing damger to road users by interfering with a vehicle and possibly vehicular manslaughter, but would the manufacturer be at fault if the software was deemed to have grossly inadequate security or safeguards in place to prevent tampering in this manner?If its possible as well I'm trying to find analogues for something like this as my searching has come up with very little that would be equivalent."
"Lawyer ""objecting to himself"" in Depp case","I keep seeing people laughing at Amber Heard's lawyer objecting to his own question, but the question asked was ""did you know"" and the witness answered ""Dr Kipper told me.""

Alteration to NYC Rent Stabilized Apartment,"We have an old brick wall in our rent-stabilized unit that is shedding dust. It is a beautiful wall and we don't want to change it, but my partner has asthma and it sheds dust on our furniture. We already have a plug-in air filter that we placed near the wall, but I think sealing the brick would help. The wall is not crumbling apart. It is a typical 100+ year-old brick wall that was exposed for aesthetic reasons on one side of our living room.Question: will this type of alteration put us at greater risk of a rent increase? I am guessing this could possibly qualify as an individual apartment improvement (IAI), which is a popular loophole for rent increases. It says the work must be done by a licensed contractor. Maybe if I offer to pay for the supplies and do it myself that would help get around this? Our landlord could always reject the alteration request or insist that we not do the work ourselves and have one of his staff do it instead. I found a product by Radon called LastiSeal Brick & Masonry Sealer that costs less than $100 and am comfortable doing the work myself if he grants permission. I initially always offer to do repairs myself to encourage a good relationship, but in this case, it may also help us avoid an IAI.I am trying to understand if I am putting us at risk for a monthly increase over something that is not completely necessary to have done."
Attempting to break my lease,"My apartment has been a nightmare since i moved in 6 months ago right off the bat i had faults in the apartment that have not been taken care of for months even after multiple service requests  (such as very low hot water, inresponsive water controls, broken light fixtures), currently all have been fixed after i had to threaten to sue. Today 4/28 my upstairs neighbor's shower had a hole and all the water leaked into my apartment. When i contacted the management office they checked upstairs and told me ""they have a hole in their shower they made a service request for it yesterday or today"" i have no damages to my items and they sucked up all the water although now i am left with a loud fan and dehumidifier to get any moisture left in the carpet. To break my lease I'd have to pay two months rent is there anything i can do in this situation to possibly get that reduced?"
"Texting, right to privacy","Do people have a right to privacy legally when texting with other people?For example, if I am having a conversation via text with a friend, and their partner reads through the texts without permission, is that legal?Given the “recorded nature” of written word, would it potentially be illegal for them to read texts if neither party consented?

Question about contract allowance or not,"Please note before reading this, this is not discussing a lawsuit against doordash, I have no interest in suing doordash, this is a question about an arguement between reddit users, that are all drivers, not lawyers, and I want to know if I am right or the people arguing with me are right.United States,Here is the conflict. Someone asked if they could give out business cards for their cousins/friends etc when they dropped off doordash orders.Here are the 2 applicable parts of the independant contractors agreement with doordash, and I will highlight the important lines.II.4 As an independent business enterprise, CONTRACTOR retains the right to perform services (whether delivery services or other services) for other businesses, and CONTRACTOR represents that they advertise and hold themself out to the general public as a separately established business. The parties recognize that they are or may be engaged in similar arrangements with other businesses to supply the same or similar services and nothing in this Agreement shall prevent CONTRACTOR or DOORDASH from doing business with others. DOORDASH does not have the right to restrict CONTRACTOR from performing services for CONTRACTOR’s own business, other businesses, customers, or consumers at any time, even if such business directly competes with DOORDASH, and even during the time CONTRACTOR is logged into the DOORDASH platform so long as such services do not otherwise violate this agreement. CONTRACTOR’s right to compete with DOORDASH, or perform services for businesses that compete with DOORDASH, will survive even after termination of this Agreement.Many arguments about it come from the following also in the ICA:II.9 By using the DOORDASH platform, CONTRACTOR also agrees to be bound by the DOORDASH Customer Terms of Service and that any breach of the DOORDASH Customer Terms of Service will be considered a breach of this Agreement. However, to the extent that this Agreement and the DOORDASH Customer Terms of Service conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.The arguments state that since we have to agree with the customer terms of service, this applies:(From the Customer Terms of Service)4(f) You will not use the Services, or any content accessible through the Services, for any commercial purpose, including but not limited to contacting, advertising to, soliciting or selling to, any Merchant, User or Contractor, unless DoorDash has given you prior permission to do so in writing."
At what point does probable cause become enough for a warrant or arrest?,"You can buy a ski mask legally, you can buy lock picks legally, you can even get guns legally. However I feel like if you have all 3 in your trunk together its a bit suspicious.

How to get a collection company to mail a bill,"I was in hospital three years ago. We paid all the bills. The hospital says we paid all the bills. Yet, there is this... supposedly legitimate... company, spoofing numbers, calling every day, to collect on the ""unpaid"" bills.I picked up one time, to see what they had to say. They had all of my records, information, etc. and told me they were acting on behalf of the hospital.I didn't confirm anything. I told them to check back with the hospital or mail me a bill.It's literally been 2.5years of daily spoofed calls. No mail. Hospital confirmed that everything was paid.How do I stop this?"

Child being bullied/cyberbullied and harassed. how to proceed?,"My child has been getting bullied at our public school for quite a few months now. I've talked about this to the school and brought it to both the administration's and teachers attention on multiple occasions. All in all it has been dismissed and the blame has been put on my child instead of addressing this with the other students. Recently over break and even on a day my child wasn't in school the harassment has become cyber bullying to a degree I cannot let my child have access to my phone (she doesn't have her own phone, so these kids have my number and text her seeming to forget she doesn't have her own phone). I've reported it to the schools public hot line but even today with her being absent they tried to harass her by calling and sending a slew of messages.Frankly I am done, and I have requested a meeting at the school about it as well, but I am wondering if there is any legal action I can take, and how I would take it? Cyberbullying is taken up with law enforcement here and considered very serious. My state acknowledges it as something that holds legal ramifications."

Any legal advice? Please help,"Ok so this is a rollercoaster of a story so please bear with me. I am an FSU student living off campus. On Tuesday, a shootout happened in front of my apartment, resulting in my car being wrecked by the car that was shooting and being shot at. When I came out of my apartment there was a blood trail leading to my doorstep, which is on the second floor of the apartment building. The following day I asked management if I can leave my car where it is until an adjuster takes it away the next day (it’s not obstructing the driveway or the sidewalk, it’s only taking up 2 parking spots rather than 1) and they said it is fine. The next day while I am on campus I get a text from my neighbor saying my car is being towed by management along with his and another neighbors (all 3 of our cars got wrecked by a chain collision when the shooters car hit mine). My car ended up being the only car towed bc I wasn’t there to fight my case unlike my neighbors. Now this morning, there was yet another shootout right in front of my apartment that happened around 4 am.Now I know this is very watered down version of the whole situation but I want to know if there is any type of legal action I can charge against anyone. This has left me with a great inconvenience, having to temporarily move on campus to be able to continue my classes but still paying rent in the place that was not able to provide security twice in a span of a week. (Not even including the day before the shootout when there were a couple shots fired and no police arrived on scene even after calls to them), and left with no transportation for a couple months at least until the insurance claim is settled. And many more unexpected expenses that I now have to deal with. And also add the mental hard it caused bc the shootout happened 15 minutes before I arrived home, where I avoided waiting those 15 minutes in cvs after getting my Covid vaccine shot, luckily avoiding being in the middle of the shootout, and the mental damage that comes with having blood trails leading to my front door and having a guy yelling that he’s been shot right i outside of it.Please let me know because I feel like there is but my knowledge of law is pretty low and I wouldn’t now where to attack this situation."
Father and Firearms,"Hi! Hopefully I can gain some insight on how to handle this situation. In October my father had a hemorrhagic stroke. They didn’t think he would survive. Thankfully he did. After rehab and hiring aids to assist he is back at home with mom.In December he fell and hit his head. Caused brain bleeding again. Due to Covid and his unwillingness to wait for a nurse and confusion they asked a family member to stay with him in the hospital. I stayed for two days and nights and it was continuous batshit crazy. He thought he was in a POW camp. Very delusional. Before he went home, I went first and removed all of his firearms, knives and ammunition.After returning home from the hospital he seems mostly normal now.  However, I don’t want intend to return the firearms as he does have some bouts of confusion. He is becoming more insistent that I return the firearms. I just can’t. He also isn’t going to drop it as the firearms are very much s part of his identity.I don’t think I have the legal authority to hold them, but returning them wouldn’t be ethical. If the brain bleed were to suddenly occur again he could because me very delusional again. Any suggestions on how to proceed?*Also, my mother agreed to the removal but now is agreeing that they should be returned. They are both 78 years old. She has been in denial about his overall condition. If he seems fine, she assumes he is."

Selling Assets Preemptively to Avoid Upcoming Legal Judgment - How Can I Stop It?,"Hi folks. I'm in civil litigation with another party regarding fraud and other misrepresentations performed by the other party. We (my attorney and I) have pretty damning evidence proving the other person's wrongdoing, along with recorded proof that he has committed perjury throughout the lawsuit and in his deposition. All in all I think we have about as strong a legal case (along with strong evidence to back it up) as anyone could ask for, and my chances of winning the case are probably very high.Now as part of the Discovery process we have had to share our evidences, and the other party now knows that I have them on record lying about everything and committing perjury...and they surely realize that their chances of winning the lawsuit are very low. This person has a history of shady and illegal activity, but this is the first time they have actually been caught in the act.The challenge I have now, is that given the shady history of him and his family, how can I prevent the other party from selling off their assets (home, etc) such that they would become judgment proof? The trial was already supposed to have taken place, but with the backlog of cases due to Covid they were able to get a continuance to push it back yet another 8 months (the case has been outstanding for over 2 years already). Since they now know how strong the case is against them, I suspect they will be spending these 8 months trying to sell off their assets.So my question is: What can be done to prevent someone from being able to sell off assets preemptively, and become judgment proof? My understanding is that I can't file to put a lien on their property, as doing so prior to having a court order/judgement would be illegal.Any thoughts/suggestions? I sincerely appreciate your help!"

Does the law firm have a hidden agenda after contacting us?! I don’t think there’s a lawsuit possible.,My daughter(18) went to a party three months ago. The party had the proper permits and everything from the city and the police department. The only thing police specifically stated was that the party must have officers there to check everyone for contraband and weapons before they could enter.Well somehow guns got into the party and they were shot off. Multiple people got hit and a handful died from it. Luckily my daughter barely survived after getting shot in the head. Yet she’ll forever have a lifetime of doctor visits with specialist a neurologist due to the place where she was shot(if they attempt to remove the bullet she will die).A “famous” law-firm in the big city a town over said there could potentially be a case against the police department since it’s been proven somehow that the women going into the party’s weren’t being searched and later on not contacting us about information with the case. Idk if any of that is true but they offered to take on the case we wouldn’t have to pay them anything until they win and they’d like to get 40% of whatever it is.I have my doubts on there being an actual case against the police department or that they expect us to not have to pay them anything even if it takes years until we win.I guess I just need some others thoughts on the situation and I understand the insight on the situation should be taken with a grain of salt. Thank you.

Texas overhead power line easement,"My friend owns about 10 acres near New Boston, Tx.

Remote Working Termination Question,"1400 employee professional services company based in Texas employs several people who are 100% remote workers in random states, they do not report to offices. I lived in Texas and reported to the head office for over 3 years, but needed to move to Ohio for personal reasons. I requested remote privileges and honestly did not see it being an issue, my boss agreed. Company denied request due to corporate policy that employees working in the corporate sector may not be 100% remote, though employees in the production sectors are allowed. Now they've forced my boss to seek and hire a replacement for me, who starts this month. Once they start and my bosses are satisfied that this person can take over my position (management in IT department), they will terminate my employment. They've implied that I will be expected to train my replacement and have offered no severance. I did request severance since I feel it is rude to expect me to train my replacement knowing they will terminate me (i.e. loyalty goes both ways).I know that Texas is a right to work state, but recently I heard that the company declined to terminate an inept employee against management recommendations due to the fact that the employee is over 55 and hispanic, and they wanted to avoid a lawsuit. I don't think I'm being discriminated against due to my race (Caucasian) or gender (female) or age (30s) in this case, but it got me thinking that if I were hispanic or older, would they fire me? Nobody can really prove that, I suppose, but I do feel discriminated against and as if I (and everyone else working in corporate) are ""less than"" because I'm being fired due to wanting what others are already doing (working remote). To be clear, my boss told me in writing my termination is not due to performance (and routinely states that I am an A player) and I know that he doesn't want to terminate me; he is not being given an option. This policy didn't exist when I was hired; remote working didn't really become a visible topic at the company until covid.I'm curious what your opinions are about this practice."

He sent some of my things with his mom (he offered, I didn’t want to bc his mom is not one who does favors with a good intent but accepted bc he said it was my Apple Watch, plants, and a small box of clothes he sent more than that without letting me know including things I was going to donate so sending them was a literal waste but then didn’t send things that were convenient for him to keep was then told I was ungrateful and that his mom didn’t even want to bring me my plants…okay?). The problem is I bought the furniture, and majority of the home essentials. I figured he’d use them until he decided to move out then I’d pick them up with the rest of my stuff and sell the furniture, after making it clear he didn’t want “my” stuff in his apartment I want to get my things and not deal with this anymore but now he’s saying he’s keeping the furniture and shipping my things to me (which again I bought the furniture and I left my bike there and glassware so shipping will obviously not be an option). I want my things back I have an older friend who is suggesting taking him to small claims court if he doesn’t give me my things bc the furniture is quality and not expensive but of value and the bike is pricey but honestly I don’t see myself doing that. Will the apartment complex let me into the apartment if I ask? I’m on the lease and I don’t think they know I’m no longer living there. I also contributed a large amount to the security deposit but by the way he’s been acting I doubt I’ll be seeing any of that anymore. I know there are obviously a lot of mistakes made here, being over him has made me see where I should’ve protected my own interests more and that trusting all would be amicable was a miscalculation on my part, lesson learned for the future but I need advice on how to handle this so that I can avoid some more regrets down the road. Thank you for taking the time to read this and any advice you might have is greatly appreciated."

Need advice on moving out of an apartment that the landlord is trying to get me to sign a lease for.,"Okay so this place is… not the best to say the least. I have had 90% of my windows broken for several years despite many attempts at fixing them for an example. Long story short, I am moving out on 4/2/22 (Saturday). My landlord has requested that at time of move out, I sign a lease for the time that I lived there since they “cannot find a copy of my lease”. She said it was for refinance purposes. It sounds sketchy as hell but also I don’t know much about refinancing… wondering what I should do and how I should tell her no if I need to. Thanks!"
I imagine it's illegal but woudl there ever be a justification for putting a recording device on your kid?,"This is a concern many minorities have is teachers being racist towards their kids, or somehow indoctrinating them.This is abizarre question and I dont have kids myself, but thinking about a situation with my nephew in TX.

Though, I have to do an actual name change.So, we married in France May of 2016. So, this May will mark 5 years. Our marriage cert is French.We currently live in California.I'd like to know what my options are for name change. Reading around I saw there is a change through marriage and a standard name change. I'd like to go the least expensive route, which I assume is the name change through marriage. However, I don't know how my situation factors into this (having waited this long and our certs being in French).Lastly, we have an international trip planned for the end of July.

Does the ADA require a restaurant to let customers with medical needs to bring their own food?,"Our kid who has Celiac disease was invited to a birthday party at a restaurant that our family does not believe can safely provide a gluten-free meal that will not make him sick.With Celiac disease, even a small amount of gluten-containing ingredients or cross-contamination can make the person sick.Examples of unsafe foods would include: French fries made in the same fryer as breaded items, or anything made in a kitchen with wheat flour in the air (e.g. Pizza restaurants that make their own crust).  Also, restaurants that don't research their ingredients thoroughly, or train their staff on proper cooking protocols.Some restaurants invest in the time, training, and facilities to be able to safely serve Gluten Free (GF) food. Other restaurants either don't know, can't, or don't want to bother.Usually, we would just avoid most restaurants, sticking to a few we know are safe, but in this case our son is invited to a birthday party. Most restaurants don't allow outside food, but would this be a disability that they legally have to accommodate, if we want him to bring take-out food from another restaurant that we do trust?"
"Vehicle was broken into and trashed, what would be a normal amount of restitution to ask for?","I’ve already finished everything so this isn’t actually asking any specific legal advice, I’m just curious.My vehicle was broken into (technically just the door was opened, since I stupidly left it unlocked) and the interior was gone through, stuff was just kinda recklessly thrown around, they were probably looking for money or valuables. I had $20 in cash that I kept in the center console to give to local homeless people, but that was the only thing taken.Because of this (and a different theft, where my electric scooter was stolen) my partner and I decided to move. Because of the timing of the move, we incurred a lot of extra fees.I guess I’m just curious how much would be ‘normal’ to ask as far as restitution. I just listed out what I thought were direct costs to me for the burglary, and including the move. It felt kind of excessive though, since no one was hurt and barely anything was actually taken."
Are the Texas transgender lawsuits currently occurring legal?,"Greg Abbott recently made news for his announcement of his intention to see parents whose children were given gender-affirming care prosecuted for child abuse. His logic, apparently, is that such care violates a child's fourteenth amendment rights, citing Skinner v. Oklahoma, and noting that since this type of care results in a loss of fertility that the child cannot consent to, it therefore falls into the real of child abuse. Is this kind of conclusion legally justified?"

The investigation is opened up because the victim’s wife has, what she believes, is evidence of her husband recording fellow officers and planning to report them for abuse of power/racial discrimination.Thank you for any advice you can offer!"

Asset ownership,"I went into a partnership with some friends and started a company.

As such, if I were to leave, could I claim ownership and take the assets with me, or would they remain with the company?Also I don’t care to continue and don’t care to regain my investment, is there something special I need to do with my equity or can I just sign it away?"

"For a book, can self defense be premeditated?","I'm writing a book and one of the storylines revolves around a group of children that escape an abusive home. One of them is older than the rest and subject to sexual abuse. They learn the code to the safe where the abuser keeps his gun, and at some point go and fetch the gun and shoot the abuser. And 15 years later end up confessing what happened. On the one hand I am aware that US law does allow for the use of deadly force to protect oneself and or others, however the firearm is not within grabbing distance nor does this happen during an altercation, it happens because the individual believes it to be the only way to be safe. It is however fairly calculated and premeditated. What are the legal charges? Would it have to go to trial to establish  motive and circumstances? What would the best case (even if very unlikely) outcome be for this individual? They're about 13 at the time of the killing. The evidence would be limited, however the individual has already signed a confession. The rest of the story is not about anything to do with crime or the justice system but I would like to make that part as ""plausible"" as possible at the very least rather than just making up jibberish. Any advice on this example or places I might be able to find a consult or ways to research this effectively would be very much appreciated."
Questions about asset seizure,"Hey guys, so I'm in the process of buying a house from my cousin, and I'm a little concerned about a few issues that have arisen. For a little background, the house originally belonged to my aunt (her mother). She passed away and there is apparently a paper that says it was supposed to go to her dad if something happened to her. Well her dad was put into a care facility for alzheimers (before her passing), and the state has seized his truck for assets. My cousins lawyer has assured us that everything will be fine and they will proceed with the sale and put the proceeds into an account to deal with later. But I'm worried that If i proceed and there is any issues, the state may attempt to take my future house for assets as well. I would appreciate any advice on what to do. Thanks everyone!"

Pennsylvania: Kicking out a roommates friends?,"So I live in a place with a roommate.  We’re both on the lease and both pay half the rent and things like that. Well a few months ago, we had a falling out and kinda hate each other now.  Our lease ends soon and we are both moving away luckily so that’s not a problem.  The problem though, is that my roommate has gotten hostile and passive aggressive around me all the time and most recently has started inviting friends over all the time and being loud, exclusively when I’m sleeping (I work nights, so midday) on days where I work that night.  It’s never enough to be a noise disturbance to neighbors especially since it’s mid afternoon usually, but it’s very disruptive to my sleep and ability to work.My question is if I am legally allowed to kick out their friends.  Obviously I can’t make my roommate leave since they are on the lease and all and it would be moot since the notice time would be longer than the time we have left before we move.  But their friends don’t live with us, and aren’t on the lease.  They are only there to visit, for less than 24 hours at a time, and have a place to go home to.  So it wouldn’t be an eviction or anything.Normally if I lived alone, if a friend came over and I wanted them out I could kick them out and if they refused I’m fairly certain it would start elevating to the point of trespassing?  Would that still apply if my roommate is the one letting them in?  What can I do to get these people out of my house so I can get some sleep?"

What do therapist have to report?,"Hi, I live in Kansas, and I was hoping to get some clarification about some legal rules about what therapist are supposed to report. My dad was in a car accident when I was about 7 and it changed his behavior for a amount of years. During those years he physically abused me and my siblings. I want to talk to a therapist about it but I am worried that they would have to report it. I don’t want to report it because I have a little sister who is 10. He has never physically abused her because he is alum a better state of mind. So I guess my question is if someone committed abuse while suffering from a mental condition but they have since recovered will they still be considered a danger to others?"

"If Biden disagrees with the death penalty, why did his administration defend Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's sentence?","Note: If this would be better posted on another subreddit, let me know.Some articles on the matter: Reuters, AP, ESPNNow, I understand that the DOJ is not arguing about the punishment, but arguing that the Appeals Court was incorrect in it's determination that the trial was unfair, hence vacating some of the District Court's sentences. There was a legitimate argument that the jurors may have been biased, and the judge chose to withhold could have affected the jurors' decision, and hence, their verdict.So why fight the reversal? He wouldn't go free, he would just be resentenced.Is it more about a legal power dynamic? What would that be?I'm confused because it seems like if you don't support the death penalty, you would just let the resentencing occur."
Apartment in Indiana,"Hey everyone,I moved out over a month ago and the old complex said they had thirty days to present a list of charges. As i remember it is only like 2 weeks.

I feel like I’ve really screwed up,"Please, I need some legal advice. I was supposed to pet sit this puppy but now I’m starting to believe I was scammed. And now I’m freaking out. I think I got a fake check that I deposited unknowingly. For a lot of money. And since the funds haven’t been made even partially available yet, the person I received the check from wants to cancel and send a smaller amount.Context: I saw this ad to dog sit a chihuahua on Facebook. I needed some cash due to being between jobs and they were willing to pay a lot for an extended period of time. Then I discovered they were out of town for work and would need to send the puppy over to stay at my home. They showed me a screenshot of their account and they definitely had the funds. The first red flag though is when he said he’d send me money to pay the delivery service. He said it’s because my name is there to receive the puppy, which means I’m the one ordering the service. Okay, whatever. But I get the check, which is way more than I thought it would be, and I deposit it via mobile yesterday. But today the funds aren’t even partially available. That’s red flag 2, I feel that it’s being put on hold but the person who sent the check seems eager to cancel it to send a smaller (still large) amount. Red flag 3, I keep stating I want to talk with my bank and he keeps trying to rush the cancelation telling me that he knows what he’s doing.So then I take a closer look at the check and start doing my own research and I think the check is printed and fake! And that’s really scaring me because I’m just starting to get my life in order and I feel like it’s all about to be destroyed because of money I can’t pay leaving my account and being held accountable for fraudulent activity I wasn’t aware of. Im in a panic. Even if the funds came through, I am not going to use them out of fear of the canceling. But even if I don’t use them, am I still liable to pay it back if the check finally bounces? Am I going to face legal consequences and tons of fees because I was scammed? I just started a good paying job, I have to care for my disabled fiancé and our pets/his service dog in training, I have to pay my rent, my bills, etc. I was just beginning my life. Im scared that this might end it faster than I can blink…. What do I do? Please help"

The dentist submitted her x rays and they're basically saying her teeth weren't bad enough? How the fuck can they be more qualified to make that judgement than multiple actual dentists?"
Why is it legal to own a gun but not a sword?,"So I’ve just wondered for a long time why guns are allowed in the US but not swords? I know swords aren’t practical at all. But it’s not like they’re more dangerous. My first post, wasn’t sure where to ask it. Just curious :)"
Car Accident Insurance rental reimbursement,"Got into an accident a few months back. Not at fault. Was hit from behind in stop and go traffic.dealing directly with other drivers' insurance.Car (2020 model with 5k miles) had lots of damage. The insurance towed it to a dealer (in their network).Insurance told me to get rental and pay for it which they would reimburse later. So, I asked them for how long they will cover for rental. And the insurance agent told me until the car's fixed.Car is still at dealer. I asked insurance for updates on the car. They told me to contact dealer directly. I kept in touch weekly. Dealer is waiting for parts.I still have rental car. Since the rental cost piled up, I submitted the invoice to insurance to reimburse.They only only sent a check for 1/3 (third) of the invoice and now refuse to reimburse anymore.I have it in writing (email) from them saying they will reimburse rental until the car's fixed.What can I do to get them to reimburse me the cost of rental?Please help."
"I think my landlord might be pulling a fast one, what do I do?",I have just noticed I haven't been sent a bill for the electric. When I moved in and tried to set one up I didn't have access to the meter and the landlord oddly didn't want me accessing it.Thinking about it the basement apartment isn't up for rent. One of the flats is owned by another landlord. The building wasn't originally designed to be mutable flats but atached houses.When I look up his company online all I can find is he owns property's and that's it.The thing that set off my suspicion is the meters and cables look a little fly tip junk from a hole in the floor. All different types of meters.Who's paying for electric? If he's leaching electric who's liable for its use. If I don't have access to set up a supplier how am I able to monitor my usage or is it going to be a unknown amount bill I will have to pay.Any advice would help.

Moving savings from Europe to US. What is the legal non-suspicious way?,"I have a bank account in a European bank with about $50k in savings. I will be moving back to the US soon, and I want to transfer my funds to my US bank account.I'm a US citizen, and I've filed US taxes every year. But I've earned less that threshold for dual-taxing, so I only paid taxes on it in Europe, not the US. My US income looks like I've earned 0 since I moved here.How do I move the money without arousing suspicion? Just one big transfer? Is there a tax form I should fill out?I'll probably be moving to WA."
Towing Conundrum,"Hey everyone,I have  been having an interesting experience with a towing company. My car has been  consistently getting towed from my apartment complexe's parking lot once a week. Interestingly they always  return the  car to my apartment within an hour and a half  with no request for payment or even notification my car has been towed. I have checked with my local police department and they have  no records of the car every  being towed. I almost caught them last  time the car was towed. It's a confusing situation, any  suggestions on what I  should do next would be appreciated."
Is it the businesses responsibility to notify the customer of their prices? Or is it the customers responsibility to ask what the prices are?,"I'm thinking about when there is no price listed for something. Let's say the customer orders something that doesn't have a posted price and then gets it. Then the business charges the credit card some amount that the customer thinks is too high or not correct. But of course how could the customer know what the correct price is without ever knowing seeing the price? I know the customer is stupid for not asking, but I'm wondering about this from a legal perspective."
I Believe my old job might be stealing from people,Ok so I have a taxes question if anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it. I worked for a decently sized business in Texas. When I started all the new hires would fill out our tax information in a group with HR telling what to select. I quit in December so I received a full W2. After I entered my new jobs W2 I was getting roughly $800. When I my old jobs W2 I owed $400. My old job said I and a lot of other people filled out the forms wrong. My question is what could I have done to possibly mess this bad or was it my old jobs mess up?
Barred from a city property.,"So…this is the condensed version of what occurred.  I worked at a municipal golf course for about 13 months from summer 20 to summer 21.  It started out good.  My boss told me that I was the best help he (20+yr career)ever hired.  During my employment my alcoholism and marijuana usage started to effect my performance and my personal life.  I took a leave of absence to attend a 26 day rehab program.  My boss told me that I would have a job once I returned and he delivered on that promise.  When I came back to work, I returned to top form and he told me as much.  Unfortunately, my marriage took a hit as a result of my actions prior to rehab and had all the signs of divorce.  I knew I couldn’t support myself on 9$/hr so I left the job on good terms and moved to the town over to attend CDL school.  A few weeks after I quit, I signed up to play in a weekend tournament and was taken off the tee sheet.  Come to find out, my boss has gotten lazy with the day’s deposits and had been stuffing them away in his desk instead of taking them to the bank.  After I had left, he had decided to deposit all the days earnings that had piled up in his desk.  There was approximately 50,000$ missing.  He told the head pro and immediately I became the one and only suspect.  My boss tried to convince the head pro that he didn’t think I was the thief but the HP wouldn’t listen.  Since there was no camera in the office, there was no proof that I was involved.  I was banned from playing at the course.  It was determined that they wouldn’t seek legal recourse and that I needed to stay away.I guess I should be happy that I’m not in a fight for my freedom but the ban effectively took away my hobby and most of my social interaction.  There aren’t many courses close to my house and all of my friends play at this course. Anyone with 5 mins of unsupervised access to the office could have taken the money and that is a long list of people. I’m not real sure how long the theft went on but I was lead to believe is was between the time that I was hired and my rehab stint.I guess I’m posting this to determine if this ban is enforceable given the circumstances.  Also, what steps could I take to fight it if I chose to do so?"
Are Balisongs Illegal in Washington state,"I've recently picked up Balisong flipping as a hobby, currently I use a trainer but I would love to own a live blade at some point. I am not really even looking to edc I just have found Washington knife laws to be very vague, it says nearly anything is lawful to carry openly as long as there is no ill intent. Here's where it gets confusing, it seems anything considered a switchblade is illegal explicitly. Yet Stilettos are legal (which are a spring release knife,) I've seen some states describe balisongs as a switchblade because gravity knives fall under that category, when they have no release mechanism and even using gravity is something you can do to open a pocket knife. I've taken the mindset at this point its kind of don't ask don't tell and it may be confiscated, but if I own one am I breaking the law and will I get into legal trouble if I pocket clip carry? Thanks for the help!"

What should my friend do?,"Last year, my friend got into an car accident. A kid clipped my friend’s car.

How exactly can the us prosecute narcotics crimes that happen in different countries with no direct conspiracy to the United States?,"I was reading an indictment of a Guatemalan national, and the indictment had no indication that any crime had been committed that involved the United States, just that cocaine and heroin had been moved from Guatemala to Belize where it was sold to another party that wasn’t listed on the indictment so I’m assuming they’re unknown.  There’s no indication that any of the merchandise actually made it to America, so why were they convicted of conspiracy in America?"

Is Travelocity required to give me credit they mistakenly promised me?,"I cancelled a flight in 2021 and confirmed before doing so that I would get a flight credit.

My lawyer died...how do I go about getting any legal records he may have had on file?,"I found out today that my family's longtime immigration lawyer passed away last July. We live across the country and haven't needed any services for a few months so it makes sense that we hadn't heard, but I am heartbroken - he was so helpful and walked us through many major life changes/stressful situations and was only 51!Anyway - should we be concerned with collecting any legal records that he may have had on site for continuity of our case?

Can the government take your kids away if you don't change them?,"Context: I was a goth as a teen. I listen to explicit rock music which my parents gave me permission to listen to, I also watched horror films since that was what my mom and dad liked and they let me watch them.Anyways. When I was 14 I had my first suicide attempt, and had to go to a hospital for it.My mom's sister in law, (I don't like to call her ""aunt"" cause of trauma she's caused me and my family), said to my mom if they didn't ""change"" me, i.e stop me from being goth, forbid me from listening to that music and watching horror movies, that the state will take me away. Like put me in foster care and yadda yadda.According to my mother's sister in law , if you don't change your child's personality after a suicide attempt then the government will take the child away from the parents and put them in foster care.Is this true or was my mom's in law just fear mongering my mom to change what she hated about me? Since she never liked the way my parents raised me. They were lenient about raising me and let me be me. She was almost a dictator to her kids, they weren't even allowed to watch MTV for gods sake.Sorry to go off but I need to know this. Cause ever since this happened, I've been wondering."

Started as Sole Proprietor then became LLC (US),"Hello. I started my business as a sole proprietor, let's call it Chocolate Teapot, and was given an EIN to use from the IRS.

In jail, they searched me - this included a female officer forcing me to take all clothes off despite me stating multiple times I do not consent to it, and squat while being naked.

"[FL] Understanding the ""20 days to inform a public-employee of your intent to sue""","TL,DR? I'm uncertain ""When the clock starts"" for this ""20 day notification"", I read it somewhere but cannot find it now however it stated that public employees (at least here in FL) are to be notified within 20 days of your intent to sue.  I'm left puzzled and worried, because I don't have any concrete ""day of malpractice"", what happened to me occurred over nearly 3 dozen visits, as 3 of the staff dentists would take turns giving me exorbitantly oversized fillings (all of which are failed now, just 1yr later)  So I'm not even positive if my suit should be against the dentists (and their assistants?) who worked on me, as a 'group', or against the dental clinic itself.  Also since the work was done through most of 2021, there was no ""hard date"" of malpractice.How would you guys see this?  Any chance medical/dental stuff may be exempt from this 20 day thing?Thanks a lot for any help understanding this, I feel like I should be rushing but, at the same time, I am scared to let them know I have sought a 2nd-opinion, they think I'm VERY ignorant about just how bad things are, so *for now* since I don't have insurance and can't know if I'll find an attorney, I may need to be begging these same people ""Please re-check, I have a suspicion that 16 teeth you put fillings into are ALL infgected, every single one, can we get going on that?"" but that basically requires them acknowledging that all the work last year was pointless, I - and they - are ""between a rock & a hard place"" on this one (the clinic folk that I see *now* are not so bad, it was the first 2/3rds of treatment, when I was going to a closer location - where it was spanish-speaking and english as 2nd-language for clients only - I believe the damage was done, so to speak, by the time I finally requested to the administrator that I be moved to a facility where I can speak clearly with the dentist because the dentist that day had removed a tooth I did NOT expect (and it was a visible tooth when I smile....thought he was pulling the one beside it/rear of it, a tooth that was closer to molar area and also pulled shortly thereafter, but the miscommunication scared me.  Nevermind that, on multiple occasions, I'd sit down & the dentist would ask *ME* ""what do you wanna do today?"" and I'd have this bewildered look on my face like ""you're the professional, you know the plan you guys have me on for fillings + partials to cover what you can't filll, YOU should know which the next most-appropriate is!"" lol just insane!Unsure when the 20d could start, I mean I saw a private dentist for a 2nd opinion >20d ago, and subsequently setup a consultation with my dentist at the clinic (the one I was transferred to) wherein - if you can even believe this - he literally tells me he does NOT believe I have ANY chance of actually getting my partials....the partial dentures that he put me on the waiting-list for back in Nov., and had told me I was ready-for & just needed to come for my cleanings.... After seeing the private dentist & learning that every single filling (16!!) was bad, and that this compromised the requisite teeth for anchoring partials properly, I went into the consultation with my clinic-dentist expecting him to keep up his lies but was astounded when he basically tells me ""Yeah she [partials-woman] will never do your partials, she requires far too perfect of a mouth and the fillings you have preclude this"", now I was told this by the 2nd-opinion private dentist, but for my  clinic dentist to tell it to me was mind-boggling, I asked him ""Wait so, after waiting months on this waiting list, and finally getting called to go to that facility to get my partials, I would have been told an unequivocal No by the woman there?"" and he replies ""Yes""!!!!!  He furthermore tells me that all the composite filler that I'd gotten for about 95% of the time with this clinic was ""very soft, very short lived"", a few years lifespan but not even half-decade!!  I was astounded I had only gone in for a painful molar I had no idea I had cavities but figured ""get fillings when dentist advises"", did not think a year later that I'd b'e losing every tooth that they filled because their fillings all (100%) failed!!"

Signed contract for solar panels under false pretenses,"My parents signed a contract with a company for solar panels on our house. In their correspondences with the companies that they researched they were adamant on getting micro inverters so that if one panel breaks the others still work. The alternative is to have only one mega inverter and if that breaks then the whole system shuts down.My dad asked through email to include the micro inverter in the contract. We installed the panels back in October and recently (in January 2022) found out that none of it is working at all. My dad found out that it’s because the solar panels aren’t micro inverters they have a mega inverter instead and that the whole system died and never worked.The reason why it’s better to have micro inverter than mega is because if it breaks you can have the other panels still working, but when the mega breaks you have to have the company fix it and that depends on if you have a warranty. The company doesn’t even provide/guarantee warranty.It turns out in the contract they wrote Micro inverter and next to it they wrote (“and comparable”). The company is arguing that they put something comparable to the micro inverter which is the mega inverter. It’s stupid because a mega inverter is not comparable to a micro inverter because it is something completely different that we never even wanted.Do we have a case here? It seems they lied and didn’t give us what we asked for during the negotiations and put a hidden word in the contract. It’s stupid because a mega converter isn’t even comparable to a micro inverter. My parents paid $20,000 for this and it doesn’t even work."

For context, this happened in Texas, and I’m a college student.At the beginning of the fall semester, I was walking out to run a few errands. I walked into the parking garage and noticed my truck was not where I left it. I told myself I must have parked on another floor and checked every level until I reached the roof. I double-checked the entire garage, triple-checked it, and quadruple-checked it. I had already called my apartment's towing company, and they told me that they hadn’t picked it up.I believed it was stolen, so I called the police to file a report and prepared to make the police report for the insurance claim (Another nightmare). Eventually, the police found my truck was under a lien. The thing is that my truck was paid off, and the title was under my name.I called the “lien holder ”/ loan holder, and a manager said the truck was sent to auction. After a bit of back and forth, they finally relented with the information and evidence I provided. My truck was delivered to one of their loan branches from another city.I got to the branch, and they told me they had no idea the truck about this mess (I highly doubt it). The loan branch also did not have any documents regarding this. I was only given a key to my truck, so I went to inspect it. As I opened the driver's door, I noticed a foul stench, grease stains all over the truck cloth, a hanging dashboard, and the brakes were feeling off. I called back the manager I spoke to earlier, and they said I would receive documents regarding this ordeal, but they never did arrive and stopped answering my calls.This ordeal infuriated me because I missed classes for a week, got in trouble at my job because I had to call in, and was put under a heavy financial strain. I want to do something about this, but I don’t know where to start or who to contact. I’m also broke, so I don’t know if I could even consult a lawyer. Any advice on where to start and help is much appreciated!"

Background check question,"For a background check, I'm being asked if there are any felonies or misdemeanors (if I plead guilty or been convicted, etc). This is the first time I've seen this as it's usually felony. I got a dui in IL 6 years ago. I plead guilty to the Class A misdemeanor. Ultimately I wasn't convicted because I filed an affidavit for supervision to have it dismissed after 1 year. I talked to my lawyer and he states the question they ask me is conflicting bc it asks to report if I pled guilty or conviction, but not to also not report anything that didn't result in a conviction. So I'm going to say no, I don't have a misdemeanor. He also stated if I can be candid with them, to do so. I'm a little worried it may just open a door that I don't really need to open.Any 2nd opinion would be great!Actual wording:Have you ever been convicted of, plead guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere, to a misdemeanor or felony? * *Do not report a record of any arrest, detention, process, diversion, supervision, adjudication or court disposition that was subject to the process and jurisdiction of a juvenile court. *Do not report a record of any conviction that has been sealed, expunged, statutorily eradicated, annulled, impounded, erased, dismissed, dismissed under a first offender’s law, pardoned by the Governor or which state law allows you to lawfully deny. *Do not report a record of any arrest, charge or detention that did not result in a conviction. *Do not report violations, infractions or summary offenses."

What makes pump and dump schemes illegal? [USA],"What exactly that the ""planners"" of a pump do is illegal? Where is the border between legal and illegal?For example, if you plainly state that the sole purpose is to get the price of a particular stock as high as possible, as many (large) discord/telegram servers do, but not give any false information about the stock/currency, would that be illegal? Do you need to have invested prior to the pump for it to be illegal?I'd like to state that I don't intend on using this information to pump and dump myself, quite the opposite.Thanks in advance!"

"I want my son to own the house he grew up in, with minimal tax consequences","I'm hoping I'll find someone specialized in Texas real estate law and tax laws.  I'm not sure where else to ask.My wife and I bought this house in 2011 with a VA loan, and we are about $60k from paying it off.  Our son is grown and making good money.  My wife has left the country with no plans to return.  I currently occupy the house with my son.  I want to transfer ownership of the house to my son, so that I can use my VA loan to buy another house.  He has saved a decent amount of cash to make that easier.  My wife has no objections.  After the house is no longer in our names, we'll have no community property, and can file a very simple divorce.My concern is that I don't want my son to have to pay a large tax bill for receiving a gift.  What can you advise?"

Did my husband violate his restraining order?,"My husband currently has a restraining order with peaceful contact with his 14yr old daughter. He has barely seen her in the last 6 years because the mom doesnt want her to have contact to get his side of things and to lose child support.  Now things are being said from his daughter that don't line up with the truth.  She claims that there was horrible abuse to the mom that she will never forgive her dad for which didn't happen. Before Christmas she contacted my 12 yr old daughter and said she randomly wanted to come by with her friend to visit the pets that she hasn't seen in forever and my 2 daughters. She was told when she came to the door by my daughter that her dad was going to be home any minute and that I told them that they should stay on the porch.  She came into the house anyway and we have this saved on the doorbell camera video. She was there 5 min before my husband came home.  His daughter ran to him and hugged him for a long time and they hung out for 45 min while he showed her around. Her friend had to leave and as they were leaving the cameras recorded her talking to her dad and hugging him. We decided to contact the mother through talking parents and she said she was aware of the visit after the fact but didn't know the dad was there. When we brought up the idea of making another visit, the mom said she had a very long talk to her daughter about how her dad could be in serious trouble if someone reports the visit because of the restraining order and how he could go to jail. Now the mom says that his daughter is not interested in having a relationship with him and he should leave her alone. Is this correct? Is he possibly in violation of she came by of her own will and we have it on video that it was peaceful?"
Liability waiver,"Let's imagine a hypothetical scenario in which my apartment needed to perform extensive repairs due to a water leak that happened seventeen days ago. They notify me that they are ready to proceed with repairs but need me to move my bookshelves, as well as my TV. Due to the TV being massive and mounted upon the wall, I am unable to move it and store it without paying professionals to assist me in doing so. Naturally, the property is unwilling to help me - financially or otherwise - to accommodate any such solution. The property's response is that I can either move the bookshelves and TV, or I can sign a waiver, releasing the contractors from any liability for damage that may occur to my property.What if, somehow, the signed waiver that I send back to the property contains wording stating that the contractors are indeed fully liable for any property they might damage - rather than the opposite?"
Landlord charging me to advertise his property,"Hi all,My partner and I are in a lease until June but just bought a house, so we will be leaving our current rental early in breaking our lease. We have informed our landlord, and we understand that we have an obligation to pay rent until June. We also understand that our landlord has a responsibility to mitigate damages. We have communicated, and he has said that he will advertise his house on Zillow, etc. to help get it rented ASAP.BUT, he has told us that we have to pay for all advertising of his house on these sites. He wants a total of ~$150 to post the house on various places. I suppose it makes sense for us to pay this even if we only get out of our lease for a month, but it strikes me as odd. Is it legal for him to ask this of us as per of his responsibility to mitigate damages?Thanks in advance!"
[California] Employer's forms for family leave do not match state law,"Hi all, I'm a full time employee with a large employer in California and have been with my employer for multiple years and am planning to apply for leave to care for a relative who recently suffered a serious injury.Part of the administrative process includes a google form that requires me to select that I am applying either a) for myself or b) for a parent, child, or spouse - however, under the California Family Rights Act, several other relatives are included, and I am applying for a different relative (grandparent) that is covered under the act. How should I best address this when completing the required documentation? Prior experiences with HR have already shown that they tend to try to deny leave for arbitrary reasons, so I'm trying to avoid any unnecessary headache while dealing with this difficult family situation."
Why aren’t apartment complexes required to be ADA compliant if they are a business?,"I was browsing Zillow and noticed most apartments have multiple stories and have no access to the second or third floor other than with stairs.

A company working for us hit my parked car.,"I work for a construction company who was having an excavation company do some work. One of the workers of that company backed into my parked car. I contacted the company and they said to give them a quote for the repair. I got a quote and sent it to them. They said they’ll write me a check. They show up with a check written to the collision shop for the estimate price. I told them no. Why do I want a check for an estimate price to the first shop I got a quote for. They called back and said they voided the check and that their insurance company will contact me. I asked him to just write the check out to my name I can go where I want, when I want, especially since that was one quote and they’re three months out. He said no the insurance company will handle it.  It’s been a week and I haven’t heard from the insurance company. I’ve called him twice since then and no answer. And this all happened three weeks ago. I’m not filing an insurance claim because my insurance will go up and I have to pay my deductible out-of-pocket. Plus they hit my PARKED car. Is this something I can take them to small claims for? How long am is supposed to wait for them to do something about it?"
Is it theoretically possible to agree on a contract where in breach a party goes to prison?,"So I'm watching this movie called What We Do In The Shadows, where a documentary crew follows vampires around with permission.Now what if the vampires gave the crew a contract of ""yes you can film us, but shcedule the release and any publicity of the documentary in no less than 50 years, otherwise go to prison, and be liable for any leaks"".

How would this be done in reality, as close as possible to how I envision it in this idea?"
"(FL) Malpractice lawyers and payment, questions on up-front versus ""only if you win"" compensation","I hear commercials shouting *""We don't get paid if you don't!1!1""* all the time, and had falsely assumed that, just because I'd suffered real damages, and there being such easy/clear causality between malpractice/not Standards-of-Care treatment and the damages, I'd have thought I'd be able to find such a lawyer, found out I was wrong!What kinds of cases, then, *do* get these ""plaintiff doesn't pay up front"" treatments?  Maybe it's gotta be $1M+ or 500k at least?  Maybe dental cases are ""more difficult"" and such attorneys dislike them in-general?Thanks for any insight, I just want to understand a little better because it looks like I'll spend '22 paying out of pocket to remove nearly half of my teeth, because - in '21 - I was dumb enough to get fillings and apparently I should've asked *""Will these fail in short-order?""*, but I didn't ask that and they did, and now they're *all* infected & need removal! Frustrating part is that I was told, like usual, *""They're all fine you're a-ok!""* not 1 whole week before I went and got 2nd opinions, both of which were nearly identical sadly: Every single one of the fillings (12) is infected & needs removal ASAP, and that the type of work was improper (both asked me who my dentist was in a manner of *""OMG who was it?!?""*)"

UK Question Second hand Van.,"We have a close friend who is a part time/hobbyist van convertor. Buys a van and converts the interior into a camper van. We teamed up with him to buy a van and convert it. He is not a mechanic but has done a great job on a few previous projects. He bought a van with a full MOT, he had it for 6 months and we showed interest in buying it. He had a new clutch fitted and started on the interior. His family is part of our close knit community, we have no reason to doubt him, we think he has been duped like we have. He had the van for 6 months to fix it up for us. He gave it to us despite the fact we have not paid the full amount, which we would have paid on completion of the interior. Just took it for it's MOT to find the previous owner had used expanding foam and paint to disguise large area's of rust and rot on essential parts of the van. Including the mounts for suspension and the sills. The MOT garage have said it is a write off, it cost us the best part of 4k. My question. The previous MOT garage, why did they not flag up these issues?  They took a lot longer than 2 years to become apparent, we are talking about serious rot that would take a lot longer than a year. They were there when the van went through its MOT a year ago. Can we pursue this with the previous garage that passed it despite these issues? I do understand sold as seen, I am 4k out of pocket due to others being unscrupulous and deliberately hiding faults. I am already resigned to the loss, just checking just in case. I run my own business which is seasonal, this is the first year in 15 years I have saved some money and I am pissed off that all of my hard work is going to be lost due to another person being fraudulent."

My car was towed and impounded by the city of Chicago but the website for tickets shows I don't have any,"So what happened was I'm an Uber driver, and my car was towed and impounded for tickets.However I was unable to look them up online and they are saying I have to go down in person to start a payment plan. It's a total of $4,000 I have been checking the site regularly anytime one of the speed cameras caught me. But it would never show tickets for my license plate or driver's license.Is this like a scam or something so the city can rack up tickets and then tow my car and force me to pay?I would have paid as I got the tickets I mean it just happens I drive about 12 hours a day and sometimes your mind slips and you go a little over the speed limit.My other question is has anyone else been through this payment plan process how much of the $4,000 will I have to put down?Will there be any other charges I should look out for?TLDR:My car was towed and I owe 4k in tickets but I never received any notice in mail and online site said there were no tickets."
Can I sue my uncle for wrongful death from COVID.,"This is a hypothetical question based on a real situation from someone I know. (No one actually died from Covid in the original scenario) and I will tell it from my perspective.So I have an uncle who, over Christmas time found out him and his children had Covid. Rather than tell everyone and skip out on the family Christmas get together, and lied saying they were fine. They took some cough and cold medicine before coming to make the symptoms seem less severe. And upon questioning stated they just had a cold. My wife and I were wearing masks except wen eating and have been vaccinated, but she still managed to catch covid, most likely from my uncle. (I'm still safe so far.) After the gathering we found out that they already knew they had covid prior to joining us, but didnt bother to tell usThat's all the details of the actual scenario.My question comes from if my wife, or children were to have caught covid from my uncle, and ended up dying. Would that be enough grounds for a civil lawsuit for wrongful death, or at least to pay the hospital bills or for lost wages due to missing work?I do know that in civil cases, the burden of proof is often much lower than a criminal case, but I was unable to find any precedent for similar types of cases. Was wondering if there is any insight?"

(A year before the rape, this guy broke into my house and attacked me. Totally random. No physical evidence. When he was arrested for the rape, I was flown in from Florida to NY to do a line up and a voice line up. Picked him out in both without a doubt in my mind. He was not prosecuted in my case. I’m still pissed that he wasn’t)"

My partner is being held in a Mexican psych facility against his will. What are my options?,"My partner was convinced to go to Mexico with his mother. They don't get along well as his family is Mormon and he has never agreed with their lifestyle and vice versa. If I can be as unbiased as possible, she is emotionally abusive and controls everyone in her life, besides my partner.Him and I have been together for almost a decade. She has never approved and thinks I'm a witch holding him with my powers. I always encouraged a relationship and told him to just grin and bear it because I thought he would regret it if he went no contact.After a series of bad choices and mishaps, we went to stay with his parents. She invited him to come to Mexico for a day, and I encouraged it, as per usual. Long story short, he didn't come home with herAlthough he did text me once and said, ""Mom is kidnapping me to a clinic in Aguascalientes. I love you,"" along with their location at that moment, I had no idea until she pulled into the driveway without him. This is mostly due to the fact that she told me outright on more than one occasion that they wre both on the way home, he simply wasn't feeling well. She also texted me from the number he was using at the time, pretending to be him and saying something similar (I know it was her bc it was broken english). A few times, she also texted me from the phone he used but it was simply a picture of their location. I figured he was not feeling well still, and decided to let him rest on the trip home.After talking it out, she said he would be gone up to 4 months. She told me i could take her car to visit the city where we were from and insisted I leave my pets and stuff behind. Within hours, she lied to my parents and essentially told them I stole her car. By the next day, she was saying she wanted nothing to do with me, and asked me to leave the tablet my partner and I bought in her car along with her car keys so she could go pick it up. She wanted the tablet so I couldn't have access to our bank accounts, since my partner - a disabled veteran medically retired from the military - receives a check every month. I thought that was bullshit because my partner would NEVER want them to have access to it over me, let alone want me to be left high and dry.It's been 4 months. I've heard NOTHING from him directly. His family claims he's not allowed to communicate, only his physhicatrist can. They have been allowed to send a short video or two and asked me to send one to them so they could forward it to the physician for my partner. On a few occasions, a staff-member has messaged me on FB. He swore me to secrecy and said he would lose his job, but it was implied that he gets along with my partner. (To me, since this place is very closed-off to everyone else, but he still reached out to me and risked it all just so my partner and I could commnicate, it means he thinks that my partner is different than the average patient they have there. He even called my SO his friend.)I have learned the followingHe will be there 6 months before he can leaveThis can change, because, in a letter my partner hand wrote and had the staff member send me pictures of, so I could show his parents, my partner said, ""they don't want to hear what i'm really thinking, and if I tell them, i'll be forced to stay longer.as per the employee and the letter my partner had him send, it's only his parents that can get him out. The employee told me even if i drove to Aguascalientes, his parents are the only ones who can get him out. And my partner's letter said that if they leave him in there 1 day over six months, they will never hear from him againHe has gained 60 pounds in 4 months. This along wiht his diagnosis, worries me. I have never heard any of his plethora of psych professionals mention anything close to this diagnosis, and it was always an issue that it seemed he had the OPPOSITE problem. I'm wondering if this diagnosis is because his mental health is actually deterioriating instead of getting better."

Ontario: Scheduling Changes Causing Missed Work due to a lack of informing of said changes,"As the title states, I'm in Ontario, Canada and recently, my employer made changes to the schedule without informing me of said changes causing me to miss a day's pay.  Errors with the scheduling happens quite frequently and has happened to me three times in the past year.   They informed me once of the change but let's just say relations hasn't been good and they have kept communications rather sparse.   Something to note is they require us to have 3 weeks in advanced for any time off requests but schedule changes seem to be done with less than a week's advanced notice.   I don't see how this is fair, but according to this link it seems Ontario doesn't require employers to even inform us of changes.Can Employers Change your Schedule Without Notice in Ontario? - Levitt Sheikh Employment & Labour Lawyers (levittllp.com)I'm not sure if it's the same as not required to let us know it has changed rather than asking for permission.   How else would an employee realize their schedule has been changed and take the necessary steps to make sure they can work or not or in the latter case, inform their employers they can't fulfill that obligation.   It really seems like they make changes at their whim and with impunity although I haven't heard of anyone being reprimanded when they don't show up for their shift that was a late change.So this isn't a question about seeking compensation but more about how to protect onself if they try to play games and accuse you of not coming to work."

You can say, ""yeah but in this way they avoid people reselling them with profit"", but it's not in favor of the community, they are the ones who keep all the power and increase the prices on their will.When buying a new car, the car factory has to have reasonable prices cause if not you can buy a second hand one, and in the same way it happens with pretty much all products, so, why not?At the same time, everyone can buy a plane ticket, it's not like they check your crime history or if you have a visa for the country you are travelling to.

"Hypothetically speaking, is there ANY circumstance where a city/state/municipality/etc. could inherit (or benefit from) a majority of someone’s will?","Region doesn’t matter, could be international but ideally let’s start in the US and work from there.This is a bizarre sounding question I admit, but for context I’m writing two stories revolving around ideas of justice. I often have legal questions pertaining to US law when I’m writing these genres, but in the past I’ve done alright just skirting around the problem so I don’t get into specifics. It might be a better idea to just start asking questions here though, if not for accuracy’s sake then for the sake of keeping my stories in the direction I intended them.So back to the question, I guess it’s as much of an economics question as a legal one. Similar to how many real-life murders are incentivized by lucrative life-insurance policies, is there any way a city/state/country/etc. could benefit from the death of a multi-millionaire or billionaire? What happens if their will is confusing or gibberish? Is that even possible? What if there was a will but a multi-death tragedy like a car crash meant everyone was dead?Okay lots of questions, just rambling to show the limits of my legal understanding. Don’t answer all of those, the one thing I was genuinely curious of was the main question and this: if there was a will but a death meant no one alive to receive, BUT a small portion to go charity, would that charity then receive a larger contribution? As in, there is no one left alive on the will EXCEPT the charity… could they get more? And if no, could a city/state/etc. stand to gain something?I’m not sure what happens if someone dies and there is no will, maybe that’s a better place for me to start researching and not waste people’s time on hypotheticals. But if you’re still reading I appreciate you and I’d like to hear your perspective."

Is there any recourse in cases of abusive reporting to social-services protective agencies?,"My brother works in social services, which for this discussion means that he knows some tricks.He has wanted Mom out of her house since Dad died, which (in my opinion) is context for all of his actions relevant here. ""John"" has no special position of authority or responsibility and contributes nothing to Mom's well-being. (The power of attorney was stripped from him several years ago because he was behaving erratically and irresponsibly.)Last summer, he filed a report with Department of Human Services against me, her de facto caregiver living on-property. The caseworker's visit found his claims to be without merit. But there were no consequences. There are no consequences for false reporting to DHS.Today Mom is in hospital - hip fracture and replacement. The injury happened mysteriously, in the kitchen on a flat, non-slip surface where I found her and cared for her in consultation with her doctor's team before calling EMT's on their advice.Now, ""somebody"" has filed a report against me with Adult Protective Services. The hospitalist refers to this as a matter that ""muddies"" the issue of her immediate future, but believes we'll get through this okay.My question is: what can I do about gratuitous reporting? Is there anything, or nothing I can even do? Is there any recourse? Conversely, what might I best not do. I'm restraining myself from any exuberant expressions of emotion, and certainly not making any accusations.I'm in the depth of my heart hoping to get Mom home and that's my only real priority now. But I also must worry that this pattern will continue, that there may be no end of devious, misguided reporting that could eventually take away everything that Mom has, and reduce her life to a congregate setting before it's necessary - during a pandemic. Any little bit of guidance would help."

B wants to hold an in-person holiday party 11 days after they tested positive (party is tentatively scheduled for 12/22). For what it's worth, B also thinks COVID is a ""plandemic"" and has not taken it seriously since the beginning of the pandemic. B has symptoms of COVID and is treating it with Ivermectin. They have not been vaccinated.FM has sent a few emails and a text about ideas for a virtual party to prevent COVID from spreading throughout the office, but B hasn't responded to any of them. B responds to other emails/texts, so they're just ignoring the virtual party ones. B has continued to push for an in-person party and has said that it is ""mandatory and an expectation"" for FM to physically attend all events to ensure they go smoothly. FM is now worried that they will be fired for not attending or planning an in-person event since it's mandatory.How legal is it to require that employees attend an event with someone who is symptomatic with COVID?

"Hypothetically could businesses get around laws that only apply past a certain number of employees or gain tax benefits that are supposed to only go to smaller businesses by legally restructuring into a bunch of separate businesses bound to provide certain ""services"" to each other by contract?","I would not do this, and please don't try this at home (or at your business). This is obviously unethical. But what if any measures are there to prevent this sort of a loophole?For instance suppose a restaurant wants more staff but they don't want to have to offer a health plan. The boss, instead of hiring more staff pitches an idea to his brother. His brother draws up the papers and starts his own 'business' which provides the service of providing restaurants with additional help from its own employees. His brother's business signs some kind of a contract with the restaurant effectively promising that his employees will spend most or all of their time providing that service to that restaurant. The employees legally have his brother as his boss, but the contract says his brother is to give orders to his employees to take orders from the restaurant owner, and that the contract is void with a large financial penalty if the brother violates that.Now each business has less than the statutory minimum of employees for requiring a health plan on paper but in practice the same work is done that would've been done had the restaurant just hired all of them directly.Obviously this could extend beyond just two 'small businesses' (on paper). You could hypothetically have 100s of 'small businesses' that have a web of contracts with each other to result in the same day to day actions as they would if it were just one business.Has this ever been tried and what is there in law (statutory, administrative, or case law) to close that loophole?"

Trust / Crummey Letter Question,"My grandparents set up two trusts for grandchildren (11 of us total). The first one was created in 1990, before my sister was born. The second one was created in 1993 or so, after my sister was born. In my understanding, there are 10 beneficiaries on the first trust and 11 on the second, but I could be wrong.My grandmother died in 2014. My grandfather died in 2020. After my grandmother died, my grandfather was still contributing to the trusts annually. From 2015 - 2020 I received a Crummey letter, and every year I waived my right to receive my share of what was gifted to the trusts.My grandparents’ estate was pretty large, and it is still being settled. One of my cousins asked my mother recently what all the Crummey letter stuff was about and if we would receive money from that. My mother told her that we (the grandchildren) would not be receiving money from the trusts, and that is something my grandparents did to avoid taxes. I don’t think my mother or any of her three siblings have any malicious intent (I know families can get ugly in these circumstances). But I also think my mother misspoke in saying that the grandchildren would not receive money from the trusts.My questions…The grandchildren should receive money from the trusts, correct?When will the grandchildren receive the money from the trusts? Is there typically a date of maturity for the trust? Or is it just likely when the estate is resolved, and the powers that be get to this piece of the larger estate puzzle?As a beneficiary of the trusts, do I have any legal rights to acquire information regarding the state of the trusts?Thanks for the help. Sorry if necessary details are not included; I tried to provide all the info I have."

Can I sue FL school board for their failed SLD program?,"Explanation:When in elementary school I was placed in an SLD class to ""help"" me. The class was filled with trouble-maker kids who took the teacher's attention away from the few kids who actually needed help. Countless times these other kids would throw things at me, insult me, etc., and any and every time I attempted to retaliate I was the only one who got in trouble for the situation.One SLD ""teacher"" withheld my lunch until I completed a math worksheet. This same ""teacher"" told my mother on one occasion that I was ""taking the place (in her class) of a student who could be there instead. Also, in that same class, I poked a pencil through my shirt. (I was a child and didn't care.) Because I said I didn't care when she confronted me about it, this ""teacher"" decided to call a young child ""white trash"".From there I was bounced to my third elementary school. In this class, the teacher had very little patience for me due to the divided attention with trouble-maker kids.I had a friend at the time who was being home-schooled. Being an overweight child with glasses in a classroom full of abusive, bullying, troublemaking kids, coupled with being punished for even attempting to defend myself, being home-schooled was looking awesome.We tried, but my mom was working during the day and I had a short attention span, so needless to say I fell through the cracks.I attempted to go to middle school but I was again forced into an SLD class that only had one other child besides myself that actually need help. The rest of the students were trouble-makers.After about a year I dropped out of middle school after getting sick and never went back.I attempted to go to GED classes, but I was in the same problem I was before. I needed help to understand the work I was doing, in a class with a teacher who didn't care."

Cleaning up the mess after familial abuse,"Hi everyone. I am cutting and pasting from a post I made in r/personalfinance to spell out the details of my situation. I am asking this sub now to help me decide, what, if any, legal action I need to take.I (41F) am writing because I am taking care of my aging mother (73F). This is a complicated and messy situation, but I will try to be as succinct as possible.To put a long story short, my brother is a drug addict, a sociopath (I'm not exaggerating), an abuser, and a thief. He has destroyed my mother's finances and we are now digging out of it.A couple of years before my dad passed away, a little over a year ago, my brother convinced my parents to let him move in. In almost no time, he was stealing from them left and right and ruining their shit. They did manage to kick him out eventually, but after my Dad died, my mother ""let"" him move back in. I put ""let"" in quotes because my mother was grieving and he is an evil, manipulative abuser and for all I know he showed up and said ""I'm not leaving.""After 9 months we finally had him removed with a court order after the abuse escalated to physical as well as the emotional and financial abuse. I took her out of state to live with me and we put her house on the market. Its under contract now and in less than two weeks time, she'll have about 100k to bank (319k minus reverse mortgage payoff minus 90k condo purchase).My mother's bank accounts have been closed for awhile (to keep his hands off her money) and she has been putting her SS and Reverse Mortgage checks into my bank account and paying her bills from there. Today she tried to deposit the reverse mortgage and my credit union said (for the first time in months) ""No, we don't do 3rd party checks"". So I tried to add her to my account as an authorized user and after trying to do so we learned she can't open an account or be added to an account because of monies owed to various banks. Basically, we realized my brother has been writing bad checks on her old accounts.I appreciate you if you have read this far.So the crux of my question is this: I want to contact a professional to help her dig out of this. I need some combination of an identity fraud expert/lawyer and a credit counselor. My mother has never dealt with finances in her entire life because my father always took care of things.I just want to get her stable and her credit in order. I don't want her to have to pay for legitimate fraud and identity theft and I also don't want creditors coming after her now that she is about to have a payout.A couple of notes:"

Visitation,"I'm in the state of New York and I have a few questions. Court order states that the father should not consume alcohol 12 hours prior to his parenting time nor while she is in his care. He has multiple times. My daughter came back from Thanksgiving and brought some things to my attention. Said she didn't want to go back. Apparently dad drinks multiple times a week. She and he are sleeping in the same bed as she doesn't have one of her own. (she's 10) The last straw for me was when she said ""Don't worry mom, when dad drinks too much I just go hide in the bathroom"". I have filed for a change in visitation and custody and a violation of the court order. My concern is that Christmas break is coming up. The court order says its his time. If I withhold her I'm breaking the court order. If I send her it's endangering her welfare. My current plan is to keep her here until the hearing which God only k ows when that will be. Is that wise? Someone told me today about an order of cause and how I can get a temporary hearing just to decide on this visit. CPS has gotten involved at this point  to talk to my daughter and the judge ordered a home study. But the order of cause, can that help me so I don't break the court order and so I can keep her safe in the mealtime? If not an order of cause what can I do to cover my ass so to speak?"

You cannot tell your attorney you murdered and then testify that you did not?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rayjdq/trump_ally_steve_bannon_can_be_prosecuted_in_a/hnm4qez/""An attorney may not lie to the court or knowingly allowing false evidence to be introduced to the court. E.g., if my client told me he took the candy bar, I can not allow him to testify and say ""I never took the candy bar!"" I also can not argue that he never took it.""I've heard there is a difference between American and British legal perspective on this, the above sounds like what I've heard about British Law, would be interesting to know the poster's nationality.  I'm assuming American law.I've read comments somewhat like this is the past, but not this blunt, so it made me question some of my assumptions and I'd like some clarification.  My questions are purely academic out of my own curiosity:From watching ""Don't Talk to the Police"" on Youtube I already know that your attorney should do all your speaking for you.  My understanding of this is, even if you are innocent and want to say ""I am innocent, I would never do such a terrible crime!"", you do not say it, you have your attorney say ""My client is innocent, and would never do such a terrible crime.""  And I would have assumed that even if you graphically confessed a murder or rape to your attorney, they are still supposed to say on your behalf, ""My client is innocent.""Am I completely wrong on this, as far as American law goes (also interested to hear the British view)?As an example, let's assume that John committed a serious crime like rape or murder but did so carefully enough that there is a decent chance he might avoid prosecution much less conviction if he keeps his mouth shut and his lawyer plays the cards right.  On one hand John wants his attorney to believe he is innocent so he will be more passionate in his defense.  On the other, John thinks the attorney should know exactly what happened in detail so that the attorney can come up with exculpatory possibilities to argue on John's behalf, or to know how close the prosecution is getting to the truth.Like, I'm trying to imagine John telling his attorney he is innocent as a newborn baby, but then telling his attorney ""well what if I was here doing this or there doing that"" and asking the attorney to raise those possibilities to the D.A. but in attorney speak like ""what if my client was here when that happened"", so as to make the D.A. think the case against him is too weak and drop the charges.So which is it, does John want to tell his attorney that he is completely innocent, or does John want to be honest in detail?  What options might become not available with each course of action?"
legality of disputing bank debit transaction?,"Hi! I recently used an app called nate that is essentially a browser extension that checks out for me online.

I saw them get our of their car to check the rear end and I pulled over at the next available right (they could see where I turned in to, it's just a local business) I got out of my vehicle to see if there was any damage to my vehicle (there wasn't) while I waited for them to come talk to me / exchange any necessary information. They didn't ever come and when I looped back around to where they had originally pulled over to try and talk to them, they were already gone. There is no damage to my vehicle and I didn't see any obvious damage to theirs either. Frankly, I'm not even really 100% sure I even hit them, as there was no sound of any kind or any obvious kind of jolt. But I don't want to get charged with a hit and run, or leaving the scene of an accident, or anything like that when I really did make a reasonable effort to talk to them / exchange any insurance information.

Breaking our lease…,"Looking for help to see if we have any ground to break our lease. We are in Jefferson county in Colorado. Below are a list of things that we believe might be grounds for us to break our lease but we need help.On 10/31/21 we excessive gas in our kitchen and our oven was inspected as hazardous with a delayed ignition, at this point I believe the house was legally considered unhabitantable. Out landlord asked us to contact kenmore for repairs, they arrived 11/02/21 and could not fix the oven due to no on/off valve for the gas line leading into the oven, the valve was installed 11/6/21. We finally got a new oven on 11/18/21 that does actually cook food despite it reading that it’s preheated (took 2.5hrs to roast veggies at 350). But either way we had  the hazardous appliance that sat in the home for almost three weeks.There weren’t any smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors installed until 11/10 and my lease started in June. We have one smoke detector in our main hallways and two carbon monoxide detectors installed one in the kitchen and one in the main hallway. None in the basement or private bedrooms, despite local law requiring it.The master bath has a sink in the bathroom which was spitting out dark brown water on 11/10 my roommate notified our landlord. He had a repair come out to see what was going on, the plumber let us know that all of our bathroom water lines were completely galvanized and the brown water was from the rust. He has not yet fixed that despite having the plumber personally text us that he would arrive but it has been three weeks and the sink remains running rusty water. All of us have been have hair falling out like crazy for months and I’m wondering if this is why. Overall we’re worried to even shower/drink the water from this house.Our lease has the right address but is written for the wrong county. Is there anything we can do it void the lease agreement?We’ve had a number of other issues like the heat not being on for two days and then not getting repaired after 24hrs, no hot water for three days while we waited for a new water heater to be put in, and a washer that is about 50 years old and doesn’t really clean clothes.We need help because we are tired of constantly calling plumbers on behalf of our landlord, living in a house that has broken or halfway working appliances, and would like to break our lease.Any thoughts if we still have authority to break the lease? What would you do?"

I worked on a project (wrote a 60 page book) that didn't go anywhere at an old job but I want to pursue and expand it myself. I left that job 6 years... are there any legal issues with me expanding on it ?,"It was a visual historical piece where I was verbally given a very loose concept that I wrote and rewrote and turned into a fully formed piece. I even acted as archival photo editor, choosing 80% of the images.  They (the job) printed a short run but that was that... it never went anywhere.I left the job in 2016 and now I want to expand on it further, make it a bigger thing. Again, the concept was very general and nothing a person could own, but the writing and the connections made were all mine. Are there any possible legal issues I should be aware of if I pursue this further?"
URGENT HELP,"Location: Colorado Springs, ColoradoI am not familiar with Colorado law so I would greatly appreciate some help.We broke our lease and moved out due to buying a house. Our landlord knew we would be doing this before our lease began. Anyways, I will get straight to the facts/questions.In our lease, there is absolutely nothing about penalties for breaking the lease. Our landlord is trying to say we forfeit our security deposit and owe him Decembers rent as a penalty.I have attached a screenshot of what it says about the security deposit. He is also having someone move in on December 1st. He would be ""double dipping"" on rent which I thought was illegal.My question is what legally can he charge us for breaking our lease? Is he allowed to keep our security deposit? Can he charge us for Decembers rent but rent it to someone else on the 1st of December?Thank you in advancehttps://preview.redd.it/tyfs14h4jm281.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ff8bc41fc381ecf025816aee640d8d18f380f3f"
My lawyer ghosted me and my trial is in two days. Help! VT,"Last September my wife kicked me out. She was the financial manager and breadwinner, so I had nothing but a few hundred dollars in my bank account and what chattel I could fit in the back of my truck in the course of a few hours. I was completely homeless for 4 months and committed myself to an intensive mental health program instead of taking my own life.  I came really close to committing suicide. Like really close.After spending months trying and failing to get legal help as a homeless and unemployed person the Vermont Bar Association found a low-bono attorney that was willing to take my case, and they provided a grant for the first 10 hours of his service.The lawyer and I had a few short conversations, and he did show up in court for a preliminary ""status hearing.""  Outside of that, he has been generally hands-off and unhelpful.  He always had an excuse for running behind the court's schedule and usually blamed ""technology"" on his inability to produce documents, etc.A month before the final court date I started trying to reach out to make sure that everything was in order.  No response.  Twelve emails and multiple calls later, still no response. Finally, I called the court to see if I could figure out what the hell was going on.  I didn't even know how and when to show up for court at that point!  My lawyer straight-up ghosted me.As it turns out, he also failed to submit the required financial affidavits (that I faithfully turned over to him in a timely manner), causing my wife's counsel to file multiple ""Motions to Compel Discovery,"" and eventually a ""Motion for Contempt and Enforcement and Motion in Limine.""  Because I am afraid of my abusive and spiteful wife, I made sure that she could not find my current residence or place of employment by insisting that all documents be sent to my lawyer, so I was never personally given notice of these actions.I figured out how to file a motion to continue on my own, and just left the status conference where I found out I will likely get granted a continuance come our actual court date on 12/1. It is unlikely that I will have no more than a month to retain counsel and start over with a new attorney.  It is for certain that I do not have the financial abilities to retain counsel.  What the hell do I do?"
"Photography, consent, and hospitals","Good evening legal eagles, I have question regarding a debate about a nurse giving consent for a patient to photograph their badge and having second thoughts about it later. Can an individual revoke consent for a photograph that they had initially consented to in the first place.Are there laws in the US which support the ability of someone to revoke consent after the picture was already taken?(I am very obviously not a lawyer, but I feel like revoking consent in such a manner doesn't carry legal weight and is unethical)"
"NJ, does a school need to inform students if covid cases?","I attend a secondary school, specifically a beauty school. My husband is very immunocompromised so I take covid very seriously and try very hard to make sure I do not bring it home. Last week a student in my class tested positive for Covid. They did not inform any of us that we were in close proximaty to someone that tested positive. I am very upset and hurt. I only figured it out when I put the pieces together. Now it's all finally out to us after confrontation (not from the school her friends admitted it).Her friends in the class all got tested but we were not informed. Now some of us have to miss Thanksgiving with our elderly families. When the school was confronted they say that since they're a secondary school they do not need to tell us. I am not informed on the lega of that, so I was hoping someone could shed light. In no way, shape or form do I want to know the names of students that test positive. That should remain anonymous, however I would like to know if I was around someone that tested positive. I don't think that is too much to ask."

How do some criminal cases have defendants that plead guilty without a plea deal (how exactly to pleas work)?,"I just read an article on the Christopher Belter case, where he was sentenced - as an adult - to no jail time for 3 counts of sexual assault and 1 count of third-degree rape.  I am confused that this individual plead guilty, and then the judge decided his punishment.  I was under the belief that pleading guilty was a mutual agreement between the prosecution and the defense, where the prosecution may offer a lighter sentence for pleading guilty to some of the crimes being charged.  How does the defendant enter into a plea deal with a judge?  If the defendant does plead guilty to a judge, how would a judge decide to go so far outside of sentencing guidelines?"

"If Gage Grosskreutz had shot Kyle Rittenhouse instead of trying to disarm him, would he have been within his legal right?","I watched a lot of the Rittenhouse trial, and I don't want this to become a post about whether or not people agree with that verdict, but I still don't understand who was legally, ""correct,"" between Kyle and Gage.  If you don't know, Gage was the 3rd person that Kyle shot, and never made physical contact with Kyle.  Kyle shot Gage and was found not guilty of attempted homicide, with the defense claiming that the fact that Gage had a deadly weapon entitled Kyle to defend himself.  However, it would seem at this point that had Gage shot Kyle, he would have been very well within his right to defend not only himself, but others around him (given that his statement under oath is that he was responding to what he thought was an active shooter, then witnessed that person shoot somebody right in front of him).  So who has the right to defend themselves in this situation?  Is there an overlapping area where one person can use deadly force to defend themselves (and/or other people) against a person that is using deadly force to defend themselves?"

This is to do with copyright law maybe even patent law.,"So I saw lately a lot of disappointment in video games this year not living up to expectations due to game play, graphic, glitches and what ever else.I don't doubt that most or ""all"" have the actual intention of improving their game fixing the issues but there seems to be a ""understanding"" that most will try but some will put out a disappointing game and move on.Here is my question;If I take a video game and ""improve it"" over the original, how much of an improvement would there need to be to be able to call the new version mine and hold all rights to it?I base this thought on the facts that IF I take a patent and improve on it enough, it doesn't even need to be a full redesign just gain of function and not even significant, you get to file a new patent, you don't own the original but you do have the right to the new one.This applies to art as well especially in the modern digital age, the famous example being Obamas picture in the HOPE poster, it was based on a real picture someone took and someone else transformed it enough to be able to claim it as their own work.Would I be able to make this type of argument in court and win slim margin even?"
How to execute a will in Florida,My dad died this week. He had a will prepared a couple years ago which was done at a free law library not by a law firm. So basically a LegalZoom will.

It’s pretty straightforward: a set amount of money to each child and all other assets to his wife. Everything they owned was in both their names.   Thanks for any advice
"Would (and how) the Four Horsemen from ""Now You See Me"" be prosecuted?","Take the opening scene: robbing the French Bank. The FBI arrests them, and they confess to doing it, but with magic. And they turn away from charging them with the robbery because they cannot explain or prove how it happened.Can they actually be prosecuted? I can see how they could prove that the crime did happen, and that they were involved (the bank notes destined for that specific bank made their way to Vegas). But if they cannot prove how... does it really matter, or would that be a part of demonstrating to a jury ""beyond reasonable doubt"" ""this is what they did, this is how they did it, this is the evidence to prove that."""
Missing bonus pay,"I work for a large hospital which belongs to an even larger corporation.  We were promised bonus pay for certain months when the pandemic was straining our resources.   We were so short-staffed that management promised bonus pay for picking up extra shifts (in writing in the form of emails).  I work in the ICU and am a staff nurse, so I make a fraction of what travel nurses make so this bonus was nice for working without lunch breaks and being so short-staffed that you felt like you were suffocating throughout your 12 hr shifts.  Payroll never paid out my last 2 bonuses and it's been 1.5m months of going back and forth with them to get them to pay what is owed to me.  I'm not the only one they did this to and we are all struggling to get backpack with some colleagues being owed money from April.  Other than applying pressure to HR and payroll as we have been doing, what else can we do?  I work in Texas, so we do not have a union."

"Ohio, United States - recourse for landlord entering without advanced notice?","I live in an apartment complex in Ohio. Our lease got bought out by a new management company and I can no longer access my electronic lease agreement because it didn't transfer to the new system and I regret not printing my own hard copy. They claim that they only need to knock and announce that they are entering and that they can technically enter at any time, but that doesn't sound right to me. I'm already moving out in May when I graduate but I keep having issues. My landlord has been having contractors do renovations around the complex. They've entered my apartment multiple times without proper advance notice and done damage to my stuff, plus I have a cat and they've put her at risk.The first instance was in September when they were renovating the plumbing. They gave me a notice about updating the electrical work with instructions to move all of my furniture away from the walls and unplug all appliances each day in the one-week window when they would be doing this work. They never did the electrical work, but the day after the one-week window they came in and replaced the sinks and toilet. To do so, they dumped all my stuff out from under the sink and left it in a pile on my kitchen floor, and again in the bathroom. They also left construction materials (washers and screws) on the floor and they weren't exactly careful about how they did this, so there was an overturned bottle of bleach that spilled on my kitchen floor. I contacted them about it because I was concerned about my cat potentially drinking bleach or eating/chewing a screw and getting a foreign body, they assured me it would never happen again.The next time it happened, they were redoing the patio and porch lights. They gave a week's time frame to do it and then showed up after the allotted time frame. They dealt significant damage to my home garden. They also left chunks of metal from the railing project as well as paint can lids and paint brushes in my plants. At this point they gave me a 100$ rent reduction for the month to offset the cost of the damage.Today they entered without providing any advance notice to do the wiring project that they mentioned in September. They didn't do as much damage this time, but they still left construction materials all over the floor and my grow light for my houseplants no longer works.Is there any legal recourse to keep them from continuing to do this? I'm not as concerned about the damage to my stuff as I am about the potential harm to my cat, since they leave doors open when they're working and they leave screws and such on the floor. I really would just like advanced notice so I know to lock my cat up for the day, but I can't find any good sources for how far in advance a landlord needs to notify you to enter an apartment in Ohio. Would it be worth contacting a lawyer or is this something I'll just need to deal with until may? I'm a graduate student so money for a lawyer is tight.I do have photo evidence of all three instances and I've retained all the emails and the letters that they taped to my door."

"(Los Angeles, CA) how could I get out of my lease without breaking it over not having clean water/negligent landlord? 2 of the 3 months I've been here I haven't had clean water but can't afford to break lease or be evicted","Hi, currently in an apartment that I thought was a score but unfortunately is an older building with not-maintained pipes. Over a month ago a notice went out to all tenants that the pipes/tanks were being flushed and since then my shower water has been unusable even with trying various filters. The water's so hard and smells really metallic and stains the tub red where the water lands. I have pictures. Thankfully the smell and redness is gone for now with the latest filter, but the water is still so hard (maybe not even the right word, I'm from southern california and a swimmer, I'm used to hard water...but never had hard water *burn* my skin and make it flake and peel, or make my hair fall out and break pretty much immediately or be dry like straw on contact...making it impossible to wash hair).Without a filter the water reads at 350ppm in a glass cup and while the water is finally no longer red on contact, it's so cloudy you can't really see through until the particle settle. After a filter (and I've tried many) it's still about 350ppm.I've been showering at my friend's place across town in the meantime but this isn't sustainable and frankly I'm about ready to move into her building where this isn't an issue and the landlord isn't so negligent and an asshole - how am I paying the same rent to not be able to use a shower or have clean water?I did put in multiple maintenance requests and plumbing requests in writing and my landlord sent the on site maintenance guy...who's an incompetent idiot in every way, and then also sent a plumber. The plumber said he'd have to investigate the pipes/tanks/system and I'd hear from him. I got an email from my landlord that said he didn't find anything wrong and basically eat shit because ""no one else is having these problems."" I sent her pictures of the red staining and a video of how it's definitely the water after it hits a surface, it's a clean tub too. I also know my next door neighbor is also having plumbing issues because their roof started leaking smelly yellow water and the LL took forever to have a shoddy patch job done. Their lease ended recently and I think they moved.Now my question: is it possible to get out of my lease for not having access to clean water...or even just clean enough to shower in and not smell worse after the shower than before (the metallic smell is INTENSE)? I'm only 3 months into my lease and 2 of those 3 months I haven't had clean running water, but there's so much time left that I wouldn't be able to afford to break the lease and pay the remainder easily (after living here it's pretty clear that the units aren't in high demand yet the ll keeps raising the rents...so many remain empty and with how negligent my landlord is I feel like I can safely assume that my unit likely won't get quickly rented out)."
Former boss's police officer son just delivered me a letter at 10:30 PM,"Thank you so much to any who can help me on this!A little background, I used to work in a restaurant and about four months ago, I got a larger check than I expected during a period that I was working a lot of overtime. I went ahead and deposited it, and I figured if anything was wrong with it my employer would let me know pretty quickly. My boss is the owner of the restaurant and is frequently away, so we don't often communicate unless it's necessary. He had clearly signed the check, and months went by without him saying anything, so I assumed everything was okay.I ended up getting a better job about a month ago, and I no longer work there, but I live pretty much next door to the restaurant and he has my number. Tonight, my girlfriend and I are laying on the couch, it's 10:30 PM, and we are awoken to some loud knocking at the door. We peak outside and a cop car is sitting on the curb. I open the door, kind of alarmed, and it's my boss's son, a police officer, here to hand me a letter regarding overpayment of this check. I have no problem paying it back, but can this man really send the police to my house on the first attempt to recollect his money??Also, this is the worst timing for this to happen of course, so how soon do I need to pay him back?"

Voluntary resignation.. is this legal?,"So, the vaccine mandates have begun and my employer, my local hospital, is being forced to implement it. Failure to comply will result in what they are referring to as “voluntary resignation.”However, that’s just not the truth. Those who refuse vaccination are not wishing to resign at all. They simply want to be able to make the choice for themselves. They are actually being forced to resign for not complying with their mandate but otherwise have no desire to leave their jobs. They are being forced to take the vaccine, or they will lose their jobs.So my question is, is “voluntary resignation” under these circumstances actually legal?"

Medical Assault and Battery - Do I even have a case to make?,"Last year was hard on everyone, myself included. I have depression and anxiety and had a crisis that resulted in me going to an inpatient facility. My time at the ER prior to my transfer though was very traumatic.From the moment I came in and was initially evaluated by a nurse, a security guard escorted me to get labs and go to the psych floor. She taunted me and made fun of me because I was shaking with fear and afraid of the needle for blood test.When I got to the psych floor, I was not told what was happening or what to expect, just given a chair. When I asked when I’d be going home, the floor nurse said “not any time soon” and left it at that. I panicked, said they couldn’t hold me against my will (although technically I was a 1013), but continued to cry and shake in my chair. Security, including the guard from previously, came in and threatened to sedate me if I didn’t calm down. Shockingly I didn’t calm down at this, and they grabbed me aggressively (I have photos of the leg bruise a week later), took me to a solitary room, pinned me to the bed, and the previous guard was the one to administer the sedative.I was not a danger to anyone, I was not threatening or violent. They should not have threatened the use of medical restraint nor used it. And unless that guard was trained in medication administration, she should not have been the one to sedate me. I got my records back and they claim I was agitated and threatening.I just don’t know what to do or where to start. I and every mentally ill person who has been medically assaulted to control them deserves justice, but I don’t know the steps to take. I’ve reached out to local lawyers but because I didn’t die or lose a limb, they aren’t interested in helping me. What can I do?"
Colorado Tenant Laws- Breaking lease,"Hi all,I will try to keep this simple and state the facts. We (my boyfriend and I) moved from Texas to Colorado Springs in May, I'm not familiar with Colorado rental laws and I'm having trouble finding someone who can help us answer our questions.Facts:We are purchasing a home and closing on the 18th of this month. Our neighborhood is getting a lot more crime. Our cars have been egged, windows have been smashed on a bunch of cars on our street, gun shots on the street behind us outside our house.We are breaking our lease which I understand has penalties. Our landlord is saying we forfeit our security deposit ($2100) and will owe him for Decembers rent. (I've attached a snipped from our lease about what it says for the security deposit) He is saying we have to be out by end of NovemberHe is having someone move in on December 1st, but is having is pay Decembers rent as a ""penalty"" for breaking the lease. There is absolutely nothing about penalties for breaking it written in our lease.From what I have gathered, he can keep our security deposit (or part of it) to pay for rent until a new tenant moves in (or just charge us that rent amount). I can't find anything that says he can legally keep it just for breaking the lease.Then also, he is trying to charge us Decembers rent (while making us leave by the end of November) and having someone start their lease December 1st. I thought that was illegal.My question(s) I guess are what is he allowed to charge us if nothing is written in our lease and can he double-dip on rent like that?I have already tried to talk to him about not paying Decembers rent and he immediately threatened to not find a new tenant for a few months so we would have to pay even more rent. He isn't budging on keeping our security deposit/ charging us another months rent. I would just pay it then sue him if my findings are correct and he cant keep/charge us either of those.Thank you in advance"

In US law if someone publishes a mathematical proof and the terms and conditions make the publication the intellectual property of the journal that publishes it how far reaching is the journal's control beyond just the publication?,"A lot of journals assume the copyright if a mathematician publishes to them and from my understanding if you want to either retain the copyright or make it creative commons that usually costs a hefty fee. I was wondering how far reaching the publisher's copyright may extend in US law.For instance say you could design a chemical solution, a machine, an algorithm, or some other invention that relied on the proof? Would that also become the intellectual property of the journal? Or could you patent/copyright these things yourself?Would you need permission from the journal to teach the mathematical concepts even if you are the author? In person casually? In a classroom setting? On youtube?Or are the IP rights of the journal strictly limited to the formal publication?Also any relevant legal precedents, statutes, or court cases would be helpful if you were to cite them.Thank you."
What is the difference between a stay and an injunction?,"So, this week, the Biden administration put out their OSHA vaccine mandate, and was immediately sued by at least 11 states and dozens of private companies.

Emotional distress or hostile living environment case???? Thoughts?,"Since the day I moved in, my 2000 a month that I am NEVER late with has gotten me the following:
•I’ve been lied to about parking for a year, accused of MULTIPLE FELONIES. • Had the police called on me bc a resident didn’t believe i belonged in the building (once) •Been called a NI&;R  (3x) •followed by a resident who thought I was sabotaging the elevator then pushed and told I’m black and therefore an idiot.(2x, the second time on video.) •I tried to not see this through a racial lens,  but I am one of less than 5 black people given the “privilege of even TOUCHING lease papers, let alone signing. AGAIN, I PAY 2000 A MONTH AND HAVE NEVER BEEN LATE.  In return,  instead of the same respect, security and care for wellness afforded to others, this is what I have paid for: • Despite knowledge of racial discrimination and cops called against me,  have never received a single call,letter,email or visit to check on my welfare. • When the too girls across from me felt threatened when I knocked on the door,  the manager IMMEDIATELY ran up to help THEM. Incidentally this was the first in person communication with the building manager and myself.Though I knew I had a right to be upset I was very careful with my communication but nevertheless I was immediately commanded to go back to my apartment because he perceived my anger as aggressionAnd threatened to call the police, The second attempt to communicate like adults with my neighbor ended with them calling security who threatened to call the police and report a hostile black man running around the hallway. Understanding it to be the death threat that it was I went inside and thank God I recorded The whole thing. •I was then threatened with eviction and put on probation if anyone else in the building feels uncomfortable around me or if I “ Attempt to enter another apartment again”.This was a blatant lie and I’ve felt targeted for vacation since then. •When I was stalked through the hallways pushed and called a dumb black man I gave a statement and a video to management. Despite reporting a hostile living environment I’m ignored for three weeks until I finally called just to be told he doesn’t know who to believe. The only thing he has said to “help “ me is that if I feel so uncomfortable all the time then I’m allowed to move early.I know I’m probably vague and will gladly clear up any confusion and can go into greater detail but from the evidence that I’ve read and looked up in Oregon at the very least he has ignored a reported hostile living environment not to mention. emotional distress and defamation.

Registering as a company in order to buy and own copyrighted assets.,"Hello, I’ll try keep it as brief and simple as possible.What route should I take if i want to register as a company in order to secure the company name and pay creators to make assets for a game project that I am working on alone?I have a number of freelance artist, animators, designers, etc that want to create assets for me. I will be paying for them for it and they have agreed that these will be owned by my studio. It will not be a salary, just a fixed amount for these assets.Should i be registering as an LLC, company, business, studio? Will I be looking at annual fees of some sort?

Are limited credit cards used to avoid free trial gotchas fraud?,"Recently, I’ve seen lots of adverts for “privacy (dot) com” , which offers a service that lets you create multiple credit card numbers for different purposes. You can also set a spending limit on these individual “cards”, beyond which withdrawing from it will be declined. In many promotional sponsored segments in popular influencer’s content, this feature is often the focus, and it is shown being used to avoid automatic charges that are incurred in some subscriptions (if they’re not cancelled in time). In particular, free trials, which often automatically renew themselves as a paid plan subscription after the trial period ends, are shown being given numbers for which the spending limit has been set to zero dollars, meaning why attempt to charge them will fail. Does this constitute fraud? After all, you are entering a payment channel address that you know will not work where it’d be expected to work. You are withholding payment, pavement you, in some sense, promised."

Verity Legal Group? Debt collection scam or legit? [crosspost for further reach],"Hello,I received a letter from Verity Legal Group stating that I owe ~$1000 to one of those payday loan type of companies.

Delayed Raises/Bonuses.,"I live and work in Kentucky, USA. I work for a large boc shipping company, I can elaborate more if necessary. There is a union, and I am a supervisor, which means I am not in the union.The union members have gotten about a four dollar raise. We were told we would also be getting raises, but there are issues with the union raises, delays and giving the wrong amount of money. We were told this has to be fixed before our raises were to take place, as in bottom to the too. We were told this in person by our supervisor, about 3 weeks ago, and the raises for union members have been in the works for around a month before that.I have not been able to find out when our raises are supposed to take place. I have also not been able to find out if there will be retroactive, like the union raises. To the best of my knowledge, union members  got raises, but were told they would see the change in one lump sum, then at the higher pay from then on. Talking to other supervisors, supervisor raises have not been retroactive in the past.Also, we are overdue for I believe  two bonuses. It's based on our facility's quarterly performance. I have worked as as supe for 8 months, and have gotten two bonuses, so I believe I am overdue one.Is there anything here that is at least interesting enough to try to get more information to pursue legally? I feel like we are getting the run around in regards to our pay."

Not at Fault Car Accident,So I posted this in another subreddit but I need as much advice as I can get. My mom got into an accident today. Her back back is sore but all in all she's fine thankfully. Shes being accused  of being  the one at fault when it isn't. She had the green light and the car that hit her had a flashing yellow light. He hit the passenger side of her car. The passenger of the car that hit her had gotten out of the car and when the police got there the passenger acted like she was a bystander saying my mom had the red light. There's no cameras in the area and my mom was by herself in the car. She has almost a 20 year clean driving record. We're at a loss of what to do.
Death of an absent father,"FYI..all parties involved live in Oklahoma.My husband's father passed yesterday. We will call him Bob.  They did not have a relationship. They talked maybe once every 5-10 years and usually only because Bob needed money.Bob left no will. Had no insurance. We have no idea if he wanted a funeral, cremation, parade...nothing. The only surviving family are 2 elderly sisters, my husband and another daughter.  Right away the elderly sisters want my husband to plan a funeral which we said no to. We didn't know the guy. So now they are pissed that they have to do it and they want access to Bobs bank account to pay for it.Looks like to do this we'd need to get the death certificate and file probate. My husband is so sick with nerves from this and doesn't want to have anything to do with it.Can they (elderly sisters) take legal action and make my husband do anything? I know this might seem dumb but literally we have had no relationship with Bob. The only thing in common is blood. There were times we actually thought he was already dead.  The idea of going thru the legal system and spending money on someone who was such a POS is the least appealing thing we can think of.So...do we need to be worried or can we ignore the evil sisters and go on with our lives?"

Property Line Issues,"I bought a house in December of 2020. The sellers were flippers, but had a survey done so they could put up a new fence (I'm 706, neighbor I'm referencing is 708).In January, the property behind my house and my next door neighbors house, was sold to a developer to put up condos (705, 707, 709).He's claiming that his property is 6 ft into my back yard (red line in image).  Please note that until this developer came a long and took down a fence, it had been up for about 20 years or so (fence was on the property lines, but belonged to 705-709). My back fence was built basically up against that fence (leaving about a 6 inch gap between the two.The county records show the property as what was indicated on my recent survey (image is of county records).What are my protections?  They found the iron pipe where that red line is, but the property lines were established for at least 20 years.My next door neighbor has a litigation lawyer he's engaging with, which he said is good for me since if he deals with it, it would establish both of our property lines.I'm just a little freaked out as I don't have a ton of money to be spending on litigating a developer who wants to put condos behind me and take possession of my land.https://preview.redd.it/3hjq1wzeusv71.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ba69380ce12e7f4c5300166343c2743c1eb9b84"
Virginia Early Lease Termination,"Thank you in advance for any advice.My brother and I moved into what we thought was an alright neighborhood. The place was seemingly so good that we signed a two year lease. It turns out that this wasn't the case. On move-in week, we found that the back-facing bedroom window was shot out. We talked to the realtor at this point, but the clause (which I will specifically define) stated that we would be responsible for paying rent/utilities until they found another tenant. Backing out wouldn't be financially viable at that point.We soon realized that a few houses in the neighborhood (townhouses) were 'party houses'. With our house being a corner-house, this turned into music being blasted almost every afternoon and evening from spring break until now. With the walls shaking constantly working at home and trying to go to bed (we've made multiple noise complaints to no avail), we only had the winter to look forward to - figuring that it'd be too cold for people to hang around outside. This wasn't the case.Recently, despite the change in weather, things have gotten worse. Below is a recording taken from a mid-gain base-spec Blue Yeti microphone sitting on my desk from tonight:https://voca.ro/1nLANfGIhVyFThere's been a large group of +/- 10 people gathering directly outside of out house for the past week and a half or so. It's just at the point now where my brother and I are ready to go. Before getting in touch with our realtor, I've seen good results on this subreddit before and wanted to see if anyone's had an experience similar."

Can a communist psudo-state exist within us law as a legal tax exempt entity?,"Stupid question, but I randomly thought about this and am wondering what would prevent it.I start a religious organization, doesn't matter what, let's say a sect of Christianity.  My religious beliefs is that communist ideals are ordained by God.  Members would grant 100% of their income to the organization.  The organization in turn uses the funds to buy large swaths of land and build housing.  They then provide members access to food, housing, and all other needs with this money.  Also provide funding to business in the area, who in turn give their profits to the organization.  Other needs too, including private schools and private security.I'd think the result would be a private communist organization which all members are free from taxation from the parent government.   Of course they'd still retain citizenship of the us, and be subject to its laws."
(serious) Is it illegal to depict someone under the age of 18 in lewd or erotic scenes if they're considered a adult in the setting?,"As the title says, is it illegal to depict, say, a 16 or 17 year old in erotic (written, pure text) context if in the setting, people become adults at 16/17?

My employer denied me a pay raise.,"To start off, I appreciate any replies back on this post and what to do about being denied a pay raise and sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile.A little back story about my current job, I work with people with disabilities and I’ve been with my current company for about 4 years. My company has a employee evaluation that happens every 6 months and these determine if you get a raise and you’re able to get up to 50 cents depending on your eval. I was at the old pay cap and when it came time for raises this last go around about 6 months ago, I was denied my entire pay raise even though I had a phenomenal eval from my manager. I had 2 staff/coworkers who had been with the company barely 6 months and did less than I did and they got the full raise. I went and talked to my local HR rep about the pay raise and I was told “It wouldn’t be fair for other employees if you got moved from one pay cap to another pay cap and that it would provide me with zero incentive to continue working.” This HR rep knew that I had been with the company for the almost 4 years at the time and had been performing the job tasks of an assistant manager and at one point manager due to losing a manager because of a incident that happened with him and a patient. I didn’t apply for manager at this time because a patient of mine was extremely difficult to work with and caused extreme amounts of anxiety and stress when on shift and he had managed to scare off numerous veteran staff and managers. I helped transition over my patients I had been helping manage to my new manager and then quickly became his right hand man because of my good rapport with the patients and me knowing how everything had ran at the house and was self sufficient. Fast forward a few months and it came pay raise time and I got the shaft on it considering all the work and effort I’ve put in.I don’t know if what they did was illegal to deny my pay raise given what I was told or what? The only reason I haven’t tried to jump heads and talk to someone hire up in corporate is I’m afraid of retaliation happening. I have talked to my managers boss that is very honest and upfront about things and doesn’t hold anything against the staff. He’s had a few reports of a few staff that had the same thing happen even though they had been performing more than expected job duties and he has tried to even make something work with upper management. Would it be best to jump heads to corporate HR or wait until I leave this company in the next year and then alert corporate of what has been going on or even talk to a lawyer about it.TLDR: Worked my ass off and dealt with some really hard individuals and had done more job duties than what my job description says and when it came time for pay raises I got fucked and then told to go basically go fuck my self by my local HR rep when asked about the pay raise.

"Used refrigerator issues, warranty not upheld (Ohio)","On October 1st I purchased a used refrigerator from a used appliance and appliance repair shop for 430$. It came with a 30 day warranty and is printed on the receipt ""we are not held liable for damages or loss"". It worked fine for 5 days, then on day 6 I noticed everything in the freezer was thawing out (approximately 100$ in frozen meat). By the time I noticed the meat was thawing it was after buisness hours for the store, so I called them the next day as soon as they opened (Saturday).I was informed a technician would be sent out Tuesday. I ended up donating the food to a local foodbank to avoid it going to waste. Tuesday comes around and I never got a call and the tech never showed. I called at 5:30 to ask where he was since the store closed at 6 and they told me they had no idea and no way to contact him. He never ended up showing up.The next day I called again and spoke with the owner. He informed me the tech never showed up to work, and that he personally would be out the next day to look at it. He came and looked and said it had to thaw out (ice buildup in the back) and he would be back the next day between 3-4. He never showed, so I called at 5:30. He informed me he had ordered parts to fix it, but they wouldn't be in till the next week. He was to come out yesterday (Tuesday) to install the new parts, yet again no call and no show. I tried calling and was told he would come today at noon, something came up. He still hasn't shown up. I tried calling and am receiving no answer.Edit; forgot to add the freezer went out first, the next day the fridge side went as wellI doordash for a living and have wasted many days of potential income waiting around the house for someone to show up that never does. I paid 430 bucks for the fridge. I have lost over 100$ worth of food, not to mention the cost of having to buy fast food or take trips to the grocery store for every meal. Does it seem like I have a case for small claims? Realistically would it be worth it? Can I recoup any of the food costs or does that ""not responsible for damage and loss"" actually hold up? Should I wait till the 30 day warranty is fully up to file? Thank you in advance"

My equipment is being held by someone and won't give it back. what do I do?,"TL/DR: a load of my equipment got locked in a property after a company went under. I tried to get my stuff back but the person who has it all is ignoring my messages and calls.I worked at a studio that started up a few years ago but unfortunately it wasn't successful. Over the time I was there working as a freelance engineer I lent my equipment to aid use of the rehearsal room as well as stored a few inexpensive but highly favoured microphones there for recording.Unknown to me, the guys running the studio had fallen behind on the rent and the first I knew of it was when a band turned up to rehearse and th owner of the building that was sublet to us changed the locks.There were a whole bunch of arguments had between the studio owners and the property owner but once they had reached an accord and the dust settled I visited the property owner to ask for my stuff back.He told me that my stuff along with the other studio equipment that he owned is in storage  in a neighbouring town and it would be a week before he had time to go there. I was happy to meet him there and recover my equipment. This is where all contact ended.I have since messaged and had no response as well as he has ignored my calls when attempting to make contact.I don't know if it would be smart to threaten legal action or even if I can. It's not a great deal of stuff value wise, maybe £700 in value at the absolute most, so actually taking legal action may not even be worth it.What can/should I do?P.s. the guy in mind is quite a hot headed and over all intimidating person, so going in all guns blazing is not an option for a small guy like me."
"Purchased a domain name, having to do with my last name...also happens to be associated with a large food manufacturer. Received a cease and desist to give them the domain name, help? (I mean I kind of know what to do but I am not 100% and want to get a second opinion)","Long story short, my father asked me to get him a domain name so he can use it for email. Well we did this, came up with a catchy domain name that he can use. Well 1 week into having it up and live I just got this email from them. I have replaced all domain names with ""Company A"" so if it originally said gmail.com it now and the company name was ""G"" it would say ""Company Amail.com"" just to clear that up. I have also removed the trademark numbers. Email is below.The backstory why we chose Company A as the name, it's our last name. It's not a popular last name, at least from what I can tell. However they have nothing to do with email, webhosting, communications or anything. They are a food manufacturer. Any suggestions?Dear Sir/Madam, Re: Unauthorized Use and Registration of <Company Amail.com> (the ""Domain Name"") NOTE: If you are not the registrant of the Domain Name and are simply offering a private Whois function  to the registrant please forward this letter to the owner of the domain.RE: Company Amail.com Company A Company (“Company A”) has retained CSC Corporate Domains to serve as its corporate domain name  management representative. As you likely know, Company A is a global food products manufacturer with an  active worldwide digital media presence. Company A maintains distinct online presences for its most prominent  brands, including its Company A® brand. We are aware that you have registered the domain name  <Company Amail.com> and we’re contacting you to secure the transfer of that domain to Company A, the rightful  owner.In addition to the extensive goodwill the Company A brand has acquired, Company A owns multiple relevant  trademark registrations for the Company A trademark, including:(a) U.S. Trademark Reg. No. XXXXXXX for the word mark, Company A’S, (b) U.S. Trademark Reg. No. XXXXXXXX for the word mark, Company A’S, (c) Canadian Trademark Reg. No. XXXXXXXX for the word mark, Company A’S,(d) Australian Trademark Reg. No. XXXXX for the word mark, Company A’S and, (e) European Union Trademark Reg. No. XXXXXXXXX for the word mark Company A’S. In light of Company A’s established ownership of and equity in the Company A brand, your ownership and use of  the Domain Name is likely to cause confusion among consumers, create the false impression of an affiliation  between you and Company A or otherwise dilute the strength and value of Company A’s famous Company A brand.  We believe the current circumstances lead to the conclusion that the Domain Name has been registered in bad  faith pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (""UDRP""), adopted by  the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (""ICANN"") which provides, in part, that bad faith  registration arises when: ""by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to  your web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to  the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on  your web site or location.” See, UDRP, Para. 4(b)(iv) Company A prefers to handle this matter quickly and amicably without the need for adversarial proceedings.  Accordingly, we ask that you immediately transfer the Domain Name and any other domain names you own or"
I was kicked out of a band after two years of gigs in which each band member chose to give their gig earnings to make a record that I am no longer a part of. Now they want to deny me any compensation for all the time worked.,"After my day in the studio the band decided to let me go. From the start of our journey we had a meeting to decide that all of our earnings from gigs would go to making a record. We finally made our goal and went into the studio where out of nowhere, they felt I wasnt the right fit and simply cited creative differences.Of course, not thinking about a possible fallout, on top of being happy of being part of the group and music itself, I never thought this would need a written  agreement, so no written contract exists.However, the time spent and agreement of each band member lending their efforts to earn money for the band in order to fund their part in the recordings, I can only think compensating me for my portion of earnings is simply the ethical, and hopefully legal thing to do, now that I’m removed against my will from the band. We’ve also run on the concept of buying out band members for things such as equipment purchased should they leave the band.I may be ignorant in definitive definitions of the law, but I can’t help but feel using the money I was essential in helping the band earn for the record as a partnership, in which my work for the band was contingent on my participation on the record, is edging on the grounds of embezzlement. Also the fact that the band leader mentioned this was bad timing and this has been a thought of theirs to get rid of me for some time, makes me feel like it’s fraud for misleading me and waiting until a deposit was able to be made to fire me and use my 1/6th share to pay for a producer they could’ve never afforded without me.Do I have any legal recourse to demand those earnings back or is this an unethical but unenforceable thing?Thanks for any perspective everybody."
"Won't release medical records, board complaint not going anywhere, what now?","The General Practioner's office that I was going to up until recently 100% stopped fufilling any and all requests for records (specialists and my case worker), referrals, prior authorizations, refills, forms, etc.This was with recent visits and discussing these things with the doctor there.The office manager has hung up on me, complained to me about people trying to obtain my records, put down the phone and just walked away, told a specialist they won't do a form bc I haven't been seen in a year (I was seen a few months prior in person for vaccines, and even more recently in telehealth), and other bizarre behavior.There's no way to get past her, bc she's usually the one who picks up the phone and mans the front desk. I don't think it's possible that the doctors can be unaware.I've also been charged a missed appointment fee when I was scheduled for an appointment and the time came and went, with no link to do the appointment.I was finally able to get someone on the phone a few hours later, and the office manager was yelling hysterically at me that the appointment was in person.A. No one bothered to tell me that. B. This is when they were only doing emergency appointments in person, and everything else was telehealth. This appointment was not for any emergency.So there's plenty more to this, but point being that no one can get my records so I can even move on. I now see a new general practitioner, and it's really creating a lot of issues bc no one knows what I've had done before and other relevant information.I'm disabled with complex medical issues, so it's kind of a big deal and preventing care. I can't even get my disability plan of service updated for the county.So I filed a complaint with the state's board of physicians over two months ago, and no one I put on the complaint as witnesses has been contacted. Nothing has happened yet."
did not pay for parking,"Toronto. Close to Yorkville village. I parked in a garage parking lot. Pressed the button, got my ticket, parked. I was gone for 7 hours and my ticket was kept in my MAGNETIC wallet. I came back and I drove my car to the pay area. I inserted my ticket and the machine said it couldn't read it. I suspect the magnet damaged the card. I tried 3 times before hitting the ""help"" button. After pressing the button, the bracade lifted and I slowly drove out. I passed a room that seemed to be the office and nobody was there. I drove away without paying $25 worth of parking.I have a lot of anxiety now. How much legal trouble am I looking at if they review security footage and find the license plate number?"

Florida - Are providers required by law to provide a hard copy of post-op instructions for outpatient procedures?,"A friend of mine had PRK eye surgery, but they gave her post-op instructions for your run of the mill Lasik procedure. The recovery for PRK is a couple weeks where recovery time for Lasik is by and large a couple days.They gave her the post-op instructions for Lasik which were incorrect and insufficient. She is in a not-insignificant amount of pain still and it’s been over a week since the procedure and she’s concerned there is a something to be really worried about.The doctor’s office is telling her that the 10+ year old video that she watch prior to her procedure was sufficient delivery of post-op care, but she maintains that the video covered only Lasik, and not PRK.Is there any recourse here if there is lasting damage due to what seems to be negligence on the part of the doctor’s office?"
Am I able to request my parent's court documents?,"Hi! I'm trying to find out if I can legally make a request to receive a copy of documents for cases my parents were involved with the Florida courts for, specifically Clay county.Unfortunately, I can't trust the information coming from either of my parents about what happened with family law cases they had in the past, including things like the custody agreement for my brother and I, their divorce proceedings, and the events of the court case that led to me living my father.As an adult, I'm trying to find out what really happened back then. Would it be possible to request things like the meeting details at a custody hearing and such from fifteen years ago? Would my parents need to be aware I'm doing it?ETA: Also if anyone knows if it'd be possible to request police records of calls/visits as well, that'd be rad."
Platinum Hotel LV not honoring my reservation/booking due to greed,"I just received this email today basically stating that our reservation made in April is no longer valid because someone else is paying them more for our rooms. It sucks to be cancelled on but especially this last minute (2 weeks) before the huge event, virtually everything is booked up near our shuttle pick up and really expensive.I called them but they are holding their ground. After some googling it seems that hotels can pull this shit I'm assuming if they have enough fine print that allows them to but seems wild / really dirty that this can be allowed.  I can understand if the rooms literally aren't available  (they didn't) but they essentially auctioned out our room without allowing us to even bid.Is there anything I can do legally or anything I can say to pressure them?Edited: Modified part about them having fine print allowing them to do this, they didn't.The email:Good Afternoon,I’m very sorry to inform you we will not be able to accommodate you on October 21-26. We had a very large group extend their stay and rooms will not be available. We did reserve a block of rooms at the Tuscany Hotel right next door to our hotel.

Anyone know the rights a corporation has vs a human?,"I want to know for a project I am doing. If you can point me in the correct direction that would be good tooEdit: ContextI am trying to think of a new way to keep corporations in line by allowing citizens to sue them with ease.

It might not pan out but I want to see the legal differences between a human and a mega corporation.It might not pan out, I think another way to solve the issue is to punish people for using this law frivolously in a way that does not restrict peoples ability to sue but still had a punishment for suing small business’s and regular citizens."
Are employers allowed to access private internet networks?,"Pretty much what the title says.My dad works for a banking institution and deals with sensitive information (credit card numbers, addresses, etc.). Since COVID, he permanently works from home, so he uses our network and a company-provided VPN for his work computer.Ever since he works from home, he’s had this paranoia that our network can be audited by his job, and since he has teenagers (myself included), you can assume the things that are being searched from our private devices. So, he kicked everyone off the internet so that our IP addresses remain spotless. (Which of course, makes no sense, since IP addresses only track geographic location, not browsing history.)My question is: do employers have the right to get access to a private network and do they have the right to obtain browsing history from private (non-work owned) devices?I tell my parents that employers can’t do that (nor would they care) but they do not believe me."

I called them and they stated that they ""do not transfer the warranty but we can rewrite it and it'll be $2500."" So my question is two part I suppose. The contract clearly states ""transfer"" not ""rewrite"" so is that the same? And if they state fees are between that range, can it go above that range?"

"In the Johnny Cash song One Piece At A Time, would the protagonist be charged with one act of grand theft, or thousands of acts of petty theft?","The song details the story of a Cadillac assembly line worker who, fed up with seeing Cadillacs every day knowing he'll never have one of his own, elects to get one outside the law. His plan is to, over the course of two decades, steal one car part every day to ultimately assemble an entire vehicle. He'll get it one piece at a time, and it won't cost him a dime.So-as far as the law is concerned, were Cash arrested after his scheme came to fruition, would he have committed a single act of stealing a vehicle or many thousands of acts of stealing individual pieces? Would he be judged based on the whole of his crime, or the literal sum of its parts?"

Cashiers keeping Customer Receipts,Some of my cashier coworkers keep receipts that customers don't want (or even print duplicate receipts from previous orders) to scan with an app to get money. This seems very sketchy to me and it turns me the wrong way (mainly because these receipts have customers' card information on them). It gets to be to the point where I am noticing the cashiers pocket the receipts from every single customer and their pockets are bulging with receipts. Is this legal? Would this be considered stealing? Or am I worrying about nothing?
Employee funded health insurance (IL),"(IL)Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but long story short….I currently work a government job that offers health insurance that is “self funded” meaning all of the employees insurance premiums along with the employers contributions go into a fund that finances the our medical expenditures throughout the year.It’s managed by a third party insurance company and it’s set up like a typical health insurance plan (deductibles, 80/20, max out of pocket, etc..) Coverage / deductibles are mediocre at best.Every year it seems like our premiums are going up, which is to be expected with the rising cost of healthcare and all, but this year, they skyrocketed (30%-125%) depending on the plan.The county board has a history of borrowing money from the employee funded health fund to finance unexpected projects or expenditures.  They say they pay back the money, but haven’t FOIA’d the documents to prove it.Is it legal for the county board, who’s members aren’t even covered by the employee funded health plan, to use the money for other projects or expenses?  Are their statues in place that regulate the use of these types of funds?Thanks"

Why isn't neonazism treason (at least in the US)?,"According to this, treason includes ""adhering to (the United States') enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere"".

How is it legal for Texas to force you to stay in school after you turn 18?,"I'm 18, a high school senior in Texas looking to drop out. The point of this post isn't to argue whether or not it's a good decision, so let us please refrain from that.Anyways, I though at 18, you are now a legal adult, so how the hell can force you to stay in school until you're 19 years old?I checked the laws and Texas is like the only state that makes you stay in school until you're 19 or graduate. In other states once you're 18 you're an adult and can just stop coming. Seems a bit authoritarian frankly, that they can force you to stay in an institution for 8 hours a day as a legal adult, when you've committed no crime.So my question is, how the hell is that allowed? I'm a legal adult, how can they force me to stay in school? Can they really take an adult to truancy court for not going to school anymore?"

questions about legal validity in a documentary,"If this isn't the right place to post this please refer me to a more appropriate place.  However, I think this works.  I was watching a documentary about Shanann Watts, which happened in Colorado.  At some point after Shanann didn't respond to her friend's texts the friend called the police to check on her.  The cop who showed up didn't seem particularly interested in accessing the house despite an overwhelming lot of suspicious circumstance.  He defaulted back to 'only being able to enter the house with the husband's permission' - which didn't make sense to me, not completely, as it was Shanann's house. I was hoping someone could explain to me why this cop wouldn't investigate the home when everyone around him was saying the circumstances were off- like when the neighbors confirmed Chris Watts was acting weird the cop still insisted only Chris could enter the house.  But at that point there's enough circumstancial stuff to give him probable cause, right?  The other question I had is about the polygraph test.  If they're not admissible in court then how did the dept. fall back on telling Chris he was guilty because of his test?  Was this just a lie to get him to confess?  I realize I didn't include all the details from the documentary, there's a lot though.  I'll elaborate on anything that requires it."
Sister is trying to get personal info from SO for cremation expenses,"Hey all. Due to a family member passing away, SO(the older brother) has been asked by his sister to provide his drivers license, birth certificate and a notarized letter of consent for cremation in order for her (youngest daughter, claiming to have power of attorney over the family member) to claim insurance. Thats what we're guessing anyways.She even stated that giving the info would help her cover the costs of cremation, and she was explaining how expensive it was and it was draining her funds already.He felt uncomfortable dishing out that info to her, to which she replied that he could give it to the woman or government official.He still refused and she became verbally agressive and spoke fast, he tried getting the point across that if she were power of attorney then why would she need his info to make decisions? We learned from the nurses that since he's the eldest that he has overall say and her requesting that made us wonder if she even was PoA. She has had a bad habit of lying these past few agonizing weeks, so understandably he doesn't fully trust her.Does anyone know why she would need that information? And if he had given it to her, what would it do?Thanks!"

Can a USA trademark be awarded as damages?,"I‘m reading of NPE patent cases within my industry where the NPE is suing foreign (typically Chinese) firms.

Call-back hours worked and California overtime laws,"Please explain call-back pay and accrual of overtime in California.I am having a difficult time finding information on this subject and I would like to learn more about it. I am an RN in California, non-union, non-exempt.  To incentivize RNs to work extra, because they've failed to properly staff the entire hospital and there are not enough nurses to care for all the patients, our employer offered (crisis wages) 2xbase pay for any hours worked above your FTE (regular scheduled shifts). They have failed to pay OT and claim they are not required to. Now I am a 12-hour employee so I wouldn't normally accrue OT until after 12 hours on any given day or after 40 hours in a week.The two scenarios in dispute are:1- an employee comes in 4 hours early for they're shift on the crisis wages. They then work their regular 12 hour shift for a total of 16 hours. The last four hours, hours 13 through 16, should be OT. Admin says no because we were paid double for the first 4 hours. In this case the 4hr crisis shift isn't even an incentive because, under normal circumstances, the nurse would only be entitled to 4 hours of double time anyway. The wage owed in the last 4 hours is in question here.2 - I am scheduled to work my regular 12hr shifts Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I work 3 12hr crisis shifts on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday which I am scheduled in advance for because staffing knows we are already short of nurses for patient care. MTW should be the crisis wage; 4 hours of Fridays shift is straight pay and 36 hours should be OT. Admin is refusing to pay any OT.Management has called these crisis shifts ""call-back"" shifts and are claiming the hours worked do not apply to the OT rules. These are actual hours worked in the hospital, not stand-by.Our unit and several others have never been subject to ""call-back"" rules and we are unfamiliar with what this means. Usually our OR and Cath Lab teams work call-back because it cannot be predicted when someone may need emergency surgery or has a heart attack and needs to go to Cath Lab.I understand that California defines call-back as being related to unforeseen circumstances, such as the above mentioned.Our situation is not an unforeseen emergency. Our management is well aware of short staffing weeks in advance and rather than sending a text a couple hours ahead of shift start that they are needing more staff (which has been usual practice but more unpredictable regarding how many RNs would be available on short notice) they have sent out emails of how many shifts need to be filled at any given time during the week as well as when specialty nurses are needed (for instance I am one of a handful that is part of the ""code blue team"").An OR nurse kind of explained how call-back works and they can literally be working over 24 hours straight but not get OT because call-back hours worked don't count toward accrual of overtime hours. How is that legal?"
WA Creating a land trust for a small property outside Seattle,"My partner and I own 1.25 acres of property outside Seattle (Jefferson County) and we want to improve the property by adding electric, septic, water, and a small home.  I currently live in FL, my partner is currently living on the property in an RV.  I have about $100k to invest in the property and found a reasonably priced manufactured home to put on it.  Although I paid for the property (about $30k), my partner's name is on the deed.What we have discussed is putting the property into a land trust to protect the property from creditors and other issues that may affect the property or my home in FL.  My partner agrees with doing the land trust and putting the deed of the property into the trust.  I am in my 60s and expect to retire out there if I live long enough. I want to make sure that my partner keeps rights to the property in case I get run over by a bus.My question is do I need a lawyer for this or is this something I can do myself.  I do have a small business registered in FL, do I need a new business entity in WA to serve as the Trustee?"
would it be possible to get a later abortion in texas as a trans man?,"i'm a trans man who's still capable of getting pregnant in the process of getting a legal gender change.  the word of the new texas law, as far as i can tell, specifically says 'a physician may not knowingly perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant woman'. if i'm legally a man, would i theoretically be able to circumvent that? esp given that, again, as far as i can tell, you don't need bottom surgery to qualify for a legal gender change in texas.i don't live in texas, mind you, it just crossed my mind when i was listening to a podcast."

Can someone end up charged with kidnapping for rescuing an unconscious person and is there statutory or case law on this especially in the US?,"Suppose someone comes across someone who is unconscious but appears to be in trouble in a way where if you just left them there they could get hurt or even die. Maybe they are asleep outside and it's freezing out or there is a storm or even a tornado or even just the expectation of dangerous weather. Or what about if the person is in an area you think of as dangerous or risky to be in because of for example, crime?You try to wake them up but can't. You assume they would want to be rescued and you try to get them somewhere safer. A hospital if possible but maybe there is not one nearby or there is an ongoing natural disaster preventing you from getting them there.On the face of it a charge of kidnapping in this scenario seems insane but it's conceivable since you are technically moving a person without their consent. Has this ever been argued in a court of law and what was the outcome? Are there any statutes to provide a defense in these cases?"
HIPPA and vaccination,"I attempted to do some research myself but trying to navigate the government's HIPPA website to get a simple answer to a simple question was like trying to read the Magna Carta.

Somebody please just help a regular guy with a regular question."
"Curious as to what my rights would, or would not have been in a past near domestic abuse case- long, my sincere apologies.","So several months ago,  I was in a very ugly situation where I was living with my sibling and my in law, his wife, who has several psychiatric diagnosees. Said in law's mental illness is such that she routinely gets explosive fits of rage, and often takes it out (verbally) on other members of the family. I was spared of these attacks, at least in the beginning, but as time went on she began getting increasingly aggressive towards me as well, to the point that one day, she came  very well near actually attacking me. There wasn't physical assault,  but I felt physically threatened for reasons I'll go into more detail over, as she has been screaming very loudly over a very irrational and in actuality minor thing that could have easily been resolved in a calm rational conversation,  but she instead exploded vastly out of proportion to the situation, screaming for several minutes straight, (unprovoked mind you- I hadn't said anything to her prior to this to have set this off; it was in reaction to something minor and trivial that I hadn't even been aware she was mad about that happened days before.) After enduring several minutes of her raging at me, I simply couldn't stand to bear any more of this undue harrassment, and simply told her in a raised voice to stop yelling at me.So, this is the part of the story where I'd like advice as to helping to determine whether what she did from here would have been deemed, from a legal perspective,  outside of her legal rights to do to someone, and whether I could, or should, have possibly pressed charges, or would have had the right to exercise self defense, as I had felt very threatened by what ensued. So after saying this, her aggression sharply increased, where she immediately retaliated by screaming an equally loud and irrational reaction,  this time claiming how ""no one gets to talk to her that way,"" and then began to proceed to walk down the hallway towards me very quickly with this aggressive, angry look on her face and threatening body language.  I wasn't sure what she was going to attempt to do, if anything, but she was clearly beyond rationality at this point, and so I decided that the safest thing to try to do to try to de escalate this, knowing full well the extent of how volatile she gets when angry, would be to go into the nearest bedroom, and close and lock the door and wait until she calmed down, as I honestly judging by her reaction, felt that there was a chance she might try to engage in physical violence.So,  this is the part where I have to wonder, aside from that last bit alone, if what she did could have been construed or classified as legitimate harassment of some kind, and whether I would have had the right to have taken some sort of  action against her had I been able to do so in the moment.So mere moments after I had closed the door and locked it, rather than perhaps shouting through the door to get a last round of digs in before eventually giving up to go fume somewhere silently in a corner at her defeat as one might expect of your more garden variety person with anger problems and abusive tendencies, she instead decided to go full boar ballistic- and began screaming that she was going TO GET THE KEY!!! to unlock the door, with a noteable tinge of manic anger mixed with glee, just so she could presumably continue with this entirely unecessary, over the top, and insane onslaught of unprovoked aggressive behavior.(I sincerely apologize for the length thus far, but to try to sum the rest up:) So she did in fact fulfilling her demented promise by going so far as to actually violate an inherit boundary I had tried to erect in an effort to de escalate the situation by unlocking the door.  She bursted in several moments after making the threat to come in., but there had been enough time between when she screamed about that and when she actually came fumbling around with the key to try to unlock it that I thought I had actually perhaps had a milisecond to take a quick whizz on the toilet of the bathroom that happened to be attached to the bedroom I was in, as I had had to go pretty badly prior to all of this fiasco as it was. I knew I was taking a risk, but I miscalculated how ridiculously fast she woukd be in procuring said key, so before I had eveb enough time to pull up my pants and finish the deed in privacy,  she came barrelling into the room, helping herself right on in, staring me down, with absolutely little to no regard to or concern for the fact that not only had she already been violating boundaries by busting into a bedroom I'd locked to try to disengage from her lunacy, but now my personal space and privacy as well.  So yes, having her fling the door wide open to reveal me sitting on the pot was not only humiliating for me personally, but it at the very least should, at least with regards to any other human being, have presumably been surprising and shocking enough to have stopped her. A NORMAL person, (not to say a normal person would do half of what she did,) but upon seeing someone going to the bathroom, most peopel instinctively panic, and leave immediately out of shock and emmarrassment... knowing that it's just common human decency to give people their space. But no, not with this woman. Instead, the moment she saw this, she continued to just stand there, openly gaping and glaring at me in fact, almost mockingly, seething with an intense anger and hatred, and proceeded to continue the onslaught of verbal harassment while I'm still sitting there, really just wishing she would have the tiniest shred of decency and remorse come up inside  of her, and LEAVE. Feeling more than humiliated and violated at this point, I finally got up, (pulled up my jeans witb her still just standing there watching and slinging virtriolic language) and walked over to confront her, where I made it abundantly clear that I wanted her to get the blank out of the room. As soon as I did so, she blew it off by completely disregarding my request, and continued to just stand there and spew hateful remarks at me, in some attempt to continue to play what had clearly morphed into some demented, sadistic power trip.So, sparing you further details, as this has been long enough as it is, I just want to know if what I've told you thus far would be cause for someone to again have had the legal right to retaliate for the sake of self defense in some fashion against her at that point, to the point where she ended up taking things. For instance, if I had somehow been conveniently carrying pepper spray , would it have been fair for me to have used it on her in this instance, since she had effectively chased after me, and refused to back off, even after asking her to do so, (even though she never officially physically attacked...) could the level of aggression and the harrassment she was clearly demonstrating be considered a justifiable instance of a time where someone could have rightfully employed self defense, whether through this or other means, short of obviously gross physical assault i.e. beating them up?  Should I have simply called the police? If so, at which point in the progression of this chain of events would it have been justifiable and not considered an overreaction- after she broke in, after she came into the bathroom and refused to leave, effectively cornering me... or would either of these instances have been taken seriously enough to have her theoretically apprhended? I'm not likely  going to attempt to do anything after the fact, as obviously there is no actual evidence tgis even  occured and would merely be a ""he said she said"" and I really don't want to have to get involved in the legal process if it's not necessary, but I'm wondering once again from a legal professional's perspective, what I might do.  I am aware of the fact that I can, and have since, written down and documented the event in the small chance that I hear of anythign like this ever happeneing again to present as further evidence, but I'm wondering if there's anythign else that should be done, short of goign to police.  I've heard of mental health wlfare checks and so on, (as well as welfare checks for the otehr members of the household who happen to be living with an abusive person) but I again don't knwo if I should take it there, or if there's any intermediary less intense but still effective thing I could do that was pershaps a bit more anonymous and subtle? Like some mental health agency that works in tandem with law enforcement who could put a record of it on file or something?  Again, I really don't wish to have to go there, but thr thing is that she's also done things like this and worse to her daughter that I saw while living there, and have felt really conflicted about wgetger to report it or not because while she never beat her,, she did scream maliciously at the top of her lungs like she did at me qnd slap her.  Anyhow, I'm  truly sorry this was so long but thank you to anyone whose been patient enough to actually read this and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
Job accepted then offered to someone else,"Posting this on behalf of a friend who does not use Reddit.My friend has been employed for a while and he recently interviewed for a job. He went through several stages and then was offered the job. He accepted the job and the hiring manager said she would reach back out to him shortly to begin the o boarding process. Fast forward almost 3 days later and he gets a call back. The hiring manager said they already hired someone else for the position that he accepted.Does he have any legal recourse here? Or is this a legal — albeit scummy — thing to do? For reference, we live in a right-to-work state in the US."

Failed court ordered drug test,"So when I was 19, I was pulled over with some weed and charged with felony possession. Almost 2 years later I began a non-adjudication program that included scheduled drug tests. A few months ago a friend of mine recommended delta-8 to me, as I couldn’t smoke weed while having regular tests. Today I took a test, and was told the DA needs to speak with me. I go across the hall to the DA, who informs me that I have been failing the last few tests and that if I failed today I would be taken back to jail. I was shocked, and when I got to work and asked the friend about it he then told me that the delta-8 is the same thing as weed and probably caused me to fail my tests, and I’m now certain that I failed today.Is there anything I can do to get a retest, or to at least get some sort of pardon until my next test so I can get this bullshit out of my system?If not, I plan on just leaving to the west coast. I would honestly rather kill myself than go back to jail. I know how hard my life would be. I want to know how likely would it be that MS would issue an out of state arrest warrant?

Is it legal to hack terrorists and steal from them?,"I know in the US it is illegal to hack into someone else's computer, but what if the target was say ISIS or the Taliban and the computer was in a different country? Obviously we don't have an extradition treaty with Afghanistan. Would the US government even care if you stole millions of dollars from terrorists? Technically you would be preventing terrorist acts as that money would otherwise be used to fund terrorist attacks. And what if those terrorists were in America? Say someone discovered the 9/11 attackers beforehand and stole all of their money before calling the FBI to turn them in, would they be in trouble at all or allowed to keep the money?Edit: I ask because this is how Russia operates. Russian hackers are encouraged to attack foreign countries and are left alone as long as they don't target anyone in Russia. That's why so many hacks originate in Russia these days."

"Housing subdivision restrictions. No HOA exists, developer dissolved. Who can enforce restrictions?","I live in a small housing subdivision (11 lots). When the subdivision was initially developed (1997), the developer recorded subdivision restrictions with the county register of deeds. The restrictions are pretty thorough and well written. The restrictions state that they will be valid for 50 years and that after 50 years, a 75% vote from residents could be used to amend/change the restrictions. The developer has since dissolved and is no longer in operation, and an HOA was never created.The problem is that one of the land owners has utilized a vacant lot to cut in a driveway solely to access another piece of property in another subdivision. This has created a substantial increase in vehicle traffic and noise on what was previously a quiet dead end road.The subdivision restrictions contain the following relevant restrictions:No lot shall be used except for residential purposes.No property is to be used to access another property.Enforcement shall be by proceedings at law or in equity against the violator.Failure of the developer or any resident to enforce any restriction shall in no way be deemed a waiver of the right to do so."

Should I call the police to question me early?,"Ok so I'm not going to go overboard detailing the situation but in essence some drama happened between my mom and the foster child that was there. She was kicked out for violating her terms with her parents and for then writing a nasty email about how my mother lied/forced her to lie for them and just a bunch of other blatant accusations. Nothing came of it and she wasn't allowed back so she tipped my mom off to C.P.S. claiming she provided, bought, and smoked weed with me and my sister. Me and my sister both smoke pot. My mom has her medical card and keeps everything to herself. She doesn't even like us knowing about it. But the police came today and walked through the house and had found parafanelia and roaches in my sister's room. They now have to like legitimately investigate now and I believe it's an actual case now. She left my phone number as a reference since I lived there up until about 2 months ago. I know what questions they're going to ask, but I don't know when, and I don't want them showing up at where I'm staying because it would make the residence I'm staying in, upset (they don't like police idk). Should I call the police department to see if I can just get everything out of the way? Or should I let them just call or show up because it would seem like we're conspiricising or something?

She had it better than what I did up until I moved out and she threw it all down the drain because she was angry about the system. I'm just very stressed about this. My mom could loose my sister and with everything that's already going on in her life, i know it would devastate her to a point that idk she'd come back from. She's got alot on her shoulders and this whole thing is already got her in tears spamming my phone while I'm at work freaking the hell out. Just any advice would help. Thank you :)."

I was unhappy with the situation surrounding my moving out as well as the way I was asked for the key back (they threatened police if I refused without even giving me the chance to do so), so while mentally going over the situation in my head days later, I thought, ""Would I even have been legally required to comply with that demand?""

Why isn't this considered discrimination or against the law?,"We can all agree that treating someone differently based on their race, gender, ethnicity, etc. is considered discrimination. One clear example of this is if a shop-owner refuses to serve customers of a certain skin color. They would rightly be called a racist, and they would either have to serve them or their shop would be forced to be closed. However, I was thinking, why isn't the reverse treated the same way? If a customer refuses to ever shop at any place whose owner is of a certain skin color, nothing would happen. They wouldn't be forced to shop at those places and there's nothing illegal about what they do (even though most would probably agree it's still racist).Take another example--if a landlord refuses to rent to tenants of color, then that would again be rightly condemned and against the law. However, if a tenant refuses to rent from a landlord solely due to the color of their skin, then that's fine. They can just find another landlord and nothing would happen. What they're doing isn't against any law. I feel like there's a double standard here...do you agree? What do you guys think?"
Medical malpractice question,"I gave birth to my son when I was 24 weeks pregnant.

Question about tenant rights without lease/mortgage,"I'm gonna give you the details but there is a TLDR at the bottom.My mother has been in a bad situation for awhile now. I'm going to run down the situation as concisely as I can. A couple of years ago my brother (44 yrs old) moved in with my parents. He ended up getting back into drugs. Fast forward a couple of years, my dad has since died and, and before he died, my brother managed to bleed my parents completely dry. He stole everything, ruined their credit, etc. I'll spare you the nasty details. They kicked him out shortly before my dad died, but a couple of months after his death, my mom let him move back in. She told me (I live halfway across the continent) he wasn't doing drugs and that he was giving her his paychecks. He bled her dry then convinced her she needed him to survive.I've known it to be bullshit for a long time but there was nothing I could do.Well, my mom called me the other day asking for help making a car payment. We haven't talked much since my dad died because she has been depressed and reclusive.

I also woke up to texts this morning telling me how abusive my brother is, how she would call when she could but not to reply to texts because he is monitoring her phone.I have a plan to get my mom out, sell her home, and give her financial breathing room.First things first: Gotta get the brother out of the house. If she said ""leave"" he would not.What rights does he have, having lived there for awhile? He is not on the mortgage and does not have a lease. Could she just call the cops if he did not leave?TLDR: Can we legally kick my abusive junkie brother out of my mom's home or does he have some tenant rights having lived there for awhile?"
"When language similar to ""crime against nature"" is used in a criminal law does that render the unnaturalness as an element of the offense and hypothetically would a defense based on the act being natural be a valid defense that could be argued in court?","For instance suppose Lawrence hadn't been decided yet and a statue refers to ""unnatural carnal acts with mankind"". The defense tries to argue that the defendants are innocent because while they committed ""carnal acts with mankind"" they were committing ""natural carnal acts"" making them not guilty of ""unnatural carnal acts"". The defense then seeks to ask to call forth scientists to argue in court that homosexuality has a biological basis and is therefore ""natural"" and since the law only prescribes penalties for the act when it is unnatural that the defendant is innocent.Why was this strategy never tried before Lawrence (or was it?) and how would a judge react if it were tried? Would this be allowed to be argued in court at all and would it possibly work?"
If a group of people plan to do something believing it to be legal and then learn it's actually illegal and then don't do it are they still guilty of conspiracy? And does it matter if checking the legality before proceeding was originally part of the plan?,
UPDATE - How to deal with non-responsive company in arbitration or small-claims?,"6 days ago I wrote about my difficulties getting in touch with SmugMug/Flickr in order to dispute my membership being cancelledhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskLegal/comments/p38eez/how_to_deal_with_nonresponsive_company_in//u/calsosta gave some good advice to make a google/LinkedIn search, and, after I did that, I managed to find the ""general counsel"" for SmugMug/Flickr, and then, with their name, could find their contact info on the ""State Bar of California"" website. I reached out to them with this public contact info to inform them about my having opened an arbitration dispute and how the AAA and myself wanted to get in touch with them to continue the process. I must have found the correct person because 24 hours later I received the following email:We are aware that you have attempted to contact our legal counsel outside of the customer support channel and have derived and collected certain personal data about this individual. You are hereby asked to immediately cease and desist from contacting any Flickr employee or member in regards to your matter outside of the support desk.We have also received your demand for arbitration. We are in direct communication with the AAA on this matter. Please be advised that Flickr reserves the right to pursue all legal rights and remedies available to us due to your breach of our terms.As you have submitted a demand for arbitration, we will not be communicating with you further via the support desk. We consider this matter closed.so, with the help from this sub and it's helpful users, and some perseverance, we move on to the next step. Let's see how that goes...."
Cell phone agreement,"TL:DR Cell phone agreement discloses some fees in the body of the agreement, but is he restocking fee is linked to a webpage outside the contract itself. Enforceable?The agreement does not mention anything about a restocking fee for returning the cell phone during the free trial period. Rather they put a link to their website where it describes the fee. I have the sales rep on a recorded line stating there are no other fees and it is 100% risk and expense free if I decide to cancel with the 14 day trial period.  The fact that they do not mention restocking fee within the sales contract gives me hope that I can fight to get credited for the restocking fee. Further what is stopping the carrier from changing the webpage after signing the documents? There is nothing tying my contract to the fee amount on their webpage. Any advice or previous experiences is much appreciated."

What happens to property lines when a fault line (like the San Andreas fault) shifts?,"Most shifts are just a few centimeters, but that isn't always the case. I read that parts of the San Andreas Fault shifted 21 feet during the 1906 quake.So if a property crosses a fault line, does the property become ""staggered""?  Do owners ""shave off"" portions of their property, and sell them to their neighbors, thus keeping their property shape/outline?  Do surveys need to be conducted every time a fault line shifts to reestablish ownership?"

How to deal with non-responsive company in arbitration or small-claims?,"Hello all, I am asking in order to get some information about how to proceed. I have been a Flickr PRO member for a few years, earlier this year my membership was revoked by Flickr for ""breaking terms & conditions"", and locked me completely out of my account and thereby locking me out of ALL of my photos, and whereas I have an idea why this could have happened, when I have attempted to contact them to amicably deal with the situation I get zero response other than a ""this happened and we do not give out details regarding membership revokes"".Under their terms & conditions while they have stated their right to at any time revoke a membership they have also given the possibility to enter into dispute arbitration via the AAA. I am based in the EU and had no idea how this would work so I spent a couple of weeks sending messages to Flickr (email, support form, Twitter support) asking ""how do we get this started?"" - zero response. So, I finally figured out the arbitration website, filled out their consumer arbitration form, included all my info, paid the fee and opened a case. The case was accepted and is being processed - but still ZERO response by Flickr. I hunted for their mail address because I needed to send them a registered letter with all the filed paperwork, and although I think I found the right one (nothing on their actual website) the letter has been waiting to be picked up for 2 weeks now.So, the AAA has sent two reminders to Flickr to please respond, and I have a feeling that they won't. If the arbitration process fails, then, apparently I can take Flickr to small-claims court in California. I have NO idea if that will make them respond, or even how to get in touch to tell them that I am going to do that. How does this work with a completely non-responsive company?I would be happy with either re-opening my account, or giving me a chance to remove my photos - but I can't get anywhere if they don't respond...thanks for any info."
"I do furniture assembly for iIkea, they have a new company policy that says I have to anchor all the furniture I assemble and if the customer refuses I’m supposed to abandon the job or I can be held liable for tipping injuries. Is this true?","So as the title says this new ikea policy says that if a piece of furniture can be anchored to a wall, I’m required to anchor it. Even little things like nightstands. If the customer doesn’t want me to put holes in the walls then I’m supposed to tell them I can’t do the job and I have to leave.The problem is 9/10 customers don’t want things anchored. If I just leave all of my jobs I won’t make any money, (I get a small cancellation fee if the customer refuses vs getting paid for the whole job).I’ve been getting around this by having the customer agree in writing that they don’t want me to anchor the item and that they will anchor it themselves when they are able. I do this through the chat function in the app they use to hire us. These chats are archived.We are allowed to make other business agreements through the chat function such as price negotiations and adding additional costs. If the customer agrees in the chat then the company backs it up.So my question is, if a customer agrees in writing to have me leave an item un-anchored, and then an item falls over causing injury or damage, can I actually be held liable?"

"My estranged, mentally ill father committed suicide but before he died, his wife convinced him to change his will to remove both of his biological children and leave everything to his wife. Can we fight this?","My father committed suicide recently. He was and had been mentally ill for the last 20 to 25 years. He was unable to work and unable to care for himself on most days. When my sibling and I were young, he divorced my mother and married a woman with a small child and promised everything to her and her child if she took care of him. I don't know how much money was ultimately given to my father from his own father's estate but it was in the millions. I'd guess like 1-3 or something like that. My father had tried to convince me to drop out of college to care for him and when I refused, he cut me out of his life. My sibling was cut out of his life soon afterwards. He was a nightmare to deal with after he became ill, he only cared for himself and would willingly bring everyone else down around him. I remember the good times from before he got sick, moreso than my sibling does. They were younger and can only remember pain and suffering so they are only feeling anger now that we were completely removed from the will on top of the abandonment and pain we have already suffered at his hands. I haven't seen the will but my father's wife told us that ""they removed us from the will a few years ago"". Again, we had not spoken to these people for 15+ years because our father stopped speaking to us and changed his contact information. We thought he hated us and it seems like he didn't give too much of a shit about us, in whatever mental capacity he possessed. I'm sure the wife had something to do with having us removed, my father wouldn't have completed such a task on his own. Regardless, I'm not the one who wants to fight for this money. I feel like his entire family let us down and I don't need the money but then I've got a job and don't really consider myself to need or want too much, it is tainted and I'd be OK without it. But my sibling is adamant that we try to see if we can get our fair share somehow. The will would have been changed after my father was on social security disability for his mental illness. Can someone who is mentally ill really be allowed to change their will on their own? And if his wife did it, is that legal!? Does she need to provide proof of some kind that she could make such a change for him? My ultimate question is.. does my sibling have any chance here to recover some of the inheritance? Or is this just a waste of time. I personally am not getting involved or trying to chase lawyers down or emotionally fatigue myself. But I will stand by my sibling in their decision if it requires my cooperation somehow. My sibling did briefly speak to some attorney and they did say we might have a chance but would need to pay a retainer fee of like $1500 to start something.. I just worry this is a waste of their time and energy. I don't want them fighting in courts for years and years. That seems like such a lose-lose scenario. Please give your honest input here, I will pass the responses along. I appreciate it!!"

After changing the coolant the engine is still overheating, I contacted the mechanic and asked if he would still honor his warranty, he said ""you should have brought it in earlier""I know the timing is terrible, but the car has not moved since I parked it and the engine obviously has a leak in the coolant system. Unfortunately, I do not have anything in writing about the warranty I do have the invoices.Is there anything I can do?"

"Cross post: pets, just need to vent","A little over a year ago I was hospitalized for 2 weeks due to mental health reasons (it was due to ptsd, i am a 100% service connected disabled veteran). My dog, Lana (3yrs, f, lab/pit mix) was left in the care of my ex husband (divorced in 2014) while i was in patient. I didn't have anyone else to take her in and could not afford to board her. My ex assured me that my dog would be ok and that he would give her back to me when i was out of the hospital over phone calls when i was in patient. By the time i had gotten out of the hospital he had moved to a different state. He assured me that he was still going to bring my dog back to me. After giving me the reassurance, he began ignoring my calls and texts. We also have a 13 yr old son together so i was getting authorities involved over not having any contact with my son, when he finally told me that my dog was gone. She had gotten out of his home and run off. He hadn't seen her in at least a week. Look, it's been just over a year and i just found out less than a week ago that he LIED to me. My dog is ALIVE. My son is visiting with me for the summer and his phone has photos of my dog (service animal) cuddled up with my ex 5 months after he told me she disappeared. I have filed a police report, but he lives out of state so getting him arrested isn't going to happen. The police report will be available to me next week and he has admitted that it is my dog, he admitted that he took her from me. He is claiming that i abandoned my dog when i went in patient. I am already aware that that won't hold up for shit. Now, the only reason i believed it to begin with is because our son told me he had not seen my dog at his dad's. After i showed my son the pictures he confessed that he was instructed to lie to me by his father and he was scared of what his dad would do to him if he told me the truth. I just really needed to vent this because i am so damn frustrated over it. Why keep my dog from me? Before i fiked the police report i told him to just give me my dog back and he denied having her. Then when the police questioned him he admitted the truth. The pictures i have seen of my dog since being in his care show that she is very over weight and she has large bald spots and scabs from ripping out her fur. The pictures are as recent as may 2021, right before my son came to visit with me. I am so happy that my dog is alive, and at the same time devastated that i have to now SUE him to get her back.i live in the usa, louisiana, he is in texas, i have reached out to the LA bar association to see if i can get any assistance or if they can at least point me in the right direction*"

I asked to escalate the call to a supervisor who briskly told me he is aware of the law but will not help and then hung up.

Child pornography and pedophilia in mainstream movies??,I was shocked to find out that Simonetta Steffanelli was either 16 or 17 when she was topless in the godfather (1972).

"My drivers license says I'm 5ft4, but I'm actually 5ft10. Can I go to jail for this?","Hi,When I was doing the processing stuff for getting my drivers license, I told the BMV that I was 5 ft 4.The reason I did this is because I have never measured myself since middle school gym class. Also apparently 5 ft 4 is way shorter than I thought it was, which is crazy because I don't feel like I've grown that much in my head.Months later, I told one of my friend about this experience. She started laughing and said it was impossible for me to be 5 ft 4 because she's 5 ft 10 and we're the same height.btw I still have never measured myself. I am only going off of this because I trust women.What my friend said has sat in the back of my head for a really long time. I need to know if I can suffer any legal consequences for essentially lying about my height. Will I have to keep lying about my height   indefinitely when I have to renew my license just to keep up the consistency?Thank you for your time."

Left hostile work environment - apply for unemployment?,"I recently quit my job after 2 years due to an extremely hostile work environment. I even required a lawyer at the end to terminate the relationship earlier than expected per contract. It’s been a few weeks and so far I’m really struggling. I was hoping to jump right back into the workforce, but I’m realizing I may need more time to regenerate and reboot. As a result, I’d like to apply for unemployment (in New Jersey). Any tips? Anyone with personal experience applying for unemployment in the setting of hostile work environment? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you."
What financial obligation does an advocacy group have?,"I'm in Florida, the advocacy group is focused on USA national policy, based in LA. Not sure what that does for jurisdiction.I've been donating monthly to a group that claims to advocate for a specific policy that I support and I truly hope the gov will implement. However, it just dawned on me that I have no idea what they're using my money for, specifically. Is there a way for me to see their books or some summary? I cannot find anything on their website and they have not responded to my emails. I'm not sure if they're officially a non-profit or not (I know there are lots of options and it honestly confuses me), does this make a difference?Also, I realized that ""advocacy"" or ""lobbying"" is essentially just paying someone to talk to lawmakers. Say they WERE to open their books to me and I see that they paid Mr. X all the donated money. How do I know Mr. X is doing anything?Essentially, what can I find out about how they spend my money and what they do? And what rights do I have if I feel that they aren't doing what they promised?"

Non Competition job contract,"Need some advice, I was offered another position within another company outside of my own in a similar field, but I’m currently under contract for noncompetition, if I was to leave my current job for the other, do companies actually seek out litigation on ex employees, and what are the odds of them winning against you?"

The other night i got a message from a repo man about voluntary surrendering my car. Never done such a thing. So i told him no, i didnt. He said he would wait till i contact the bank, he repod it this morning when i was asleep then lied about it over the phone, i contacted police fearing my car was stolen. Turns out he repossessed it, and i called the bank and they said it was voluntarily surrendered. But again never signed anything or said anything to the bankI apologize if this is a mess and spelling, its 1pm and its been a long day"
Does the law allow someone to keep a company laptop sent from a company they don't work for?,"Title is confusing, but here's the gist:I work for an IT consultation company (and MSP) and we have a client that was working with a person to potentially hire them for remote work. The person lives in another state and they were working their way through the hiring process. The person backed out before the end of the process and decided they don't want to work for the company, but the company had already shipped them a laptop. It was signed for and received a couple weeks ago, but the person has gone completely no-contact. Won't respond to calls or emails or anything to attempt to retrieve the laptop.My coworkers believe this falls under the ""you're not obligated to return anything a company sends you unasked for"" - the one that covers you if, say, Amazon sends you a package you didn't ask for or someone tries to send you a product and then charge you for it unrequested.I believe that doesn't apply, as it seems to only apply to merchandise and items where the expectation is a purchase. This is someone who was issued a company laptop but backed out of working for the company before docs were signed. My coworkers argument is that the rule still applies here because it's not something this person asked for (since she doesn't work there) and received it unrequested.Any insight on this or how it could play out?Edit to add: as mentioned this is also across state lines so that may play a factor as well."
Company I used to work for is in route to an IPO,"So years ago after working for a food manufacturer for years they announced that they were going to give employees shares in the company. Depending the role you had in the company and the amount of time you spent there influenced the amount of ""shares"" you were to get if the company went public. Just recently a paper released that this company I used to work for is possibly in line to go file under an IPO.I was guaranteed a specific amount of shares in this event but the problem is that the only thing I had been provided, like all of us, was a paper that stated how many we were going to be given. The paper is not in front of me and I think it is with my EX at my old house. I would assume this is a reasonable amount of money that was basically typed on a piece of printer paper and hoped to be lost. In the event I can not find said promise letter is that going to jeopardize any sort of investment I had? I would call the company but I figure that would not get me far because I was let go and that these guy probably did not keep any sort of record at all on this matter because I think my mother contacted them years ago when I was in the hospital to ask about these ""shares"" and they said that they were going to 'send' something in the mail but that never happened.Has my 8 years of time and investment with this company lost or is there a legal way to pursue this?"

[CA] Neighbor complaining about smell coming from kitchen vent,"Hi all,I'm in Los Angeles, CA, and my neighbor has been complaining about the cooking smells coming from my apartment for over a year now. I have tried to troubleshoot and be accommodating to her by not using the cooking fan until my unit was assessed and having the HOA send maintenance staff to check my apartment. Previously, she said that she would invite an HVAC specialist to inspect the units back in October 2020, and I said that I can be available whenever the appointment is scheduled, but she never followed up with me. The maintenance staff inspected my unit in November 2020 and told me that the vent was taped correctly. A couple weeks ago, she brought up the issue again to the HOA board and the HOA sent the maintenance staff again to check on my unit and to inspect her unit for any breaks or leakage in the vents. The maintenance person said that there was no issue on my side and reported back to me that he saw no leakage in her unit. He said that because the building is built with a shared venting system, the smell is leaking into her unit and an easy solve would be to install a carbon filter on either her side or my side. Last night, I was cooking and my neighbor knocked on my door and told me that the issue has not been resolved yet and I had to turn my cooking vent off. I immediately turned it off. Later, I saw that she sent a text to me and the HOA president stating that this was still a persisting issue and I was not to use the cooking vent until this issue was resolved. I wrote back to her and said that the maintenance staff confirmed that it was an issue with the building and not my unit. She claims that she has been living here for 25 years and had no issues until I moved in and renovated my unit. Now she says that she will be retaining an attorney and ask that I cease and desist.Currently, I am trying to contact my HOA president to see what his take on the issue is and if there will be a formal report in place, documenting the assessment of my unit. I wanted to ask, does she have grounds for a case here? Do I need to seek legal counsel?Thank you for your time. I really appreciate your help on this."
Unhappy Living Situation,"I live in Alberta, Canada. For the last 8 months I have been living with someone that I no longer want to live with, he most definitely has worn out his welcome. He had a sob story about how he had nowhere to go.He said he would pay $400 a month to stay. Out of the 8 months he has only paid for the last 3.5 months. I rent an apartment and it’s leased under me and only me. I could get evicted if it was found out that he was staying with me.Furthermore, about a year or more ago he was living on his own but didn’t have a legal address. He asked if he could use my address to have “one” thing mailed out… turns out he tricked me and now he has been using my mailing address. I don’t want to call the cops and get him in trouble. I’m worried if I go to my Landlord for help, that I just may end up evicted.I have asked him to leave several times but to no avail. The times I asked him to leave were, on my part, were idle threats but now I am at my wits end.I sure hope someone out there has some advice."

What am I entitled to for diminished value of my vehicle?,"I live in KY. My 2013 vehicle was backed into three years ago and caused $3,800 in damage.  The at fault party’s insurance paid for the repairs. I traded the car in and got about $2,000 less than the blue book.  The accident history was cited as the reason.I just found out about diminished value claims.  I placed one with the insurance company and they initially said they weren’t going to pay anything because the car was “so old.”Is it their judgment on what to pay?  What am I entitled to?"
Property Law- Biohazard Cleanup,"Hi,  first ever post here, so sorry if I do this wrong, but I need help! I work for a company in Florida that cleans up biohazard losses. We were contacted by a woman's niece. The woman had passed away in her apartment and wasn't discovered for nearly two weeks. The property management advised the niece that she'd be financially responsible for cleanup. Cleanup in this case would involve cutting out carpet and drywall that's been affected by bio waste. Ordinarily for losses in apartments, carpet and drywall is something the prop manager would have to approve since they own those materials.My question is, who would be responsible for payment in this situation?We haven't done work yet, our hope is that we can just retrieve any belongings for the family and they can cut ties with the apartment complex without footing the bill for any cleanup."
Is it legal to secretly record audio of your coworkers in a private dental office?,"I’m having an issue with a coworker for a little over a year now. Our boss finally hired an HR department so my other coworkers are encouraging me to call them about emotional and verbal abuse as well as harassment. During our “mediation” meeting with the doctors last night, I mentioned that I write down all of our encounters in my notepad to keep track so I can use them if needed. However, this coworkers interrupted and said she has audio recordings of all of our encounters and conversations and supposed proof that she’s actually the victim. I live in Arizona where the laws are weird so I don’t now what to do. If she does have this audio, I believe it could potentially show just how bad our encounters are. I did ask for her to play them at this meeting and she said she couldn’t. I’m finally ready to go to HR about this now that I’ve put in my two week notice, but I want to make sure this stops happening to the other girls. We’ve have more than five people quit within their first few weeks of training because of her bullying. Everyone refuses to work with her alone other than me. And every single person that has worked here has broken down and cried from the things she says and does. I just want this to stop."
"$40,000 and an EVIL Babies Mama... Am I fucked?","So my father died when I was 24 years old and in his will he left both my sister and I each $175,000 but in the will he stated that I was NOT to receive the money until I turned 40 years old. Well my sister gave it to me anyways because she was in charge of all that stuff and didn't want to deal with it.Long story short, I was dating a woman who had my baby and we had a verbal contract stating that if I gave her $40,000 then she would stop claiming child support on me. (She tricked me into letting her claim child support while she was living in a duplex with me while I worked and paid the rent). I owed like only $2000 when I got the money and she said that she would stop claiming child support but all she did was go down to the Child Support Office and told them that I no longer lived at my address and she had no idea where I was at, so I stopped receiving the bills in the mail stating that I owed this amount of child support so I believed she stopped claiming itWell later when I was broke I had overpaid the Child Support Office one time when the last letter I got stated I owed $2000 and I got a letter stating I overpaid by $1500 and I could go down to the office and get my check, well... When I went down there they said ""yeah you did overpay us but she never stopped claiming... so as of now you owe $5000+ dollars, do you want us to credit the $1500 to the amount that you owe?""So my question is... Is there any way that I can show bank statements showing the money I took out and tell them about the contract because I have witnesses that are willing to testify on my behalf who heard and watched us make that verbal agreement?"
How much to charge for engineering book rights?,I hope this is a good place to ask this and apologize if it's not.I co-authored an engineering book that has since gone out of print and the rights to the book reverted back to me and my co-author.

Is downloading Youtube videos illegal if its from a channel intending to make profits on them esp through views but the vids aren't copyrighted or under some legal protection?,"For example there are some videos I want to download from  the channel Skallagram.  AFAIK the video host of the Skallagram even though he makes money as a Youtuber because he's so popular, hasn't gotten a patent or some other legal shield for his video and thus his videos lack the power of the law. SO if I download his stuff, does that mean I won't get an ISP notice? That I won't have to worry about getting sued from the creator?So any popular Youtubr like Markiplier, I won't get in trouble because most of them haven't done trademaks?"
What’s a good thing that someone who wants to go to law school can do while still in high school,
Long one: I’m in my early 20s and recently got into a physical fight with my dad (he attacked first). Long story short I ended up at my grandparents then stupidly decided to walk back to my RV….,"…my RV (on parents property) with a few cuts on my arm (I inflicted two of them mainly from anger) that came about mainly from the fight.So, a cop pulls up alongside me and inquires about the cuts. I tell him the truth (worst decision if you only cut for the aesthetic) he then calls an ambulance (cool cop though), I then get stuck in a psychiatric ward for 9 damn days. I didn’t try to commit suicide I was just angry at the thought of regressing.PARENTS: My parents are an odd bunch, they like control and seem more akin to NPCs than humans (bad reasoning). The psychiatrist at the ward was almost corrupt, I could only really leave if I agreed to go to a rehab facility (no drug addiction, only occasional alcohol use). Well 15 days is the max but once I said I would go he let me out and said that’s what he was waiting for.How is that legal? They made bank off my Medicaid too. Long story short again, my parents pick me up and they expect me to go to rehab. I vehemently object then they kick me out of the car, I walk back to my grandparents (8 miles).Now during all of his I had social service people come to me about the abuse I’ve endured from my dad. He kicked me out 14 times from 15-17 years old. And he attacked me first during that fight for no reason other than impulsivity. I can apparently press chargers on him (I called social services today but they didn’t have a case on me).I have iPod (coordinates)proof of being kicked out 7 of the 14 times, and audio of a convo in which he admits it. They tried getting a court order to force me to go to rehab (30 days) but apparently couldn’t because of the abusive chargers on my dad (that’s why I know I could press chargers on him, my mother was pissed).So now the only way I can escape my grandparents 18th century home to go back to the RV(all of my stuff is there) and finally finish school is to go to a counseling/rehab place. They have given me lots of papers to sign but I’m too paranoid about it being some trap.They forced me to sign papers for another rehab place when I was 16 for guess what? Liking chemistry but they thought I was making meth or bombs lol. My parents won’t give me my stuff nor money, I’m just scared if I press chargers I’ll be left homeless or even worse they start press charges on me for “illegal “ items like a old weed pipe. They might just make up stuff.What are my best options? I am sorry for the disorganized writing I’m on mobile (I don’t have my computers, no WiFi either).Oh and my dad called the cops when I was pinning him down, they came and just broke it up. I never told them he hit first but somehow it’s on the report, and their the ones who took me to my grandparents (parents took car)."
"Potential buyer issued NOI, now what?","So were going through a divorce and need liquidity, so I'm selling an investment property I never got around to. I went through one of those we buy houses things to get it over quickly.. The guy seemed alright and initially accepted my asking price, we both signed the contract for that price, and he said the inspector would be by in a week or two.Fast forward nearly a month, he comes back with an extremely low counteroffer, I talk him back up a bit but still no where near what I needed to get out of it. I didnt sign anything after the initiatal contract despite hesitantly agreeing verbally to the counteroffer. I never even received any paperwork regarding the counteroffer.Two days later he started pestering me for the deed, and I told him I didn't want to go forward as I know I can get what I'm asking. He said something along the lines of ""no hard feelings, but when you go to sell it, you'll have to go through me as I've issued a memorandum of interest.""The one thing I wish I hadn't done is told him I had someone who was willing to pay my asking price, I feel like that really soured things.The kicker is, I now have a buyer lined up and can't seem to get a hold of the WBH guy.Link to the contract: https://imgur.com/gallery/khFAOhq"
What is considered fair use vs trademarked for things like t-shirts or other merchandise,"Just a little bit of background. My wife is an artist who paints all kinds of realistic and surrealistic paintings. She has done a series of paintings of things like fish, food menus, iconic movie scenes. One of the things she also does is paintings with cars. About a year ago we decided to start putting her artwork on t-shirts using online marketplaces like RedBubble, Threadless and Teespring. This is where we started running into problems. As paintings, her pieces are fair use. They are truly her designs and portray scenes like a surf van or an old golf. But we seem to be running into a fair use gray area with merchandising. VW, Volvo and other car companies have filed to remove her artwork from our online stores. At first we thought it had to do with the titles and tags since they did have the names of the cars, but then they started filing takedown notices for things like ""Surf Trip"" which is a design of highly customized van with surfboards on top that was inspired by a VW bus. This piece at no point had the VW trademarks or any badging or logos. It depicts a van that was inspired by a VW Vanagon but is altered in ways that VW never produced. So that piece still got taken down.Redbubble and these merchants are no help here. They just act like a proxy. They will take down a piece and then if we want to dispute it, they just put us directly in touch with the complainer and we are to work it out. Since were really not making any money yet off these pieces, we have steered clear of getting into any legal battles, but what we really could use is some guidance here.When it comes to artwork, the fact that its an artists own rendition (not just a copy of a photo or a copy-written design)  is enough to classify it as fair use, but with merchandising we're swimming a little blind. Can anyone clarify for us what would be the line between, its a tshirt thats featuring an artists own design that happens to have a car in it, vs its a shirt that infringes on trademarks due to the presence of the car. We posed this question to the support staff but got no meaningful answers, and looking through these websites a TON of very questionable content is on there which begs the question, what is OK?"

How to get refund/ be released from contract for services never rendered,"I signed up for laser hair removal service cos a virtual consultation on June 24th. I signed the contract through DocuSign- and there is no cancellation clause in their contract.I was told that if I couldn’t receive services (medically or if nurse deemed me not a good fit once seeing me) I could transfer the services to enough body part or get out of contract.After my first appt, the nurse said I was not a good fit- that my hair wouldn’t be picked up by laser anywhere on my body. She said that she needed to talk to manager to see if I could get of contract but it wasn’t guaranteed. I have put 400$ down and my monthly payments of 130$ are supposed to start July 30th (16 payments).I have not heard back from anyone after multiple calls- and was told my case was still being reviewed.

Are estates responsible for upkeep of property?,"Who (if anyone) would be responsible for upkeep on a condemned property with an occupant. There is a structure near a place we are renting for the month. No running water, no electricity, the structure is over grown inside and out with weeds, the massive holes in the roof are covered with cardboard or tarps. The occupant is in jail for the next two weeks on harassment charges. I guess the nextdoor neighbors got tired of him pouring his pee bottles out in their yard, among other disgusting things. I’m renting a home nearby and wasn’t aware a person lived in this building until I saw police talking with him. I asked around and apparently the property is in a trust which has made all payments for taxes, trash pickup, etc. My question is, if the house has already been condemned (the notice is plastered to a window) who is responsible for it? Will the Estate need to bring it up to code or pay to have it torn down? If the neighbors filed a civil suit over harassment would it be against the occupant or the estate? Why would the state continue to collect taxes, knowing this man’s life is at risk by continuing to live there? This seems incredibly over complicated. I’m sure there’s tons of red tape but obviously the Estate Lawyer doesn’t care he’s living in squalor, the neighbors have had enough and this man definitely needs help."

Stimulus Payment to Deceased account - Georgia,"Hi,My dad's checking account (sole owner) received the last 2 stimulus payments. He passed last September.

Nothing being done about reported animal neglect,"Dallas County Iowa USA, I just moved here 2 months ago.The neighbors neglect their 3 horses. They are tied to trees in their yard by a 15 or so foot rope. They seem to be rotated to different trees every other week to eat the grass. The yard is maybe 1 acre. None of the grass within reach of the horses grows back taller than a short mow. I have never seen them supplemented with hay or grain. I have never seen them with access to any water. They are left tied to their trees in the sun, thunder and lighting, hail, rain, and snow.  They are thin and not wearing horse shoes, so their hooves are long and cracked. The youngest child there is very chatty and has given additional details. Apparently they want to breed one of them, one of them is considered ""stupid"" so she is rotated to fresh grass less often, and he likes to feed the horses his leftover top Ramen noodles. They had another horse who was put down because its leg was tangled in wires that were for some reason in the small stall they have. The horses are also tied to the far side of the house on occasion but ""get in trouble"" because they eat the piles of household garbage stored there.I suspect the people living there might be friends with the one sherif/cop who has anything to do with our town. I suspect this because other reports have been made, nothing has been done of the course of the past few years. From what I can tell, the cop goes over, chit chats, and leaves. How do I force action? I made an anonymous report today. I feel like such a bad person for this, but they are just neglectful people. The state of the children's wellbeing is questionable, but I have no proof of abuse. I'm nervous to report them because I don't want to be a homewrecker just because they are poor.What more can I do?UPDATE: The squeaky wheel gets the grease. After reporting again, the sherif and deputy have come out to talk with the neighbors. They assessed the animals and had a long conversation with the woman about them. The cops called me back and explained a few things. Firstly, she lied through her teeth about the treatment of the animals. According to her, they are regularly fed and rotated. They always have water, and they are put in the barn at night. The officer has told me to document everything I see, to not remain anonymous, and to call back regularly so that evidence may build. He was apauled at the conditions of the horses as well, but has no way of taking action without records and tangible evidence. I will do what I can. Hopefully they just wake up and take care of them. Time will tell."

I’d say zoom 6 to 8 weeks, we do RXxs, {mostly benzos, like my primary care did)  and sometimes I feel a bit groggy om the newer drugs. She think Benzos and valium are addictive and they’re the next opium.So… I was supposed to see her in person last week, but I didn’t. I sent 2 reminders about it. I have a Russian last name, so it gets in many spam boxes and remind new people. My email is my last name with first letter think (Hrbecj@yahoo.com) So last week I called her and asked why no appointment. She said she sent 2, and I DIDN’T reponse. She dug around and found her letter with sensitive info and medications, and HOME address. She went and sent it to my abusive fathers’s email (Hrbec@yahoo.com)Needless to say, I am crushed and feel betrayed. I’m scared. I meet with her this week and I know it was a mistake on her part. Small apology. LIke he didn't know he beat me and made me sir on my bare knees in salk after he belt them. I don’t think she quite realizes how terrible scared I am. What should I do? Say? Does this break HIPPA or anything else. I’ve scrubbed he cant find me. It's hard to find many therapists these days--I'm scared i'll run out anti depressants and beta blockers and valium (10 per month)Advice? Lawyers? Docs?"
Am I liable for my roommate's mistake a year after moving out?,"Lived with a friend in a house we split in Missouri on a year long lease.  11 months in just before we renew, we have a falling out and she tells me to leave.  We're co-leasing so technically I should have more of a say than that but I don't particularly want to stay, so fine, I leave.  She agrees to pay for the last month on her own and I just don't sign up on the lease renewal.  I don't tell the landlord about it, but I never hear from him either so I just assume I'm not involved anymore.  Now just over a year later I'm hearing roommate is having some trouble and might be formally evicted... but landlord is claiming I'm still a legal resident and that I might be equally liable.So does that make sense if I never signed a lease from 2020-2021?  Can they just renew without your approval?  If I'm still on the lease can I escape it before any legal action is taken?"
Security guard vs skateboarder: legal standpoint please,"Hello everyone,This is not another repost just to show the video but I'm interested in the legal standpoint of this.I'm NOT looking for any ""the kid deserved it IMO"" or ""the guard should go to jail IMO"" - there is already enough of that in other posts.But it would be nice to see what the law says about this or what ramifications this would have.Video of the incidentPrivate Propertyit appears that the SG asked the kid to not do itIt appears that the kid does ignore the appeal of the SGThe SG then takes an action that resulted in an injury for the skaterAssuming that the kid sues the SG/company, what is the legal on this?Dismissed because the the kid was in a private property and that is not classified as excess use of force?I don't know what determines what is an excess use of force - it it is the action itself or the injuries caused.SG is at fault because even though the kid was in a private property, that is classified as excess use of force?"

"My health insurance company called a family member (I am an independent adult, I don’t even know how they got their number) to get me to download an app","See title.A week ago, I got a phone call at work. It was from a nurse at my health insurance company, asking me a bunch of questions relating to my mental health and asking if I’m doing all right and that they were concerned due to a recent “crisis”.I was confused as hell, since while I’m seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist for depression and anxiety, I have not expressed suicidal thoughts, hearing voices, etc. to either or them, or any of my doctors, nor have I expressed such sentiments or experiences recently elsewhere. The nurse went on to say that I could download an app for mental health support and said she’d be checking up on me in a week.I was so confused that I ended up calling my roommate immediately after I hung up, just to ask him if he’d made some bogus report on me somewhere, or something. I was really grasping at straws. Then while I was on the phone with him, I received a text message from my dad, telling me that I needed to call the insurance company.They’d called him trying to get ahold of me after I’d talked to them. I have never given my insurance company his contact number information. I never would - if I needed to provide an emergency contact, my roommate would be first, my mom second, my dad maybe fourth or fifth. They’d have to get his number from maybe one of my doctors, when I’d give him as an emergency contact there perhaps, way down the line, or, jeez, I dunno.They called again yesterday while I was at work to “check up on me”. The app, blah blah blah. I asked point-blank, precisely what is this all about? What inspired the first call in the first place? And the nurse pretty much refused to answer my question. The first call, she mentioned an unspecified “crisis”; the second, she explains “Well, we just have these resources available……” Like no I wanna know why you’re calling me. Why you called my parent.This whole thing makes me incredibly uncomfortable. The fact that they called me out of the blue for no reason, referencing a “crisis” they they won’t give me details about (and apparently didn’t happen by the time they made their second call); that they contacted a family member that I did not give them permission to contact for a non-emergency after they had already spoken to me; and the fact that they’re so evasive about their reasoning for all of this just seems wrong. Is it legal? Is it ethical? I get my insurance through work - who do I go to?"
Fraudulent Vehicle Transfer,"In Los Angeles County, CA. My friend was gifted a very lavish vehicle by someone with the title in her (my friends) name. She recently had a falling out with this person and they fraudulently transferred the vehicle to themselves and reported the vehicle stolen. It was impounded and neither party is able to recover the vehicle from the impound lot at this time. She became aware of the fraudulent title transfer prior to the vehicle being seized and was fighting it through the DMV. The car was taken and now the DMV can't help and law enforcement is being uncooperative. The situation is getting very complicated and she needs help finding an attorney that can assist her or at least advice on where to turn to next.TLDR; In California a guy gave my friend a car and then faked her signature to change the title and report it stolen. The police took it and the DMV won't help."

Child's father wants Paternity test even though he hasn't been involved in child's life,"This guy wants a paternity test for a 1 year old. He isn't on the child's birth certificate, and he's not directly coming out as the child's father. The mother doesn't want him involved in the child's life since he did not want to take responsibility and didn't want to be on the child's birth certificate. On Father's day, he contacted the mother claiming he's entitled to a paternity test. Depending on the outcome is how he plans on becoming involved or not. He wants to take it to court. Does he have a case, since he's not claiming the child to be his until proven otherwise? She's not seeking him for any assistance."

What are my options for gaining legal ownership of a house?,"I know the title sounds a bit misleading but, I'll explain. Through a bunch of super petty family politics, my grandmother left her son (my uncle) her home when she passed away. He lives on the other side of the country and visits maybe once a year, if that.  My mother and brother (daughter and grandson of the original owner) live there currently and have for about 5-6 years. They pay all the bills and taxes on the house, and it is their legal address. Additionally, my uncle has organized several upgrades to the house over the years, such as a new roof, new paint, and and updated bathroom, and my mom and brother have repaid him for all expenses.My question is this- is there anything stopping my uncle from waiting until the house has been totally renovated on my mom's and brother's dime, then kicking them out and selling the house for his own profit? He has been reluctant to discuss transferring the deed, and always changes the subject when any of us press it. I just wondered if living there for a length of time or paying the property taxes gave us any sway when it came to taking ownership, assuming he refuses to sign it over.Thanks in advance!"
Can outside sales reps be made to perform manual labor to fulfill a contract by another sales rep for no additional compensation?,"My boss wants me to come in on Sunday to set up a festival that he (acting as a sales rep) sold. I am by definition an outside sales rep paid on commission with a small base pay (Salary). I will be receiving no additional compensation for this job will be working outside of my normal working hours, and work is being performed for a customer that I don't interact with otherwise. I will be working over 40 hours in a week as a result of this. This is taking place in Illinois.I want to see if I should see a lawyer because I understand that my boss plans to do this over and over throughout the summer. Should I be recording incidents? They avoid putting things like this in writing, but should I send an email asking what hours I should be working? I'm trying to get out of this job as soon as I can find one in a field I recently earned a graduate degree in, so being fired/retaliated against is not a huge concern. I just want to burn them so badly on this (in a legal and reasonable way) that they never try to pull this again on anyone else."
"Litter of Puppies, Now Adults, Now Health Concerns","10 years ago my dog (small breed) had puppies, I kept one of the puppies from that litter and gave away (free) the remainder to then friends and family. Some of those “friends” are no longer friendly. The puppy I kept, now 10, may have a heart condition. We are awaiting the final results. Should her results be positive, I feel like the right thing to do is to reach out to each dog owners and let them know.What is the likelihood that I would be held responsible for any medical bills or other damages?"
"Porn should be legal to consume at 18, but not to MAKE until much later in your 20s.","We   know now that at 18 our brains have not fully developed the frontal   cortex to help us make sound decisions. We are malleable and easily   influenced. Lacking the support of a loving family, life-long   self-destructive decisions can be made in an instant.Usually,   men in porn are older. Much older. 30s and 40s, and even older than   that. So their decisions can't be comparable to those of the so called   ""porn stars"" (aka: lost girls) they recruit.So, with the body of knowledge we have around brain development, why are  we  still legally allowing grown men to destroy kids for a few bucks?"
How big/valuabe should a stolen item be before I bother phoning the police about it?,"Someone stole a parcel I just got.. I mean, I know when it was stolen because there's a timestamp on the camera - but it was only like a $10 headphone cable so, like, not sure if should let it slide."
"If someone were to use a firearm in a fairly ""obvious"" case of self defense, like for example shooting an armed intruder in their own home...","Should that person still refrain from describing what happened to the police when they arrive, until they have legal council?I have often heard that if you get accused of a crime, you should generally avoid saying anything to law enforcement until you have a lawyer, as you will almost certainly not be able to talk yourself out of it, and anything you divulge can and will be used against you in court.However, if you have little to no doubt that anyone reasonable would see this as an act of self defense, would waiting for a lawyer still be advisable? I am wondering if refusing to answer questions when the police show up to the scene would actually make them more suspicious of you."

My job violated my waiver? What should I do.,"I work in Indiana and I am below the age of 18. My parents had to sign a wavier saying they can hold me up until 11 pm to help close the store. The other night, the managers left me and a shift leader to close (they leave him there often usually with only 1 other person.

Could I change my name to a character name?,"I'm wondering if I could change my name to a popular character name, and use that to gain popularity.Like If I changed my name to Homer S Simpson, would there be problems with that legally? or would it cross the line IF I started using the Simpson likeness to my advantage, like starting doing 'homer simpson-esque' things on tiktok?"
"Regarding ""best by"" date codes on non-perishable food (PA-US & ONTARIO)","I work at a production plant that manufactures and packages dry Kosher cereals such as oatmeal, grits, and cream of wheat.While based in Pennsylvania, we utilize a co-packer based out of Ontario for products we don't have the means to produce on-site, such as single-serve packets. Our co-packer generally takes about 2 weeks of production to satisfy our orders.What this means for us is that we get a truckload of product with sometimes up to 10 different date codes, not in any type of coherent order, and either partial pallets of each datecode, or mixed pallets with 2 (rarely more) datecodes. This bogs down the shipping and receiving dock as we have to verify the datecodes and the quantity of each datecode. This also chokes up the warehouse as we sort and ship everything by FIFO.It would be much simpler, with less chances of someone screwing something up, if the products came to us with, say, the oldest production date as the datecode for the whole shipment.Is there any law or regulations that forbid us from marking the expiration date as all one day, where it expires up to a month sooner than normal for those products?"
Domino’s Tip Theft?,"Hi everyone, I just started a job as a cook and customer service rep for a local Domino’s in Pennsylvania. Typically, in other pizza shops I’ve worked, the credit card tips are put in and split every time someone’s shift ends. We also pool cash tips.Today was my second day and the first day, I forgot to ask for my tips. Oh well, move on. But today, I saw that there was a large amount tipped and remembered to ask how to split the tips before I clocked out. I was told by the manager that we don’t get credit card tips and can only receive cash tips. The manager said that the people who get the tips are the morning and evening managers “because they’re at fault if the till is short.”Is this legal? I’ve been trying to Google and I can’t find anything because this is pretty specific and it doesn’t apply to the delivery drivers. They get all of their credit card tips. Thanks so much in advance for the responses and sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile.UpdateOops, sorry. I didn’t post an update. I called the labor board and corporate. Corporate barely cared and just decided to tell my boss that I had called by “contacting their HR” and sending a complaint to them (the same kind if a customer comes and has a bad experience so they complain to corporate). I contacted them on the same day. My boss caught wind and 100% turned around and started to let us keep our credit card tips but I’m not 100% sure he’s splitting all of it. For starters, the manager is getting a cut which is bs because he’s salary. Also, at the end of the night, the tip pool only pays out a buck a person. I know people tip less bc we’re a chain and such, but it doesn’t sound like all we got for a night was a total of $3-4 (depending on how many people are working). The labor board called me to get my take the day after they made this change. They said since they changed, there’s nothing they could do. If I or any current or former employees wanted back payment on tips, then they would have to have an exact dollar amount down to the penny on what they missed out on. Except, the manager doesn’t teach us how to check the progression of the tips and how much we’re actually owed. So, yeah. We’re getting money, but we’re still being swindled."

Auto Shop Negligence - Arizona,"I live in Southern AZ. Took my car in to have the front right axle replaced. Had the axle replaced, $550. Car seemed fine. Drove over to San Diego. Half way discovered steering was a bit hokey and it seemed to shake a tiny tiny bit while driving, but was able to carefully get there.Took it to a local small time shop in SD and they jacked it and on the spot told me and showed me the car was completely missing a critical bolt that held the lower control arm to the wheel. They told me that I was INCREDIBLY lucky that I didn’t get into bad accident, multiple times. They even said the guy from the parts department of the dealership was incredibly surprised I made it. They also told me this bolt has a self-locking function and normally doesn’t snap off or become loose. They also told me this bolt typically needs to come off during an axle replacement.So they fixed her up for $199, including the $10 bolt they grabbed from the dealer, an hour labor, and an alignment.What legal recourse or claim can I make here? I didn’t get into an accident and was on the hook for just the additional service. I am a bit unnerved that the part was likely forgotten… and that I could’ve potentially been killed if this car flew off I-8.Thank you."

What is and isn't a booby trap?,"I ask this because I have come to the conclusion that there might be a way around booby trap laws this is more of a thought experiment than anything.Scinario 1: Say I had a camera and had it hooked up to an app on my phone, where it would give me an option to activate or trigger some sort of ""trap"". Would this be a booby trap.Scenario 2: say I took that camera and had it feed data into a neural network that would automatically trigger this trap on a single specific person.Honestly I was watching that video on public freakout of the woman just constantly ringing some guy's door bell so would there be any real legal ramifications of rigging something that would spray pepper spray or liquid ass only at the woman in the video? And trust me making a neural network or some other machine leaning algorithm to differentiate a single person from anyone else is pretty easy and very possible for some guy in his garage to do."

"Landlord rights vs. renter rights, involving a church and a preschool","I’m in Virginia, I run a preschool that rents our facility space from a church. We are our own entity, and not a part of the church, even if they tend to regard us as their mission. Recently the issue of sharing the private medical information of staff with the general public has arisen. (Yes, this is regarding staff receiving the Covid vaccine) Several of the church governing body believe that providing this information to anyone who asks is mandatory and not confidential, and have argued that families that attend or wish to attend must have this information to make an informed choice. As at this moment the state agency that we function under does not require that we share this information, it does come under the heading of confidential, and it is up to a staff member to share their personal, private information.  Given the wording of their statements I feel strongly that they will next be demanding that they know the same kind of information about the families that attend as well. So far my citing our mandate to keep confidentiality and that fact that dissemination of private medical information can open us up to lawsuits has not sunk in.The church has stated that unlessA. Every teacher is vaccinated and B. That we share this information with them/the general public we will have to change our procedures or close down.So as a landlord what are their rights over a business that is renting from them? What is overstepping those rights?"

I MIGHT OWE MY MENTOR SOME MONEY....,"Okay so this morning I woke up to a call from my mentor that was rather unpleasant. Just a backstory I am 19 years old about to turn 20 at the end of this month. I'm actively doing my best to get started in becoming a real estate investor. So I networked with many people and was able to find a mentor who was nice enough to help me get started. He asked me to drive about an hour away (Brampton, ON to Kitchener, ON, Canada) to see some of his properties (duplex conversions then BRRRR which is exactly what I am looking to do).Long story short I exchanged value for value by doing little jobs here and there, which also helped me get exposure to the work contractors are able to do. i find this appealing because when I start having to find contractors, I know how much work needs to be done and can pay them accordingly. So I did a fairly easy job (digging a hole to find the conduit that connects to the house and main powerline) and he ended up paying me (which he didn't have to but did it out of kindness and promised to pay me more once the deal started cashflowing after the renovations).So, my dad started a side hussle as a scrap metal person and because of this my mentor was willing to give us some copper pipes (copper is worth a good amount) and a full central a/c unit (also worth a good amount). So here's where it gets messed up. The day before he told me to go in the basement of one of his houses to pick up the copper pipes where these other contractors I met the day before were doing a job. They helped us cut up some of the pipes to fit in our truck and then made sure to disconnect the a/c unit so we could take it. So we took out everything and left and everything was fine for 2 weeks. Then I get a call from my mentor saying we took the WRONG a/c unit and it was the one at another property he has and we were all lost for words on what to do next.It was a miss communication because he said in Whatsapp voice note that ""the copper pipes would be in the basement of the house and the contractors will know you and your dad are coming and the a/c unit is at the back of the house and I'll send you the address so no need to knock on the door and no one should bother you but call me if you have any problems."" The issue is I thought he was talking about the first house not a different one and also he never sent me a different address (otherwise I would've realized to let my dad know we have to go to two houses).My dad is currently at work now and I told him this and of course my mentor knows that we both don't have the money to pay for it (even though I am doing my best to find a way) but he said he feels bad saying that he regrets helping someone because of the situation he is in now (the contractors and partners are all blaming me and telling him that I should be the one paying for it) . The issue is he is using someone elses money for the property and its kind've a messy situation for the both of us. My dad said he talked to a guy that may have one but hes firm on the price. I don't want my mentor to have to pay for anything but I wouldn't be able to pay for much. I'm doing my best to be optimistic but I feel terrible for messing with something this big especially after everything hes helped me with (and was willing to do more; like let me see numbers and other deal etc. - which might not be the case now). My parents are both not home yet but some points they made is"" everyone is trying to blame you indirectly"" even though my mentor wasn't too clear on his communication (didn't send an address) and I failed to realize the a/c unit was actually located at a different property."

[CA] Employer treating me unfairly with vehicle assignment. What can I do?,"My boss (Second in charge) keeps assigning me the same vehicle everyday while giving everyone else different. While I normally don't care about the vehicle I am in, the vehicle he assigns me (crown victoria) is very cramped and is hurting my leg (We have a prisoner partition in the vehicles and the way it is Setup it causes the seat to sit very forward, making me have to sit at a weird angle that causes pain to my leg. (I have tendon problem with my left knee that if im not carful, tends to get injured and ends up putting me in a leg immobilizer until it heals)When making this known to the boss, he puts me in another vehicle that is the same (we only have two crown vics that are setup the same), the rest are SUV's which are WAY more spacious and bigger). I politely asked if there was a way I could be transferred into a SUV instead. He asked why and I explained. He told me that the SUV's were more cramped (which is a lie). He then told me to go look at the other crown victoria (which is set up the same) and asked me to see if it had foot adjustment pedals.I told him that it was not a issue with the pedals but a issue with my LEFT leg, the angle I have to sit in those vehicles because of the cage, and the getting low to get inside the vehicle. He got upset and told me to bring him the vehicle board. so I did. He assigns me the crown vic he told me to look at. Instead of continuing to argue further, I just accept it and painfully take the vehicle because I feel to embarrassed to be complaining over something as silly as a car.I decided to start documenting the vehicles in which he assigns. I found that only myself and another employee whom everyone dislikes for childish reasons tends to always be assigned the same vehicle. This other co-worker has about 7+ years with the company. I've personally heard and seen employee level supervisors give him the worst vehicles in the fleet because they claim ""he smells"" (which is completely childish).Like I said, I don't care about the vehicle im in, but I am getting upset how they constantly treat both myself and this other employee differently to everyone else. I am not a bad employee. I left for 4 months, and was called to come back (did 3 years with the company prior). I'm the first one there (showing up early) and the first to leave (all my equipment is turned in and work is done and am waiting by my car while everyone else is still getting gas at the gas station for the vehicles.)Speaking to a employee level supervisor, I got his opinion on what he thought about me asking the second in charge the question. He said It wasn't going to work because I was considered ""new"" again. Except we just got a guy who got hired on after me. He's getting the SUV every night. Both myself and the other employee whom I mentioned are given the same vehicle. So the issue on ""Seniority"" is not exactly there. I personally feel I am being discriminated against and that the boss's actions are intentional and not just ""coincidental"""

Questions about squatting in a commercial property that I own,I am in the process of movimg my business to a new building and the building includes a large section for offices which i don't need for my business. My hope is that I can turn the office portion into an apartment for myself but the buildingitself is zoned as a commercial property. So my question is: what kind of consequences could i face for essentially squatting in a building that I own? And is there a simple way to do this legally?
Help with a basic legal phrase for a cancellation policy,"Hi everyone,I hope you are all doing well!I run a small start-up with my wife. We teach English and have been grown steadily from a hand full of students to close to 40 right now.  During the early stages of our development, we quickly realised we needed something to protect ourselves and teachers from last-minute cancellations.I drew up a very basic cancellation policy myself and we have been adapting it as we go along. This is by no means a professional document, but we are based in Latin America and things aren't always done so professionally here so I think it is fine for now.  We do intend to pay for professional legal support if we get considerably larger.I would like to put a sentence at the start of our policy stating that we reserve the right to withdraw it and any part or specific section of it if we feel people are taking the piss and abusing it. I am really out of my depth with this and don't really know where to go for templates or advice.Is this ok, I'm not sure ""repudiate"" is the correct term to use. How should I word it?""We reserve the right to repudiate any part of this policy, at any time and under any circumstance, if we feel it is being abused or going to be abused.""I would be forever grateful for any help or advice you can give me."

"In Scrubs S4 E23, a dying woman decides not to be put on a breathing machine after a discussion with her neighbor. Her brother finds out about this and threatens to sue the neighbor. Would this be a viable lawsuit IRL?","In the episode ""My Faith in Humanity,"" J.D. (the main character, a physician) tells an elderly woman that her lungs are failing and she has two options: 1) be put on ""a breathing machine"" (but he explains ""but it's unlikely you'd ever come off of it"") or 2) ""I could just try to make you as comfortable as possible.""  He asks if there is anyone she would like to talk to before making her decision.  She asks to speak to her neighbor and then decides not to be put on the breathing machine.Her brother then finds out and says to the neighbor, ""You just talked my sister into ending her life... I'm suing you.""Would this actually be a viable lawsuit?  I can see where a doctor telling someone there's no hope when there actually is could be malpractice.  But I would have thought a conversation between friends wouldn't have been enough to argue that the friend caused the death of the person refusing care."

my original tenant is trying to evict us but did not go thru the court?,"ok long post but i really need some legal help in this situation 😕 we live in a sublease agreement that may/may not even be legal in Georgia. we have established residency and been here for almost a year, and have been living thru a verbal agreement, which she has broken constantly. bc of that we told her we wanted a written agreement and would only sign it if a sheriff came down and mediated our conversation so there were no misconceptions ab the law or our rights, something she agreed to. she later then texted us a pdf of a random sublease agreement and told us to have it signed by a certain day if we wished to continue staying there, which violated our verbal agreement of staying thru August regardless of the lease, which is still unsigned. i told her she needed to provide me a printed copy bc im conventional that way, unless she could provide a secure portal in which i could e-sign this lease. never once did i say i wouldn’t sign it, but she was rude and told me to print it out myself???? for months our original tenant has been very shady on the rent and bills. i address them with her respectfully, telling her that i can’t just send her $ without knowing how much i’m actually paying and she told me she wanted a lump sum every month but that would not account for the fluctuation in bill amounts- so she would just pocket that extra money (she has no job and hasn’t had one for the entire time we’ve lived here) against our wishes and rights as tenants and the verbal agreement we had. she is immediately hostile with me and my other roommate whenever we bring up the rent and our issues with it, which is shady in itself. this month we both agreed to not pay this “cleaning fee” that she’s been imposing on us because we noticed that no cleaning service came so it was really just us paying her to clean the things she makes dirty considering i never use the common areas and my other roommate is rarely at the house. after detailing that we would no longer pay that fee she said that it wasn’t even for a cleaning fee anymore and was something else entirely (the same exact amount??? that’s suspicious!) but she had not given us notice for that or discussed it with us at all so we don’t owe her that money. after verbally harassing me while illegally occupying my rented space without my consent and while i continually told her to exit, she texted my roommate and I eviction notices and slid them underneath our doors for failure to pay rent and for breaking the lease and had to leave in 30 days. is any of this right??? i paid her the full amount of rent and utilities that had already been discussed and agreed upon sans the cleaning fee so that’s a nonfactor and we never signed the lease because it was never provided in an appropriate fashion then negotiated like leases are supposed to be. she also said if we attempted to contact the owners she would evict us, and the day after i called the owners because THEY wished to speak with ME we get these notices, which seems like a retaliatory eviction to me. she hasn’t filed anything thru the court and she has been witnessed throwing away my personal belongings, which she seems to think is ok bc she “gave notice” for me to move my belongings out of a room that has been reserved for my roommate who told me it was fine to have my things there until she moved her stuff down into that room to gain distance between her and this girl. I know this is a bit of a word vomit but i’m happy to give more information if anyone could help me in this situation??"

Creating and selling prints of other people's distorted art or images?,"I'm curious if I sourced a bunch of images from Pintrest, Instagram, etc. and digitally altered them (changed the colours, superimposed other images on them, cropped parts of them, etc.) to create a separate piece of artwork, then sold that in a print... is this legal?  The final image is nothing similar to the original, but may have a portion of the original used to create the work.  I enjoy geometric shapes, so I often find a picture of a landscape I like, and use several apps to create a digitized surreal version where I superimpose textures, patterns and other graphic elements to create an image I post on my own Instagram. If I know who created the original, I may reach out in a DM asking if I can use  of of their images. Usually they look at my work and comply, but often I don't always have the knowledge or contact of the original image found online.I'm thinking of printing some of the images I've created (I've had a lot of demand) and selling them framed. I may print them on a hard surface and add additional painted elements, mixed media, or fiber art to the pieces to give them more dimension. Before attempting this, I want to avoid a lawsuit."

Is a self-exculpatory clause in an adhesive contract enforceable?,"I have a complaint against a stock broker.I had a bull put spread on IWM and a stop loss order to liquidate it if the stock hit my short strike.

I'm still pressuring them for an explanation.In the mean time, I was reading through their adhesive Account Agreement, and came across this gem:""We will not be liable for lost profits, trading losses or other damages resulting from the delay or loss of use of the services. In any case, our liability arising from any legal claim (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) relating to the services will not exceed the amount you have paid for use of the services.""Is such a self-exculpatory clause in an adhesive contract enforceable?

About the suppression of evidence...,"If a cop were to obtain some information through a crime, say trespassing for example, he knows he can't use it in court himself, so he hands that info to his buddy in the FBI ""anonymously."" when you go into court to argue about the whole thing, and you find out that the FBI agent got the info from his buddy who got it from something he's not allowed to be doing, that information can be suppressed, right?To bring it to a more concrete example, Missouri recently passed, and is waiting for the governor's signature, the Second Amendment Preservation Act (SAPA) which makes it a fineable action for any public officer or employee of the State or it's political subdivisions from enforcing any past, present, or future ""acts, laws, executive orders, administrative orders, court orders, rules, regulations, statutes, or ordinances"" that infringe on the right to keep and bear arms. and they specifically point out that taxing a right is as unconstitutional for the 2A as it is for the right to vote, and that this SAPA explicitly calls out the 1934 National Firearms Act, the GCA of 1968, Trump's Bump-stock ban, Federal ""Red Flag"" laws, and any other scheme implemented by the feds.

"Chase messed up my flight, stranding me in Miami and costing me hundreds and a day of work","So I booked a flight using my chase reward points.

Before I got off the phone with her I had her read me the inbound and outbound information and confirmed it was correct, an 8 am outbound from PHI and a 5 pm inbound from MIA. So I wake up today to check into my flight and surprise surprise, my flight was at 8 am. They changed both even though they told me otherwise.So I called them (it took 2 hours) and was basically told that the ball is in the airlines court and that there was nothing they could do. I called the airline and am currently expecting to be called back in 3 hours. Ivd already called out of work tomorrow and will be telling my hotel I need another night shortly.I'm curious if I have any legal recourse to sue for the money that staying in Miami another night costed me. Hotel, dogsitter, and food for tonight plus the day of work I missed. And I know the conversation are recorded so they would have to show that and that would be proof that they didnt tell me the right information. The info was in the flight itinerary so that might screw me, but I didnt check it because of what I was told.So any chance?

Mandating extra work?,"I work at a big company and I started 2 years ago. Here recently we've been starting to work weekends and it became mandated.

My boss says he doesn't legally have to give me a break but, I don't think that's true. I'm just tired of working my weekends and I have no life anymore. All I do anymore is just work and sleep. Is this legal and what can I do to stop working so much  since he (my manager) says I have to work by company need. What's worse is when I do show up on the weekend I'm the only one that shows up from my group and he never punishes them. But the one time I didn't show up I had a valid reason since I was in the hospital. I even had a doctor's note but he said it was unacceptable. He said if I didn't show up this weekend I would get a letter. A letter at this place means if you get three of them you get terminated. But the thing, is those who don't show up don't get reprimanded in any way, he never even brings it up. I'm from Indiana and this is at a shipping company. Ever since a certain instant happened people keep quitting like wildfire. That and the way they treat us is just awful so nobody wants to stay. They might pay us well but the treatment is bad. I tried bringing it up to my manager yesterday about how I can't keep working weekends and he said I was preaching to the choir. What are my options I can't just quit It's the only better paying job out there right now. I'm afraid if I don't show up he will actually fire me since he doesn't like me.

Question about fees & online accounts + prisoners,"Hello AskLegal - I have a family member in a county prison.  She has already pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing.  She's been there for 2 years now.  They keep pushing out her sentencing because they want her as a witness in her co-defendant case and sentencing will put her in either TX or MN. (This is frustrating in and of itself. County prison doesn't give her access to GED materials or rehab for her physical issues. )Sadly, I'm not a stranger to the prison system- My father was incarcerated for years when I was younger.  I know that I can reduce the risk of her recidivism by having a relationship with her and encouraging others close to keep their relationships active with her  as well. As you probably know, this will be difficult with her going to another state.The county jail she is in uses a third party for communications (InmateCanteen). I've been ranting about them for a while to my friends - They charge $8.95 service fee- whether you add $10 or $100.  I think it is predatory on low income families, which I know represent a disproportionate # of prisoners. My waitress sister likely uses her tip money to communicate w/ her daughter and has small amts to deposit.Now I see that they charge a monthly fee to keep the money in the account.  Their terms of service do not spell out their fees, and it actually says that they have the right to change them without notice.  So they are going to get the money they want out of me one way or another.So I have two questions.  First, can they do that?  Keep money without explaining fees or giving you notice of changing fees? Just because it is in their ToS does that make it okay?Second, where do I start writing/calling if I want to reach out to gov't about this system?  Is it my congressman?  The congressman of MO (ugh - Left there for PNW for a reason!)tl;dr I find the fees charged to speak to inmates unreasonable and not explained in their ToS. I would like to affect change."

Can i get someone (or anyone) to pay for damages they incurred if they don't have insurance?,"I bought a building earlier this year with the intention of moving my business into it once certain repairs were completed. These repairs included having the outer brick walls redone as it had fallen into disrepair over the past decade of being vacant. Because the brick issues were a safety concern, the only insurance any company would sell me right away was liability insurance to cover any workers that were working on getting the building up to code. I would have had it fully insured if anyone would have offered it.A little over two weeks ago, someone ran a stop sign (my bulding is on the corner opposite), was hit by another car, and wound up crashing through the front of my building. Once i got a copy of the police report i learned that the driver who was responsible for the accident didn't even have a driver's license, let alone insurance for the car. So my insurance told me that this isn't their problem due to only having liability insurance and his doesn't exist.My insurance company told me to take him to small claims court but between the work that was already scheduled to be done and the new repairs that are now needed I really can't afford a lawer right now. I'm also very skeptical that this guy has much money. (I'm basing that off police/court records i was able to look up on him) so I'm not sure if there's any point.Also, i have had some of the new damage looked at by people who can fix it but at the moment i am not fully sure of how much his car accident caused. Should I wait to file a lawsuit until i have that information? Should I just accept that I'm going to pay for this and there isn't much I can do?What are the reasons are to go to court or not go to court for this? I dont want to pay a lawer or have to take time off of work to go to a court hearing, but it's a hard pill to swallow to just accept that you are financially responsible for someone else's mistake and it's going to cost more than you can handle at the moment.

Questions about minimum wage,"I’m running a business painting homes this summer and while I’m going to be paying more than minimum wage, I’m just curious about how it works. So most of my jobs would be in a certain county, but a few might be in a different county/city where minimum wage is different. Since it’s an on site job my painters would be working in that other county where minimum wage would be higher. Would I then need to pay them a higher wage specifically for those jobs in the county where minimum wage is higher even if that’s different than their normal wage?"

Recording home showings/ mask mandate,"Overall question, is it legal to video record in my own home during house showings? We live in PA.We listed our house for sale looking to move to better schools and closer to better doctors as my child has health issues. I have a few cameras setup around the house and decided to have them record, mostly to see what odd places we need to wipe down as we're overly paranoid. Even though masks were provided at the door, and we asked both in the listing and on a sign when you walk in to please wear a mask, I caught on video a group of 4 people plus the realtor not wearing a mask at all. Not just wearing it inappropriately, zero mask. I'm IRATE. I want to go after the realtor, but I also am concerned of the implications of opening that box. Any input/ suggestions would be appreciated."

[Copyright Law] Is It Illegal To Record Livestreams?,"Hello friends,I've recently found myself getting into the hobby of collecting information on the internet. Mostly interesting articles about specific locations or bizzare videos from youtube.I don't share the stuff I collect with other people, I pretty much just archive it and then never look at it again. Strange, I know.Recently I've found the twitch community interesting, and want to record livestreams reflecting things I think will be important turning points in the company's history.Would recording prominent streamers' thoughts on rule changes, etc be considered illegal, even if I don't redistribute the videos? Furthermore, what sort of collecting is constituted as illegal online? Youtube videos? Livestreams? Articles?I enjoy the hobby of archiving interesting things, but I don't want to do it if I could find myself in legal trouble for it."

How is consumer financial data ownership decided?,"I have been trying to understand this better partially as a motive of principle but also of practicality as I think it is a good thing for people to know. I tried skimming through the GDPR full text (https://gdpr-info.eu/) but it doesn't really lay out who should own what kind of data in what situation outside of people owning ""Personally Identifiable Information"" - but I think this gets a little fuzzy in the situation of financial transactions between partiesHere are some interesting examples that I was hoping to get some knowledgable folks to help me understand better:The transactions that I submit through my bank (for ex. when I buy a t-shirt.)  Is each transaction object  completely technically owned by me or the bank? is it both?What about the payments to utility companies or telecoms? Are these transactions owned by me?Credit card payments?  My credit card number?  Missed credit card payments?Transactions between myself and my landlord for rent/mortgage?"

Former co-founder wants me to remove any mention of my involvement in the company. Am I required to do so?,"We worked on building an app together until December of last year (2020) when he fired me.

I thought that was the end of it until ...He recently sent me a Cease & Desist notice and filed a complaint with LinkedIn demanding that I remove my involvement with the company. Saying that I wasn't CTO and I didn't cofound the company with him and I'm lying about my involvement.

"Downstairs neighbour spit on my door, banging etc.","I live on the second floor of a condo. The new downstairs neighbour complains constantly about me and my partner walking around because the floors can be squeaky. He complains most during the afternoon when he is trying to sleep.When we walk he will bang on his ceiling as loud as he can. We had a brief conversation about this where I say I can’t control if the floors squeak when we walk on them. I weigh 140 after thanksgiving and deliberately walk quietly. Today after grabbing clothes in the bedroom the neighbour came upstairs and I heard him spit on the door. The door is still wet.How do I deal with this? The building association isn’t doing much and he’s incredibly confrontation so it doesn’t seem this can be resolved through words. I’m in Ontario, Canada"
Leasing office claiming rent not paid..while it was cashed in their posession.,"I would like some clarity on a situation my   sister just informed me is she is experiencing with the leasing office  of her apartment complex in georgia.On may 4th she placed a money order for her rent in the deposit box. She then texted them so they can confirm receipt of the money order, they confirmed receipt of it on March 4th at 2pm. On march 8th she received a late payment notice stating that they have not received payment from her, she texted them inquiring about it  and they said that they received it but they havent integrated it into the system, but they assured her that they have on file that they received it on time so just disregard the email.

She then dropped off a next money order on april 2nd and they confirmed receipt on april 2nd.  She receives an email from the leasing office on april 12th stating that the money order from march was  not able to be cashed. The leasing office told her in an email  that when they spoke to western union, western union tracked it and said that it was cashed on the 8th of march(they confirmed receipt on 4th of march) but the leasing office would have to open an inquiry and pay to see who cashed the money order.they have opened the inquiry and are waiting to hear what western union says.they told her that there were no issues with the April payment as it had been deposited already.

A week later she gets another email saying that there was an issue with the April payment as well and she now owes them nearly 2k in rent and she would have to have it paid off or she will probably face eviction.

She has all her receipts for her money orders and also their confirmation receiving the money order in writing. I'm assuming the leasing office would have to open a case on the april money order as well....so I'll wait to hear what they say on that  .I told her to have all her documentation and she'll need to either speak to the police or a lawyer.

Can they evict her for a money order that was cashed while it was in their posession?

Sidenote: she's been paying them consistently with this method for the last 2 years with no issues but there are now new staff in the office and this is now happening."

[AZ] Being sued for being on same insurance policy as someone who passed away in car accident,"A person on my insurance policy caused a multiple car accident, killing themselves as well as the other people in the accident. It appears they were driving under the influence.

I was just informed by my insurance company that my policy payout is now maxed out, and the victims familys' are going to be suing me.

Is this actually possible? Am I liable for the mistakes of another person, simply because we shared the same auto insurance policy? I am not related to this person, or married to them, we were just close friends and sharing the same policy. I am being told that I may have to pay for this as well as having my insurance rates increase."

Getting discord to delete my data,"My discord account got hacked, discord refused to recover it (their idea of recovery is basically just if you forget your password. Once the email gets changed, they say they 'can't do anything about it').

I have my real documents tied to that account (I was a verified developer, so my passport is connected to that account). I made multiple attempts over the last 2 months to get the data deleted, but they refused (or never replied at all, only got automated replies).

I'm in Czech Republic. My goal is to either gain access back to the account (it's a 5 year old account with a bot in few hundred servers), or get my personal data deleted from that account (because I believe that if the new 'owner' of the account did anything illegal, the first thing discord would do is report me to the authorities as I have my documents there).

Proving clear and present danger without being allowed to record,"Someone described a problem with gun violence threats at home.

I found out that Illinois has a red flag law where you can petition the police to take away the firearm of a family member if you can prove they are a clear and present danger to yourself or others. To me, this seems straightforward: record them next time they pull out the gun and point it at someone.

However, Illinois also has some of the most punitive recording consent laws in the country to the point of a child getting charged with a felony for recording his interaction with the principal while in the principals office.

So I'm just obsessively curious right now...

How on earth is someone supposed to prove a clear and present danger with gun threats is occurring in the privacy of the home if its a greater legal offense to record someone without their consent while they're threatening you with a gun??

Or is that the point? You aren't allowed prove it and the law protects abusers? I'm confused, annoyed, and don't understand. 😓"
Does this cause copyright problems,"So in a story I'm writing, the characters have powers similar to those of the characters from the animorphs series.

Can this apartment issue escalate?,"Can this issue escalate?

I moved to this apartment complex in California and took on this lease mostly for its attractive amenities such as the pool, weight room, conference rooms, pet washing station, game room, lounges, cafe deli, etc.

I’ve been here for 4 months now and I’m already very dissatisfied because all the amenities are closed due to covid. I understand these things must be shut down because of covid but some things aren’t even built yet but on their website it says they have it.

Community wifi was listed but it’s not even set up (not even covid related) they said they have a cafe and deli but I see none??

The weight room and poop recently opened but it’s reservation only. The game room isn’t even built, the lounges are closed, conference rooms are closed, my dog hasn’t had a bath since we moved here because I was and still do expect to use the pet wash station.

I pay a little over $1700 for a studio... and to have 0 access to use my amenities. I feel like there should be a rent adjustment because of covid, but they just shut down amenities and made everyone pay the same during the pandemic.

I feel like I’ve been deceived and mislead. I’ve talked to other tenants here and they fee the same but many are trapped in their lease like I am.

Is there a way to find old arrest records and domestic law cases from 1966 - 1968 without knowing the city or county within a state? [Wisconsin],"Is it possible to get legal history (arrest records, domestic case records, criminal records) on someone that dates from the 1960's without knowing a specific city/county?

I'm trying to establish someone's history in Wisconsin in the 1960's and background searches of court judgments and legal actions only appear to go back into the 1990's. Not having background searches also means, among other things, that I also can't find the city or county in WI as residential records don't go back that far. I think that if I can find the city/county within the state, that I could go to the clerk of the local courts for the case files, but can't do much without the city/county information. So court records are out. Are there arrest records that are searchable at the state level that go back as far as the 1960's?"
[CO] Dealership says I owe them an extra 3k or they'll sue. What are the chances they actually sue?,"There was a huge miscommunication between me and the dealership on my trade in over the correct payoff amount. The story is really long but short version their lawyers sent me a letter saying I owe them an extra $3k. Seems to me it would cost them more than $3k to sue me.

I'm not as interested in knowing whether or not I can fight their claims as much as whether they would actually follow suit."
