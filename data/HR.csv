"[INDIA] Is conveyance allowance included in special allowances? If not, can I ask for it? I'm a fresher any info could help. It's confusing on the internet üòÖ",
[JO] Why do I keep get rejected?,"I'm applying at hotels (famous hotel chains) as Front Office agent but I get rejected every time and I don't know the reason.I speak four languages, I know how to deal with guests, I know how to work with Opera and Fidelio, though I'm still finishing university. What could be the reason and how can I fix it?"
[UK] Holiday entitlement Work advise,"Hi all, I'm unsure if anybody is able to help but would appreciate your input.I am currently employed by a company in the manufacturing industry (coming up to 1 year and 6 months currently) and a recent update to the company handbook states, ""upon 5 years‚Äô service the employee will receive an additional 2 days holiday entitlement"", which is all and well.However, I have been employed by the same company previously for a period of 2 years and 1 month which ended when I was made redundant during covid, this was no fault of the company but purely down to the niche market supplied.The period in between the previous and current employment period is 9 months.Now after the release of the handbook update, I questioned HR whether my prior service would be considered.The response I received was my previous employment will not count due to leaving and breaking ‚Äúcontinuous service‚Äù.Which I find quite unfair, do I have any sort of leg to stand on to fight this or will it be a waste of my time?"
[India]Job Abandonment,"I got job abandonment letter 4 days ago, my HR contacted me saying they tried to reach me but I din't pick up their call, but only yesterday I received the call and talked with them. Now due to this they locked me out of my account and sent mail that I need to report to work, but the project I was assigned to do WFH and so I am out of state. So I told them to please unlock mt account so I can address to the mail, but they have not yet replied to my mail.So what should I do here?I don't have the intention to resign but if they ask me to sign 1-year bond then I am happy to resign but would it then show in my resignation letter the Job Abandonment issue?"
[WA] Is putting the job title you want in your LinkedIn headline cringe?,"Hello! I want to move away from my current title and pursue a different title.Is it cringe to put the title I want in my headline? e.g. Job Title (that I don't have yet) | Skills. I don't want to put something like ""pursuing XXX"" and tip my current job off too much. I have a brief mention of my long term goal in my About section.I'm also revising my work experience and skills to showcase experience that supports my desired title. TIA!"
[IN] How do I file FMLA while keeping the job that I love?,"Long story short, I was mauled by a dog back in November 2021. I've dealt with a lot of that internally. I have taken time off work, right after it happened I took like a week off. But the thing is I am not better. I have tried so hard to just be normal and I can't do it. I struggle every day with just existing after it happened, but honestly my job is one of the only things I care about. I'm so good at my job. I take a lot of pride in that. But now it's come to the point where I fight with depressive thoughts daily. I went to like 2 therapy appointments over the last 13ish months, I just thought I could fix it. But I can't fix it.Is there a way to claim FMLA without current medical records? It's been quite a while since I went to a doctor/therapist, but I can't fix this. And honestly just going to work and logging in would be enough to keep those issues at bay, but I can't do it anymore. I need help but also don't want to lose my only source of income.I dunno if this is the right place to post this, so yeah sorry if it's not."
Orientation [OK],I was offered a job and underwent background/drug testing. Got everything back clean‚Ä¶just had to verify a previous employer with HR since that employer was non-responsive during the BGC. My start date is Dec 5th and I haven‚Äôt been given any information about orientation as to when and where it will be‚Ä¶not sure if I should reach out and ask or just wait until after thanksgiving.Other jobs I‚Äôve had in the best had given me orientation information soon after the offer was presented to me.
[MT] An old boss of mine slapped my gf's butt recently and uses slurs in front of employees and his business partner does nothing.,"I worked at this place for 3 years before I quit because of stuff like this and that was about 3 years ago now. So in some capacity or another, for the last 6 years, I have been personally experiencing as well as hearing about this pile for too long. Whether it's my girlfriend (who is African-American, this will be important), myself, my friends I'm tired of hearing about this guy continuing this.To the point.He does this ""good game"" thing where he slaps your butt and says, ""good game"" like you would in baseball. Red flag from the get go. In the time I worked there he'd do it to the male employees and no one really cared or at least said they did, nothing like this at least. Sadly, this happened to her the other week and of course when she tried saying something she was made to believe that it was her fault, that ""his generation was different"", all the same excuses these cowards make. He tried telling her as well that it was only the back of his hand anyways. This has been making me sick since it happened, barely really slept because I'm so angry at night and the one other co-onwer does nothing. The owner even told my gf not to say anything to me about what they talked about. Can't imagine why he wouldn't want this out.Besides testimonies of past and present employees and like so many other cases today, there's no true hard evidence and sadly this is a two-party state in regard to recording.He's used the N-word in front of employees, called myself and other employees ""re***ds"" when he's upset with them, as well as, ""I'm not saying it because he's black but..."". This was in regard to when an African-American customer couldn't make a payment for several months due to factors beyond the man's control. We couldn't get ahold of the guy or run the card that he gave us so naturally why not blurt out racist rhetoric to your employees when you get upset? Seems TOTALLY acceptable in the workplace. Another oldie but goodie that he loves is, ""I grew up with black friends so I can't be racist, I'm the least racist person I know.""When I first started there I even agreed to work overtime hours without overtime pay because I was struggling so much at the time and needed every penny I could get. It was dumb I know, but I've been since informed that it's illegal even if you agree to it. He would also tell employees not to discuss their wages with each other which is right protected by law. This clown has even told me that HE is the HR department. Judge, jury and executioner, how convenient for him.I promise these things are all true and not some exaggerations, this recent incident is one of many various things he does and it breaks my heart hearing my gf blaming herself for him touching her. I've hated this garbage person since before I quit that place but I feel like there must be some legal avenue to let the local community know about a business owner who repeatedly and wantonly acts the way he does."
[NE] My boss keeps asking me what I‚Äôm sick with,"I told my boss I was sick and then a couple days later I updated him I‚Äôm still sick and still can‚Äôt come in to work. He asked what I have and I just ignored him. Then a couple days later I gave him my 3rd doctors note and said I can‚Äôt come in and he said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôre your symptoms? have you been taking any medication for it?‚Äù He‚Äôs always really upset when I‚Äôm sick saying ‚Äúwe really need you to come in we‚Äôre really short staffed‚Äù. Mind you, I work with kids. I‚Äôm not going in until I‚Äôm 100% better because I don‚Äôt want to get them sick."
[NY] HR randomly put a 30 minute meeting on my calendar to check in. What could it be?,"Got an email from my departments HR representative for a meeting tomorrow. They want to check in and see how I‚Äôm doing (1.5 years in the company/role). There was turnover in the department including some leadership. I have had no negative feedback or indication of performance issues. Given the market, not sure if it‚Äôs something to worry about."
[NY] How Can I Leverage This into a Severance Package? Can anyone show examples in writing?,"Hi all,Long story short, I'm a black director working under a middle eastern executive in a large nonprofit. I have experienced an outrageous amount of disrespect from white people of all salaries and titles while working at this company but after speaking with my boss about it (the first time) he tried telling me ‚ÄúSometimes they do it to me"" to make me feel like the disrespect and micro-aggression I was getting was okay. His advice the second and third times was to keep my distance and try to stay professional. I thought was weird advice given the nonprofit being all about diversity in their office d√©cor and on their website, but I just kept on pushing through because it‚Äôs a six-figure job and I‚Äôm not above taking money from racists. However, given my past experiences with racism, I knew to keep documenting and saving emails.Here comes the funny part, last month my boss tried to make me drive 50 miles out of the way just to meet him in a random office, and when I told him I couldn‚Äôt do it he threatened me with HR but had them contact me to ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù.I thought it was a coincidence, but they told me that they were hearing from my colleagues that I was feeling burned out. I knew it was my boss going to them because he literally told me not to talk to anyone. The kicker is that I work in compliance, and his reasoning for telling me to avoid venting or discussing workplace issues with anyone from work is he would hate for me to substantiate anything false that I hear from other employees (aka racism that I hear from other employees would probably be believed quicker if they are heard by a black compliance director than the complainants' direct supervisor, and he can‚Äôt have any of his white VP buddies getting caught up)This random HR check-in was weird because I never had a negative remark or any complaints made about me. Anyway, when the day of the 1on1 meeting comes up I bring in my 60+ emails including positive ones that show me going hard to get shit done and receiving compliments from my boss and many others. I explain to them everything and all that I‚Äôve seen they seem shocked but take all these notes and tell me they must do an investigation.So today after about a week they tell me the investigation is pretty much still going but they‚Äôd like to do peer mediation where there is a sit-down with me and my boss. I thought this was weird because they didn‚Äôt give me anything in writing. It was weird but I let them talk and they set us up to meet on December 1st.My nonprofit is large so there are a few offices throughout NY so I‚Äôm guessing my boss will avoid me until then. In the meantime, to prep for the big sit-down, I have copied the pages of the employee handbook regarding the complaint process and code of conduct. I don‚Äôt plan on getting rowdy or anything I just want to continue laying out facts and calling out inconsistencies like I‚Äôve been doing.So now I want to try to negotiate a severance. I want to make them feel like it‚Äôs easier to give me a severance of 3 months and have me sign something than have me go through with a lawsuit.I‚Äôd like to let them know that I‚Äôll continue working and documenting but would much rather part ways amicably with me receiving a severance rather than drag out a lawsuit process."
[OR] Advice about HR response about confrontation with manager,"For some background, I work in a hotel doing room service and we are implementing a lot of changes. We used to use carts to deliver food orders, equipped with a hot box for hot entr√©es, however we just changed executive directors and they want to remove the hit boxes completely. That works for small, single orders however sometimes I get hit with upwards of a half dozen orders all at once and taking my cart to deliver several at a time is much quicker and easier, especially if orders are in rooms on the same floor or right next to each other.So yesterday, I received four orders in the span of ten minutes or so, three of which were right door next to each other so I decided taking my cart would make far more sense than running back and forth four times(for perspective it‚Äôs about a quarter mile from kitchen to rooms each way, it‚Äôs not a tiny property per se). As I‚Äôm getting drinks at the bar, I asked the bartender to grab a couple for me if she had time, one of which being a Diet Coke. All of a sudden, my manager comes storming behind the bar with the glass of Diet Coke saying how that particular glassware isn‚Äôt being used anymore since it‚Äôs too top heavy for tray use(this is true, I‚Äôve spilled so many drinks using that glass it‚Äôs insane). As she‚Äôs getting ready to pour a whole new one, I try explaining that since I‚Äôm taking so many orders at once, I‚Äôm using my cart and that it will be fine in that glass since it‚Äôll be wrapped anyways, no need to use up another glass. She then flips a switch and just goes off on me saying how we aren‚Äôt using carts anymore, I need to do as I‚Äôm told, just a slew of things in the most condescending and rude way possible. It‚Äôs important to also note that while she is loudly berating and yelling at me, there is a hotel guest sitting at the bar top waiting for her breakfast order.Once my manager finishes yelling at me and storms off, the guest goes ‚Äúshe sounds fun.‚Äù  I explain that that‚Äôs just how things are and is what it is, but the guest is incredibly sympathetic and apologetic at how I was treated and remarks ‚Äúno one should talk to anyone like that ever.‚Äù She also mentions how she will be bringing it up to someone.Since a guest was technically involved, I emailed various members of management to let them know of the situation and to protect myself with a paper trail of it all, HR included. However this morning I received a response from HR that left me feeling a little defeated and frustrated. They let me know she was in the wrong for her actions in front of the guest, but basically told me that if I just didn‚Äôt ‚Äútalk back‚Äù, none of this would have happened. It makes me feel the blame is being pushed on to me, and that management isn‚Äôt responsible for any of it.Am I wrong for feeling that way? Was I in the wrong? I feel like this is a case of victim blaming, but maybe it‚Äôs not? Just not sure where to go from here and I‚Äôm hoping this is a good sub to ask for advice on how to move forward.I also want to note that this manager and I don‚Äôt get along very well, however it‚Äôs been made clear by other staff members that she explicitly treats me differently and singles me out for issues/bullying. This is not an isolated incident."
[NM] Can an employer not pay approved PTO?,"I work for one of the worlds largest corporations, my most recent pay check will be shorted 32 hours because after timesheets we‚Äôre submitted and approved my leadership told me I did not have the vacation time despite the time being approved for several months by different managers as management has changed a lot. Since I was informed of this after the time was taken off will be shorted 32 hours. What recourse if any do I have? I live in New Mexico."
[TX] Am I allowed to report racial issues on someone's behalf?,"Hello all thank you in advance for hearing me out. At my office we have a Teams thread to discuss work stuff and lately there's been a lot of racial jokes. Specifically an inside joke between our boss and a girl of Japanese descent. My boss keeps jokingly calling her Korean. It happens so randomly sometimes and it is completely uncalled for in my opinion. I'm not sure if this girl is offended or not because she kind of goes along with it. I guess my question is, is that something I'm allowed to report? I'm not Korean or Japanese myself, but I am a person of color and it makes me very uncomfortable. Does this count as hostility in the workplace"
"[CA] My hours at work greatly fluctuate. Most days I work 7 hours, but I was initially scheduled for 9. What do I put on the schedule for PTO?","Thanksgiving is a paid holiday, and my shortened hours were part of an unofficial but temporary shift. Do I get 7 hours of pay for thanksgiving? Or 9?"
[GA] Quarterly goals as a new employee,"Started as an idividual contributor pricing manager 1 week ago. CFO (my boss) is requesting quarterly goals from all managers with conditions for bonus payout. haven't been given any expectations or targets yet. I don't want it to be a Learn Learn Learn Learn Learn type thing. That feels likea cop-out. But at the same time I have no idea what's going on yet. It's only been 1 week. I have one direct report.I'm an analytical guy and both am bad at this sort of thing, and will overthink it. I have six possible lines to fill, please give your ideas.

[AL] Suspended without Date of Return,"Laid off from work (advice needed)So I have worked for this company for 4 years. Two for one temp agency about 6 months at the other and 1 and 1/5 years hired on with the company. I work in assembly and production but after a few months got moved to an offline job still there basically training team members on new processes.My record has been clean. I have never been late. Never have had and disputes or reports to HR and I have strived myself to move up within my company.So last week me and a team member got into a dispute. Now this team member has gotten away with nearly everything. Being late , missing processes , eating on the production line, leaving his spot , being on his phone while on the line.We argued and he and his buddy reported it to HR. I talked to them and his Group leader and sorted it out. I stepped away and just minded my own business to keep things calm. Well later on while I‚Äôm working on a process he is right next to me and telling that same buddy of his that -‚Äú if he starts anymore shit I‚Äôm Gonna go hunting at his house ‚Äú So I took that as a threat to me because there was no one else he had gotten into a confrontation with other than me.So I report it to HR and they take names and details from me about him. About his behavior out on the line. However , the only witness to the threat was him and his buddy so the threat may not even be taken seriously."
[PA] Should I tell my VP that I'm not getting support from my Director?,"Hey guys, I'm torn and would appreciate your perspective. I just started at a new company 5 weeks ago as one of their account managers. This company is new-ish and likes to tout that they are a small start-up but that's bull at this point. They've been around for about a decade now. Within the past year or two, this company has grown from less than hundred to almost 300 now.Anyways, my director has been absent from the start, but to say that she's completely absent is also false. Week 1 (onboarding) was in-person at the office. She flew into town for a few days, during which she made no effort to set-up 1:1 time to meet/get to know me. I was surprised so I texted her to meet in-person to go over the ""lay of the land"" of my role and responsibilities before she flew out. Of course she responded delightfully and we met. However, when we met, she derailed. She had me shadow a client call then spent the rest of our meeting talking trash about the client. With 10 minutes left of our scheduled meeting, I tried to boil down topics to, ""what should I expect"", then got the answer of, ""don't worry, it'll come. I'll get on your calendar next week to go over everything."" This conversation occurred Thursday morning.So by midday Friday, nothing is on my calendar. I message her, she gets 15 minutes on my calendar as  a ""quick catch up"" on Monday.Monday rolls by, she's MIA. Completely misses our meeting. I texted her asking if we had rescheduled or if our ""quick catch up"" had been canceled. She apologized and said she was at her kids Halloween event, totally forgot, and will call me asap. She calls me from her car, as she's driving. I'm like, okay... we don't have to talk right now. You're clearly busy.... DRIVING. She insisted that she was fine and stated she didn't have time later. She said she'd get some more training on my calendar but nothing came.In the days coming, she was consistently late or had to leave meetings early. She would either (1) ignore my Slack messages, (2) respond HOURS/DAYS later, (3) provide a response that didn't answer the question, or (4) respond but no follow through with action items.To this day, we still have not level-set on goals. There is lack of clear expectations. When I do ask, I don't get a timely response (lucky if I even get a response).Here's the BS part. She doesn't response to my personal Slack messages, but in group Slack messages, she's have a ball over there with responses and emojis.Everyone else at the company is great. My director sucks. She keeps saying how busy she is. I'm made to feel like a burden. I just started. I have been leaning on others for help, guidance and support.Coincidentally, my VP just recently got on my calendar for a ""catch up"" session later this week.Should I tell her? What should I do?"
[CAN] What kinds of background (OSINT) checks for social media/phone numbers do corporate/tech HR hiring departments conduct?,"I was hired earlier this year by a multinational corporate tech company without any reference or background check. This practice, I am certain, is not a common occurance. I was hired in an offshoot division of a large company they are calling their ""startup"" lab, hence the lack of background check process that would otherwise be conducted by their parent company.When the company was restructured with new HR policies, I was laid off, but wasn't told it was due to anything related to my social media. They told me it was due to the economy and the nature of restructuring at the organization.I'm not sure I entirely buy that, since I received some comments in September from a senior above me who made weird ""joking"" comments outside of work off the record about a certain scandalous social media platform that I once had before I had the job, but since deleted everything about two years before I was ever hired. It was as if she knew something and was poking fun at me. My real name was never associated with that account, only my phone number.I am starting to worry there may be unfavourable content related to my phone number and email address, although I have since deleted as much as I could.I am wondering what kinds of searches do corporate HR departments use when screening candidates?I am worried about the following:Deleted tweets from deleted twitter profiles?Deleted social media profiles associated with my phone numberDeleted social media profiles associated with my personal emailDeleted social media comments associated with my phone/emailAs well, would I be able to consult a professional who could run a background check on my social media/phone number? I want to see all that is available.I have checked out the OSINT subreddit, and a few OSINT related tools, but a lot of these programs are above my tech skill level (I'm not a dev and find the command line prompts required to use these tools to be tedious)."
[FL] Retaliation Concerns Post Termination,"Hi, I was recently terminated more than halfway through my probationary period. HR said I would be in good standing if a new employer calls. I was terminated with no reason, which is allowed when you‚Äôre on your probationary period. My direct supervisor had been retaliating against me after I caught this supervisor doing something really sketchy in the beginning of my employment. This person has been a complete nightmare ever since and has been there so long they don‚Äôt really have anyone above them keeping them in check. Gaslighting, spying on me, lying, setting me up, going through my office after hours‚Ä¶I was told by HR that I can call their talent team for assistance in finding another position. I did that and the talent team said if I apply to any job within this place, the hiring department can call the department I was terminated from to speak directly with my ex supervisor. This person is incredibly vindictive. I have an exit interview with HR coming up and I don‚Äôt know what to do or how much to say. Is there a strategic way to ensure my ex supervisor cant sabotage my chances of finding another position within this huge place? If anyone can offer guidance or suggestions, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it."
[CAN] Does anyone have knowledge about hiring an employee based off a contractor's needs?,"The situation is this: a company wants to hire a new employee based of a contractor's needs. The reasoning for hiring the new employee is not based off the company's current needs.Are there any concerns or steps to take to ensure legislative compliance, etc?"
[WI] Language Discrimination,"My employer (a factory) utilizes a temp agency that sends Central/South American workers that are here in the US, usually out of TX and FL, to us because we can't find enough people up here to work.At the start, almost none of them spoke any English, which made training them all extremely hard because we had so few bi-lingual Spanish speakers. My employer let the temp agency know of this difficulty, so we got temp workers that spoke English, or at least some English.We still have employees now that don't speak English from those original groups and they're good workers. One of them had his brother-in-law come last week through the temp agency. He made it through orientation, and then on Saturday was informed he would be let go for not speaking English.Is that legal? How does an employer that already has Spanish-only speaking people working through the temp agency turn away people for not speaking English? I'm not sure how it works since they're through a temp agency, if that's a loophole for them to get away with it or not."
[CA] Why is gap time an issue?,"Hi, I have done various gig works for the past two years without having any full-time job. Recently I have started interviewing, but got questioned a lot for my gap time on resume. Why is that? Can some HR folks share some insights?"
[KS] Is this the New Normal?,"This is unacceptable. This cannot be a best practice.Job Offer[KS]  So I applied for a seasonal position at the distribution center here in Kansas I was going to be hired pending a background check. The background check took two weeks and 2 inquiries from me trying to understand what was going on. I was told that the background would be finished by 11/22. Two hours ago, I received the job offer email and I was so excited and relieved that everything went through. All I had to do was sign the offer letter in the hiring center. Just my luck, however, the screen was stuck and wouldn‚Äôt advance past the job title screen. So, I emailed the facility and waited for them to advise me on what to do.  When they did finally email me back, it was to let me know that they are no longer hiring for peak this season. I feel like I got punched in the gut. Is this how they really operate? I‚Äôm beside myself and I‚Äôd like to know what else I can do because I just can‚Äôt accept this."
is it okay to share resumes? [FL],"I have a question and I am hoping to pick the brain of an HR professional. I am not trained in this... just learning as I go. I am hiring for a full time administrative assistant role. I received 13 resumes. I have decided on a short list of 2 candidates. Another organization owned by the same owner (we do work closely together) asked to see the other 11 resumes for a different, part time role. I am just wondering if it is okay to share the resumes or not. I appreciate any insight you can provide. I tried to Google it, but didn't find anything. Thank you!!"
[NY] former employer steals personal items,"Hey guys, I need some help/ideas. I had departed a former employer mid pandemic when everyone was working remote. I was in-office with former employer for a few years and had a desk with a decent amount of personal effects. They had shipped my stuff to me and I noticed they had stole a few pairs of expensive shoes, speakers, books/mugs/small items. I emailed HR and they said they‚Äôd look into but never got back to me.

[UK] unpaid leave due to stress/mental health during probation period,"Hi all, and thanks for any advise that anyone would be able to give. I am in the UK and I have recently started a new job, have been with them for less than one month and did not have any time between jobs, my probation period is three months, extendable to six depending on performance. I am in a very delicate mental state at the moment due to excess stress from my last job and general life things during this year, I am depressed, anxious and have zero motivation which is obviously greatly affecting my performance. I obviously don't have a lot of leave to use and well aware that they could terminate my contract without much issue at this point of my employment. Q. Would it be too risky to be straight with them and talk about my mental health and request some unpaid leave for me to go home and recover my sanity for 3/4 weeks? I was thinking to push through until I pass probation but I'm really struggling and 2 more months feel too much. Any advise? Thank you!!"
[TX] not getting sick pay after everyone else did,"Long story short this is starting because I got covid from work (last Thursday, 11/10) and went back today (11/21) and after asking if I needed to test negative before returning and being told no, I was sent home for sounding sick.I was also told that the owner of the company had tested positive for 10 days and still been at the office without a mask and that I wasn‚Äôt the only person out (4 other people were).I also asked if we‚Äôd be getting covid sick pay (because everyone else up to that point had been given sick pay) and was told no. There is a lot of other things about this job that I‚Äôd like to ask about but the main question is, if there was no company policy about covid or covid pay sent out and everything had been by ear for others and I‚Äôm the only person not getting sick pay, what do I do? And why was I sent home after I was told not to get tested?"
WFO or WFH - what we all lack is more face to face time.[ca],
how do I quit? [WA],"I just started a new job and have only been there a week.I've never quit before like this, the only times I've quit was after years of being at the same job with no upward movement or pay increase and had a replacement lined up.The job is through a temp agency. The job is fine and there was nothing wrong that is making me quit, I just have poor mental health and at this point in time possibly need a ""grippy sock vacation"" haha :/This quitting will probably be through text since my manager is usually leaving when my shift starts and the agency is out of state."
[CA] I am getting retaliation for going to HR and being discriminated against for my gender?,"I believe I am getting retaliation at work and discriminate against because of my gender. I am looking for an outsider to see if this all makes sense. I recently spoke with HR because I thought my manager was about to fire me. She took away my responsibility and hired another person with my title without telling me; her manager ignored my email. The HR person told me that I would not be fired but would be placed on a PIP. This is a shocker to me because I have been traveling around the country to get the company to achieve its biggest goal this year. The CEO and another C-Suite person thanked me in front of the whole company. The HR person hinted that I should find other jobs because she and her boss (C-Suite) wanted this PIP. Even if I survive the PIP, there will be no other leadership but them that I report to. This HR person also mentioned that my manager would go on maternity leave early next year, and she wants a consultant she had worked with before I joined the company to take over her role. This news put everything in context for me, and I believe she is trying to get rid of me before she leaves.Within three weeks of my joining the company, my manager asked me to complete a critical task that usually would take 3-5 weeks to complete to be complete in 1 week. I did what she wanted and worked late into the night and early morning to push it through, even late into the night and early morning to push it through and get it done, even though I felt it was a rush job that may not have been done correctly. Mistakes were found a week later, and we had to redo it again. After the fiscal, I asked her where did she get the timeline to rush this task. She didn't have a timeline and just stated what she believed should be done now. I was shocked and realized she had never done a timeline in her career. I told her I would create a timeline for the project. At first, she supported me, but then she told me not to use work time to do this timeline, only use my free time after spending free time and pulling a couple of all-nighters building the timeline and sharing it with other functional groups. Everyone applauded me for helping them make sense of the project timeline. We learned that we could have taken more time to do the task instead of pushing ask request by the manager. At that time, I reached out to HR to ask them to help me communicate with her because she would ask to rush a task without proper planning. She also said she wants to support, but she has no intention, for example, the timeline she told me to work in my free time. HR promised they would have the head of HR reach out to me. This never happened; instead, the head of HR reached out to my manager to meet with my manager. Soon after this meeting, I was told I was not fit for the company culture and needed to take an emotionally intelligent communication Linkedin course that my manager had already taken.  After this, I could tell that my manager didn't trust me anymore as she kept me out of a lot of important information last minute, and in fact, I didn't know she was going on maternity leave until HR told me.I was the first male hire in the group where all leadership with direct reports (4 different department Directors and VP), including my manager, are female and report to a C-suite person who is also female. I was made feel aware of my gender on serval occasions. On my first day on the job, there was a meeting, and the C-suite person commented, ""all women had to fly in for the meeting. How can you trust your husband to care for your kids?"" I was the only man in the room, so I felt very awkward. Another comment was made several months later direct to me from the C-suite person ""Oh, you are married. Do you have your wife iron your clothes?"" This C-suite mentioned several times that she wanted to mentor women to be in leadership positions, which makes sense why women hold all leadership roles in the group.  My manager recently hired someone with the same job title as me, but she has four years of experience than me. The job description requires 5-year experience. She only has three years of experience. The consultant who will replace the manager on maternity leave is also a woman. I understand that this all could be a coincidence, but it is hard for me not to feel like there is some preferential treatment of the other gender."

[NJ] Can my manager force me to stay after they close?,"For reference, I‚Äôm an assistant at a hair salon. I answer phones, make appointments, wash hair for the stylists, sweep the hair, stock shelves etc. The on Wednesdays they close at 8 and Saturdays they close at 4. On Wednesday, they still had two clients sitting with color on their heads at 7:20, after they had closed. Mind you it takes at least 20 mins to apply the color, then they sit with it on for at least 30 mins and washing it out takes 15-20 mins, then we still have to clean up and take out the trash which takes 20-30 mins. There‚Äôs 3 stylists and myself who work there. Today, Saturday, a woman was still in the salon waiting to get a haircut at 3:30 and the stylist hadn‚Äôt even started yet, by the time I left which was almost an hour after my shift was over, she had still had a half a head to do. The other two stylists were also still there. I‚Äôm cleaning up my share and leaving when my shift is supposed to end, regardless if there‚Äôs still clients in the salon.

[KS] Ambulance service unpaid on call,"This will be kind of long but I‚Äôm giving as much context as possible. I work for a county government run ambulance service in December ‚Äò21 they instituted a policy for ‚Äú emergency selective call back‚Äù. This was an on the books policy for disasters and special teams but a provision was added, they could call us at anytime day or night and we would have to respond to fill a vacancy on an ambulance. We work 24 hour shifts on what is called a Berkeley shift. We have a long standing on call policy that has expanded from 5 on call days to 17 with a mix of 0800-2000 and 2000-0800. We schedule our on call days and are paid 1 regular hour per 12 hour on call block. 

 We are contacted several times a week and this policy has been utilized over 250 times since January. So it doesn‚Äôt seem like an emergency utilization so much as a staffing tool/ on call. When the policy was first announced some mid level managers started saying that there would be punishment if you didn‚Äôt come in. I contacted the deputy chief of the department and they stated ‚Äú there is no requirement that you respond to the vacancy and only that you answer your phone or respond to a text about your availability. If someone is saying otherwise they are mischaracterizing the policy.‚Äù 

 In July the policy was again changed to now after three time of us saying we‚Äôre unavailable our Battalion chief ( mid level manager) will have a coaching session and the corrective action pathway will start per county policy. They also said we have to give a reason that we are unavailable, which the management staff will decide if that‚Äôs a valid reason. I pointed out to HR that the way the policy is read and was being utilized that it is an on call policy and if the department has an expectation that I be available to come in, they would need to pay the entire department and including back pay it would be about $2 million per year. They responded by changing the policy to state ‚Äú this is not an on call day and you will not be paid as such.‚Äù 

 I had a conversation with HR and expressed concerns about the ambulance service expecting to accept the benefit of my time than I should have been compensated. So they are taking it back to the committeeMy ultimate question is how can an organization have an expectation of my off duty time when I am not being paid?

[CA][USA] Supverisor denied my ADA request for temporary WFH. Any advice is appreciated.,"HiI was on FMLA for 3 months and a 1 month leave extension through an ADA acommodation.My 1 month extension has ended and my physician has requested an ADA accomodation for a temporary work from home accomodation that would end on 04/2023. 5 months from now in order for therapy and medication to fully take effect.A 3rd party company sent in the request to my employer and the HR leave specialist forwarded that to my supervisor/manager.I found out through another supervisor (who is my friend) that my direct supervisor denied my WFH accomodation request. I am waiting to hear official word from my HR leave specialist.My department has several different locations spread across the US and there are full time employees, that have the same job desciription as I do, that work from home. A good amount of them work on site and also a lot of them work from home currently.My specific site in the department has 90% of the employees working onsite with 10% of the employees working from home on a per diem status.So I'm not understanding why my supervisor, who is also my manager, is denying my request for a 5 month temporary work from home accomodation when there are a good amount of employees, with the same exact job description and license as I do, working from home.What options do I have at this point as an employee with a confirmed disability that falls under ADA?Thanks"

[CAN-BC] How does a cost of living raise and promotion raise work together?,"I'm currently in discussions with my employer for a promotion and a raise.

[GA] I said it was possible to be racist against white people.,"I (26M) considered my coworker (24F) - let's call her Jasmine - to be a close friend. We've been working in the same place for a couple years. She said if it weren't for me and one other coworker ‚Äì let‚Äôs call her Rachel - she would have quit the first month. We shared very personal things like when she had a crush on someone in the workplace, or when I got in trouble for telling my mother my girlfriend had a UTI. I've gone ice skating with her and she had RSVP‚Äôd for my wedding. This changed one day a couple months ago. There are two incidences which could have caused offence, probably a combination of both.First thing in the morning, my supervisor asked me to help Jasmine with something. I wasn‚Äôt sure what the purpose of her experiment was, so I got confused after he gave instructions. She didn‚Äôt seem completely sure either because she‚Äôd initially gotten the wrong number of test tubes. I smiled, and asked her to explain it to me, but she got impatient and told me to go do my part. I would understand the need for this if we were running out of time, but we weren‚Äôt. I went to clarify with our supervisor. We were doing everything correctly, but my understanding of what Jasmine was doing was wrong. I think she was angry and felt patronized because I doubted her.Second encounter: My coworkers and I eat lunch together. It's not uncommon for us to have little debates about issues like politics, abortion, race, dating, circumcision, religion, or drugs. These discussions can get intense but always end in mutual respect. I walked into a discussion started by another coworker. Rachel asked Jasmine, ‚ÄúDo you think people can be racist against white people?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, because they are the ones in power.‚Äù Rachel agreed with her.I added my opinion, ‚ÄúI think they can be, white people don't have power in every situation or country. It might be different if we were in South Africa. Racial discrimination usually goes one way but it can go the other way, just like with sexism. I've talked to another coworker about this.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù Jasmine asked.‚ÄúHe said his understanding of the word ‚Äòracism‚Äô was any discrimination based on race, but that he had a friend who thought it had to involve systemic oppression.‚Äù I think it was around this time that Jasmine got up and left. I continued talking to Rachel, but I felt bad because it was obvious Jasmine was upset with me.After an hour or two I went to her bench, ‚ÄúDo you have some time to talk?‚Äù‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre mad at me.‚Äù I whispered."
"[AR] work in small private clinic for 1 ye, just received my first 1:1which concerns were addressed but then received follow-up email inflating issues and not mentioning how the concerns were addressed.","I'm an office manager for a private healthcare clinic. I've been there 1 year and on Friday just had my first 1:1 with one of the partners. She voiced the below three concerns which I addressed and/or offered solutions to. The conversation then changed to other topics as the partners keep canceling my meetings where I update them on things and ask for their feedback.ConcernsThere was one patient complaint against me in the year that I've been there. Unfortunately, the patient made a one star review about it (event occured late October but the patient made the review on 11/17/22) but the patients account of events were not accurate. I informed the owners what actually happened (I received wrong information then when the patient corrected me I seeked additional information from the clinical staff on a medical protocol as I don't have clinical background (I'm not an RN) and was able to resolve the issue) and one said ""you know how people are that post these reviews, you can't please them"". She said this because she herself, along with another owner have received one star reviews. When I've had to get information from them in order to do a patient recovery call 100% of the time the patients account is not accurate, as it doesn't match the documentation in the chart nor the Drs and nurses stories, the patient is usually upset about something else. I reiterated what occured (I had told them when they asked me on Thursday) she then said ""well, I had another patient, one of mine say you were rude, blunt when she was here last time"". She didn't provide any additional information except a description of the patient. I remembered this interaction because of the description. I was helping at the front desk because we were short staffed, during checkout I asked the patient if she could give me a minute to call her care team because her checkout slip had ""return in 4 weeks"" but it was crossed out and something else was circled. I explained this to the patient and informed her that i just wanted to call to make sure that she did not need to return I'm 4 weeks because I didn't want her to leave if she needed a follow-up appointment. I received the information, thanked her for waiting and completed the transaction. I informed the owner of this and she didn't say anything.Two late credit card payments. Due to being short staffed and unable to find candidates for the front desk, I was working full-time at the front desk from July to end of October. I was coming in early, staying late and working weekends just so I could catch up in my own work as office manager. In September and October I made a one day late credit card payment. I informed the owner that these are the only two times this has happened in the 1 year I've been there and the payments were made on a Saturday when I had come in to work considering I had been working full-time  at the front desk. I also informed her that it won't happen again as I've out things in place (I made myself reminders). She didn't say anything.Supply shortages. Due to previous workflows not working, the clinical staff was using up supplies (meds, vaccines, devices) until they were completely out and not following supply workflows, thus resulting in running out of needed supplies. Earlier this spring I implemented a new workflow and added labels on all the medical supplies, medications, vaccines and devices in red ink that say ""almost out! Time to reorder!"" When the staff get to one of these they're supposed to write it down on the supply request form that's available in the supply closet. Every week I order what's on the list. Well, some of the employees are not following the supply workflows and ignoring the labels, so about 3 (end of October) weeks ago we ran completely out of a medical device. I was at the front desk and the owners that were in clinic seeing patients were texting me ""what are you going to do?"". I went to them and they started questioning me why we ran out and I was honest and told them I didn't know we were out until one of the nurses told me the day before. I placed an order to be overnighted to us but the vendor shipped it ground instead. I called our rep to see if he had any medical devises he could drop off but he didn't, and there was nothing he could do to assist with expediting our order. I ended up calling another clinic and we borrowed the medical devise from them. To avoid this situation in the future I locked up all the extra medicine, vaccines and devices. I give the clinical staff what they need for their nurses stations and when they come to a red label they come to me and I give them more supplies from the locked inventory. This workflow has been working and we haven't ran out since this incident.I took the 9am 1:1 as constructive criticism and asked the owner to let me know if there's any other issues or patient complaints, as I'd like to know how I may remedy the situation(s). She agreed and thanked me for my time. I thought the meeting ended in a good note.Then at 4pm when I was in the middle of a whole clinic phone upgrade I received a meeting follow-up email from the owner. She cc'd the other partners and mentioned the above three concerns, however, she didn't mention how I addressed her concerns (didn't mention anything that I had said) and instead stated that there were ""multiple patient complaints"" and ""multiple late credit card payments"". She ended the email with ""If you need help resolving these issues or have any questions, please let me or one of the other physicians know.""I've been a healthcare office manager for 6 years and this is my first time working in private practice. In the 1 year I've been with my employer this is my first 1:1 and have never received an email like this (nor from my previous employers) and I'm now worried that they're gonna fire me. A part of me wants to reply as not everything addressed was in her email, or should I bring it up at the next meeting (if they don't cancel) or not do/say anything?ETA: it's a business of about 25 employees, I am the administrator for the clinic and the owners 2nd business of 5 employees. Besides the billing manager it's just me doing everything (HR, payroll, general business administration, etc.). Of note, I'm currently 24 weeks and due in March."
An Actual Shitlist [AZ],"OK so I was in my supes office the other day having a private convo. In the middle of formulating an answer to one of her questions my eyes happened onto this bold red type on the part of the whiteboard where an open door would've covered. She had a bulleted list of...I guess infractions committed by her employees. Some were day shift, some on the second shift and it was all petty type shit like ""12:00 Bob walked away midsentence while I was talking"". From what I saw they were more like personal slights as opposed to breaking any rules. When I realized what I was looking at I cut the conversation short without making it obvious and left. The entire night I thought ""There is no way I saw what I saw. It had to be something else"". The next morning I verified it with another employee. So as juvenile as what she did sounds I'm not exactly sure it violates any rules. Could this be considered harrassment?? Surely it violates those peoples privacy, right? I feel obligated to say something but I dont want to be pulling a fire alarm for what might wind up being a non issue to management. Appreciate any help."

[VA] Can I ask HR to get myself excused from company dinners citing covid as concern?,"Basically, I want to make it so that I can get out of going to any sort of off-hour company parties or dinners.Why I want buy-in from HR is so that I can assure that there is no room for pressure from anyone to say anything to me about these events. I don't want to see these people for things like this. I deal with them for the whole week. I don't need to see them for ""celebration"".I can easily refuse by lying, true, but this won't work over time. Assuming I want to continue to make it so that I cannot attend any of these events legally, is there any kind of thing I can arrange with my HR to make it so that I cannot attend these events? Maybe use covid as an excuse or something?"
[CA] Curious if this is harassment and if I should report it,"A few months ago, a new director was hired at my company. This person is not my direct boss, but I interact with them daily. I am not sure if I am overthinking this or if there‚Äôs a problem with his behavior. This is the list of ‚Äúweird‚Äù incidents:The first day we met, the very first thing he said to me after hello was ‚Äúyou look so good.‚Äù There are now near-daily comments on my appearance and what I‚Äôm wearing. Always ‚Äúpositive,‚Äù but it is constant, to the point I try to wear very plain and normal clothes to avoid interacting with him.Barely a week after meeting him, a gift was left on my desk from him. It was a fairly expensive gift.On my birthday, an astrology book was left on my desk with my birthday earmarked.I was already uncomfortable about the gifts, but then a few weeks later he asked me to come to his office. He tried to get me to climb up to a loft area ‚Äî I was wearing a dress and he would have been standing below me. I refused and he left the room but his laptop was open pointed in my direction. It was very strange and I was concerned that he was recording, so I just stood there for two minutes and pretended I had gone to look at the loft.I believe I made it clear that I was not receptive to any advances by being very short with him and there were a few weeks where I felt like I was being ‚Äúpunished.‚Äù Being told no just to be shown who is the boss. I still feel this way sometimes.At our last video call, after answering, he pointed the camera at his crotch. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and said I couldn‚Äôt see his face. He finally moved the camera after a moment and said he was just trying to show me his dog.Am I overreacting or is this a pattern? Like I said, the appearance and outfit comments have remained constant. There are also lots of other examples of employee code violations but none of them are harassment related so I didn‚Äôt think I should include them."
"[WA] HR Question- appearance, the way I talk","I started a new job in August. I dress appropriately, but my boss has repeatedly told me I need to wear make-up. I wear mascara, but told her my skin is very sensitive skin and I haven‚Äôt found a foundation or powder that works. She said I should at least wear lipstick. Last week, we were having a casual conversation while driving between accounts. She interrupted me & said I say ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúyou know‚Äù too often. She said that it‚Äôs all she can focus on when I talk, and that I have to concentrate on not saying the phrases. I need to stop saying them all the time, not just at work. If I only try to not say them during work, my interactions with buyers won‚Äôt seem genuine. All of this criticism is creating a lot of anxiety. I‚Äôm constantly worried about my appearance & what I‚Äôm saying. I live on the West coast & my city is very casual. Has my boss overstepped? I feel like she‚Äôs getting into a grey area by criticizing my appearance and speech."
[Ca] Reported Bullying Behavior with Physical Aggression but was told by Director to treat this at a lowest level.,"I have experienced multiple bullying/hostile treatment of screaming and shouting by a co- worker (all with witnesses). This bully is known to have a close tie with upper management. She always brags as how many hours she is donating to the company as she stay over almost every day just to finish work for FREE. Bully would drop names and say ‚Äú Mr so and so told me that if someone is giving me a hard time I will let him know‚Äù She would give me some of her work saying it‚Äôs part of my responsibility while I am overwhelmed with my own responsibilities. The recent incident was she was screaming and pointing fingers at me in front of my teammates about a phone call that is supposed to be for her. I told the other person on the line that the phone call is meant for her as she handle those type of cases. She heard me mentioned her name but instead of clarifying what this phone call about she was screaming and pointing fingers at me and threaten me ‚ÄúYOU will SEE‚Äù I was so humiliated by her disrespectful behavior towards me in-front of my team, I stood up and told her (not yelling) but firm ‚Äúcan we talk in a professional way?‚Äù I said I don‚Äôt understand why you are acting this way?‚Äù Why so much hatred? All of a sudden I saw my other team mate got pushed by the bully to the ground. My team mate decided to go in between us to stop the whole drama but she got pushed by bully. The next day I found out that she reported incident to the management with her own version. I Reported bullying incident to my supervisor via email. Later the director sent someone to train in my position of which the bully said the director had asked her (the bully) opinion‚Äôs on who else can train in my position. I had meeting with director two weeks after the incident and was told that If I cannot work with her I have to re- evaluate myself cause positions  including mine will be awarded by bid and management pick and that he wanted the incident to be treated in the lowest level. I felt threatened, intimidated and scared. I told the witnesses that I don‚Äôt want them to take sides but I expect them to tell the truth as I was hoping management will be fair in their investigations. One of the supervisor was asked to inquire from witnesses but when they found out the truth- they kept quiet but they did not ask written statements from me the bully and witnesses. 2 weeks after, they were adding more work to me,  I ask copy of the minutes of the meeting but didn‚Äôt get one.I felt unfairly treated, I felt the company didn‚Äôt live up to their standard. I was extremely under stress, sleeplessness, sick. I left the department because the whole thing was affecting my mental and psychological well-being. I‚Äôm still with the company and the thought of it still affects  me. Any advice is appreciated."
[IN] Intern seems oblivious to professional norms and it's hurting his job search and burning bridges everywhere,"At my organization, I'm partly in charge of a man who's near halfway through his year-long paid internship with us.  He's not performing well and has alienated almost everyone, and the direct feedback we've been giving him doesn't seem to be making much impact.  Here are some reasons why:- he is given a list of tasks to do and instructions for how to do them, but he ignores these tasks and claims he was never told about them.- he is not a considerate officemate.  I have received a lot of feedback from people who sit near him that he is extremely loud, talks on his phone for hours in his native language while sitting at his desk, and isn't mindful that others need to do work (their roles are such that they cannot wear noise-canceling headphones while doing their jobs)- he doesn't respect his higher-ups.  My industry is pretty hierarchical, with deference expected while interfacing with people above you in the org chart.  He will knock on higher-ups' office doors or walk right in, ask if they have five minutes for a quick question, and proceed to talk on and on until he is asked to leave, about a range of topics that, frankly, he should be researching for himself.  He does this to me often.  I have stopped him and told him it's not a good time, and ask him to come back at a specific time later in the day, which he does not do.  Even when I send him a calendar invite for later in the day and he accepts it, he still won't show up at the appointed time, and does not apologize when I next see him.This man was born and raised outside the US and is on a temporary visitor visa in the US.  In order to stay in the US after his visa ends, he will need a full-time job offer by an employer who is willing to sponsor him (at much cost to them) to eventually get a green card.  As it happens, we have an internal opening in our organization, which he interviewed for, but due to his performance so far, he will not be hired.  So, he has been interviewing externally, and while there's a lot of demand for his skill set, he's had no offers.  He will come talk to me after almost every interview and complain about the slightest things -- how someone made an offhand remark that offended him, how one of his interviewers told him that the role was quite busy and he didn't like that, how he didn't like that he had to interview with a specific person and he complained to the person organizing the interview about this (!!!), how a hiring manager asked him to meet her at a Starbucks for a preliminary conversation prior to a formal interview day and he felt that was inappropriate, how a hiring manager tried to sell him a job by talking about the generous compensation and he didn't like that (!!!), etc.  I have been listening patiently and offering impartial advice.  I have also tried to be very frank with him that no job is perfect, especially not the very first job you get right out of internship training, and that his visa status may be a hindrance for some employers.  As the months drag by and he continues having apparently negatively experiences everywhere he interviews, it's clear he's not taking my advice on board, and he's probably showing up to them the same way he's showing up to us -- basically, making a poor impression and torching his chances of getting hired anywhere.My industry is pretty small, and I've heard unofficially from some other colleagues at different organizations that he's indeed not interviewing well and turning people off.  I've also heard indirectly that his references from other organizations are not giving him good reviews.  (Thankfully, he has not asked me to be a reference for him -- and I do not think I could be, in good conscience.)I'm struggling with how to manage this situation going forward.  Any resources for how to instill professionalism and self-awareness into someone like this, since direct and pointed feedback isn't working?   (Sadly, I don't have the authority to put him on a PIP or terminate him -- the person who hired him is very unlikely to be on board with either of these plans.)  I'm also worried about my own professional reputation in this small industry, in the high likelihood that he won't change if/when he finds a full-time job and burns bridges at his next organization too."
"[NV] I'm curious about what HR would do, of anything: (1) abusive and oppressive communication, (2) lack of staff","I (F) have a slew of issues that are compounding. I am considering taking them all to HR, but I'm concerned about retaliation. I'm also curious if HR can do anything. Issue 2 is more recent, but Issue 1 is ongoing.Back story is that I'm a rehire I used to be friends with the people who brought me back (""Ted"" and (""Dave"").  The boss above Ted and Dave is a badass, so we will call him ""GOAT"". Ted and Dave work in a different specialty, and we dont work together on any projects (I have one with Dave, but he doesnt do anything on it, and he doesnt respond to emails, show to meetings, etc).There is a third boss; he's just cool. GOAT and third boss work in my specialty, and we work together often. I like my work, and I like working with GOAT and third boss a lot.Eta:  Ted and Dave are still my superiors, even though we don't work together on projects. Ted (first boss), Dave (second boss), third boss, then GOAT (everyone's boss).Generally: Ted and Dave are pretty overtly nasty to me.  If I say goodmorning to them, they ignore me (idc, I don't really want to talk to them, im just trying to be professional). Their emails are always curt and accusatory.  They're never helpful, and I have not had a pleasant communication with either of them in 11 months.  With that said, I don't work with them, so they're easy to avoid.ISSUE 1: Ted is in charge of staffing, and support staff.  Currently, we have only have 2 actual support staff and almost 20 professionals. This means that    10 professionals are assigned to 1 support staff. I've never heard of staff having more than 3 or maybe 4 professionals at a time in my field.This obviously leads to a lot of complaints from the support staff about being overwhelmed.  Ted's solution is to push support staff duties onto the professionals.  I already work 10 hours a day doing my professional work.  This added 2 or more hours of work to my day.  During a 5-day work week, I am working 12 hours a day, if not more.Ted messed up by trying to make GOAT take over some support staff work relating to a project that I was staffed on, and GOAT put Ted in his place. I didn't tell GOAT, he found out through his own channels. But that only fixed the 1 project (so maybe it saves me 30 minutes a day). We still have the underlying issue of being poorly staffed.Is there anything HR can do?ISSUE 2 In my spare time, I started a voluntary lunch group at the firm for the professionals (and staff. If they wanted to join), to discuss changes in our field and how to approach particular problems. Third boss joined, receieves all emails and calendaring.  He has attended meetings as well.  GOAT didn't want to attend."
[FL] Boss is bullying/berating me,"So I‚Äôm currently getting my masters and before the fall semester started I told my supervisor I had to do an internship for the fall in July. We had a meeting about it with two other supervisors who were fine with it and just wanted me to send information about it so I did. And everything was good.There was a delay because of the onboarding process and I didn‚Äôt start until the end of September and my school was like here‚Äôs the start date. I was going to go in my first day and get my schedule and let my job know.Well my big boss got looped in and she kept pressing me about a schedule I didn‚Äôt have and ccd all the supervisors between our email correspondence and I was like it was on Tuesday and Wednesday.So I went for another meeting and she pretty much berated me about not knowing how to communicate and put in time off. Which I have email proof about putting in time off months in advance, and the email in July talking about my internship, and another email with information about the internship. And she was pretty much bullying me and yelling at me while my supervisor just sat there silently.Ever since that meeting my supervisor won‚Äôt talk to me unless my boss is on it, it was never like that before we were pretty good, and she just bullies me about taking sick leave when I have a doctors note stating otherwise or literally anything.Also there‚Äôs another person doing an internship at my job and they are working with her no problem.I am literally being targeted and bullied and idk if I should take it to HR and what to say. As I am not the first person who‚Äôs been bullied by her.Help?"
[MN] Management Stealing Tips,"For some back story, I am a CSR at a large dog boarding facility in Minnesota that caters to wealthy healthcare employees. A typical night stay is around $80. Our general manager is the husband of the silent owner of the company. He has never worked in this compacity and makes decisions based on youtube videos he has watched without consulting the rest of the staff.We recently upgraded our card readers to the new Clover readers and we now have a tip function which we did not before. When we push a transaction to the card readers the readers now ask the customer if they would like to leave a tip for the boarding stay. We did not think that customers would really use the function but we accrued around $3,000 in tips in less than a month.I heard some rumors that management was planning on using that money towards company parties and upgrading equipment for the business. I have worked in HR and have taken over some roles here including advising the general manager on HR-related topics. I printed off and explained Title 29, Subpart D - Tipped Employees ¬ß 531.50 to my General Manager. He asked me if we really needed to tell the employees that they are being tipped since most don't actually know since it is new. I told him yes we did and he told me I was a purist and that I interpret the law differently than he does.Even knowing our employees are paid over minimum wage and have not signed anything regarding tips they are still entitled to receive those tips correct? They are paid bi-weekly, how soon after those tips are processed do they have to be disbursed to the employees? Management has been sitting on these tips for several pay periods trying to figure out how to use them. Also, who would be the best to contact if they do decide to not give the tips to employees?"
[VA] Have you ever dealt with a situation like this?,"If you work remotely as a recruiter and you hire a bunch of people to fill a call center job. Maybe not even a bunch, say 15 or less.Some employees can work from home, others can't. There is an office that is available to report to work.The job doesn't pay much. One of the employees is homeless and living in their car. Or maybe two or three.What if during the first week, they wear the same clothing because they don't have money to replace what they lost and are starting over from nothing.They can work, think, use a computer. They may even have high credentials and experience. But they were only hired at the lower level. They ask for a little bit more at negotiation stage. They aren't given more. So they can't rent a place to live.Its a jeans and sneakers work culture. Will wearing the same black pants, top and shoes be a problem?"
[NY] coworker keeps coming to work sick,"I work closely with this woman at work that keeps coming to work sick. In the last two months she has had RSV, COVID, and now the flu. She comes to the office everyday ill and leave partway through the day (except Covid when she was ordered to stay home, but she came in days before very sick but testing negative).I have health struggles and had a surgery recently. I had to test negative for Covid or the surgery would have been rescheduled until next year. Luckily, I asked to work from home to avoid that.I can not keep getting sick with my health issues. I also am pissed she keeps doing this. We have others that are struggling with health issues and can not afford to get sick either. What can I do? I want to talk to the owner. And it‚Äôs so damn stupid of her because we can work from home. Why can‚Äôt she just stay at home instead of bringing this crap in the office?"
Performance review tools [UK],Can you recommend some good performance review tools?
[IL] Covid Illness,Covid illnessI was out with Covid April of 2020 and was super sick. Of course during this time I was not able to pay all of my bills. When I got off Disability my company made me resign. I have a new job offer and of course they are going to run a background check. Should I prep them about my credit issues or let me come to me for questions. Please note I did get into a Cares Act program to resolve my debt about a year ago.
Federal HR [MI],"I work for the VA and I recently about 3 months ago) switched to a new department. I am new to HR, especially federal HR... we are nonbargaining employees so union cannot help. I am being treated poorly and differently than other employees. I am not usually a complainer but I feel like leadership is out to get me. I have never been treated so horribly before. I notice the way that leadership interacts with other employees vs me is considerably different. I am being watched by everyone for every little thing I do. I am consistently told I am not allowed to do things that others are allowed to do. I cannot take this anymore, it is very discouraging. I try my best. I offer to do extra work etc and nothing helps. I feel like they are purposely discriminating against me or maybe creating a hostile work enviroment? (I am an out LGBT member and ever since they found out, everything has changed) What are my options? Who can I go to? Is there a way I can get a reassignment out of this leadership?"
"[NJ] The company I work for just sent notice that NJ employees will lose 40hrs of PTO to accommodate the mandatory sick time we accrue due to NJ laws, is this legal?","I work for a retail company with locations all over the US. I'm a FT, hourly employee in a retail store. NJ requires employers to provide up to 40 hours of sick leave per year. This is accumulated 1 hour of sick leave per 30 hours worked. The company sent notice to all employees in my state and some select other locations with the same law stating that we will have 40 hours of PTO taken from our annual PTO to essentially cover the 40 hours we get in sick leave. Their justification is to make it fair for the employees not getting the sick leave hours, I guess.Is this legal? Sick time isn't rolled over, and doesn't get applied in a lump sum at the start of the year, unlike PTO. So I  have 88 hours of PTO every year, but they will be taking 40 of that, leaving me with 48 hours of PTO. Then I have to wait for my sick leave to build through the year so I may earn back the 40 I lost. They say the sick leave can be used for any reason, implying it could be used for vacation instead of it's intended purpose of being used for sick leave."
[MI] does job offer letter mean i got the job and i shouldn't worry anymore?,I just wanted to confirm it but here is the situation. 2 weeks ago I got a job offer letter from big company and accepted it with start date in January. The offer had all details from salary to job grade to benefits to pto.... Also got background check passed 3 days after. The only thing is there is no communication from HR anymore but they already sent welcome to the team email and the documents i need to bring on first day.Is it normal for HR not to keep checking until start date? Anything i have to do during this time? I never had a long waiting time for start date that's why. I actually requested that because my bonus is in late December.Thank you all!
[MN] Would it be a terminable offense to do paid surveys while at work on work computer?,"I work for a large business and there is a lot of downtime. We all have computers assigned to our areas and once all the work is done there is truly not much else for us to do other than sit and wait for something to happen. Where I work we are not allowed to have our cellphones on us. I have seen plenty of coworkers play online video games. I do not like video games so I logged into my online survey thing and began taking paid surveys. A coworker, who frequently plays video games on their work computer on the clock, said to me I should not be taking paid surveys because in their eyes I am working a 2nd job in my current job and getting paid somehow - I should just play video games online like everyone else when there is a lot of downtime.Is my coworker right?"
[GA](GA) - LCSW/Inpatient Geriatric Psychology Provider now being asked to complete intake and billing functions without pay.,"Background: I work for a company that provides inpatient psychiatric services to SNF (nursing home) patients. Basically, if a patient is admitted to a SNF on any psychotropic med, the facility refers them to us for medication management and psychotherapy. I am an LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker) in GA. I see patients in 9 different SNF's. I usually complete an initial diagnostic evaluation (CPT: 90791), create a note, and am then paid a fee-for-service rate for the encounter. The company does all the credentialing, billing, intake, consents, assignment of benefits, and PR. If I feel as though the patient needs ongoing services, I will put them on my caseload and then bill out 90834, 90837, and 90832 - whichever is appropriate for subsequent encounters.Past operating procedure (prior to today): The SNF would identify a patient who needed our services. The facility would complete a consent either with the patient or w/ family if patient is cognitively impaired. The facility would also get an ""assignment of benefits"" (AOB) signed by patient/family indicating that we could bill insurance for the provider's (my) services - usually Medicare. I also have an ""admin time"" billing code where the company pays me about half of my hourly rate for administrative duties outside of seeing patients.Last week, the company laid off approximately 70 employees - mostly from intake / authorization team. There was a mandatory (unpaid) Zoom call today. We (providers) learned:The previous intake team was not loading the consents      and AOB to the patients file.This revelation was the result of an audit.We (the providers) are now required to go back to every      single patient on our caseload and get a new consent/AOB (even if they      recently signed one, but wasn't loaded).We will be locked out from opening notes (and being      able to see/bill patients) unless we go back and get all consents/AOB's      re-signed.We will not be paid any administrative time for      completing this task which was not our responsibility until today.My estimate is that this will be about 75-100 hrs of      work over the course of 6-8 weeks considering my frequency of patient      visits and difficulty in obtaining consents.Additional Information:- On my job description, under FLSA Status is states ""W2-employed Fee-For-Service"". I don't know if this means that I am exempt or non-exempt from FLSA. It's not listed on my paycheck."
[CAN-AB] EI and voluntarily leaving job,"Can I get EI if I leave my job? Here is my situation.My job is an office job. When Covid hit we went remote for with no issues, I was able to complete all my job requirements.  During the first year I decided to move into the country to live with my BF. Fast-forward 2ish years and Covid is no longer regulated by the government and  I have been mandated to go back to the office. My manager does know my new living situation, which is 1.5hr drive each way. Since she told me I need to be in the office I have decided that it is time to get a new job.Would I qualify for EI?"
Do background checks only go back 7 years? [IN],I applied to this company a couple years ago and they rescinded the job  offer because I have a misdemeanor for marijuana from 2014. I reapplied  and now it has been 8 years since this misdemeanor and I got a job offer  from them again. I wasn't going to even disclose it on the background  check this time. Do they only go back 7 years?
[NE] PTO after being rehired,"I was laid off last month, and got rehired at the same company after 4 weeks. As a part of the layoff, they paid out my PTO. I want to negotiate with HR if it is possible for me to pay them back the cash payout to reinstate my previous PTO. Is that a common/possible scenario, or once the PTO is paid out I will never get it back? Thank you!"
[NY] Should I leave job off resume?,"Hey all,So I work in tech (in product) and I've been at my current role just over 4 months. I really dislike it and want to look for something new ASAP. Before taking this role, I took a 10 month personal sabbatical.Keeping that sabbatical in mind, should I leave my current role off my resume? If I leave it off, it shows a 14 month gap between leaving my last job and now (and this time will only get longer as I look around). Or should I include this new role on the resume?I know typically leaving a short-term role off the resume isn't a big deal, but when combining it with my sabbatical, it might raise a red flag on the perceived 14+ month work gap.Any advice would be great, thank you!"
[MN] Federal/State/County/City EEO compliance question,"For filling said roles, is there a minimum number of applicants that must be interviewed for a designated role to keep up with EEO standards?Ex: Let's say that a popular role got seven or so candidates, and there was a solid pick out of the 7. Would EEOC regulations require you to open the job post again to wait for x amount of candidates to apply even though you know who you're going to pick from the first roster of candidates?Thanks!"
"[NY] I said a culturally inappropriate thing but I didn't know it'll be considered inappropriate. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE HELP. My verbal 95% offer is in jeopardy.","Okay, so I am a stupid and dumbass person. I got the verbal offer and as the last step, 'informally', I spoke to Chief Compliance Officer. I mentioned I left my last job due to cultural differences - this person who I was working with was Jewish and other senior officials were Jewish and all other employees in this small company complained about this rude guy and no one took action ever. A lot of people have left the company due to this favouritism, and their inaction towards this person.Just to clarify - I am from South- East Asia, a Hindu, and I absolutely had no idea it could be taken as anti-semitic (I wasn't cognizant about it). Okay, I am the most idiot person around, but my intention wasn't anti-semitic. Like I don't even know a lot about Judaism and neither do I understand what's the deal with anti-sentiments against them. Tbh, I didn't know the way I was articulating could be construed as anti-semitic.My intention was not to say the whole section of people are like that. I just meant people in that company and their culture is such. It was a boy's club and they were douchebags and they acted like assholes, rude, disrespectful and condescending. I've been in the U.S for 4 years now but let's just I am a fucking idiot. Now, what can I do to salvage the situation? What can I write or say to make my case? My verbal 95% offer is in jeopardy."
[FR] Autistic struggles at work: how to manage the impact of my neurodiversity in my career?,"I am an Autistic mid-career level manager at a startup company. HR and management are not aware of my neurodiversity nor of my struggles.My role requires that I travel with other team members to attend events, seminars and conferences, among other duties. I have no trouble whatsoever carrying out professional duties expected of someone in my role - I go above and beyond to offer the best possible service and generally obtain positive feedback.During these industry events and travels, however, employees are expected to stick together and participate in all kinds of social events that while not mandatory by any means, appear to be an important part of company and industry culture; like lunch together, dinner together, drinks together, etc. Since local culture puts strong emphasis on personal connections, such events open doors and might act as the primary building blocks of your reputation as a professional (which sometimes outweighs your actual performance on the job - eg. personality can trump skill and output).Largely due to my ASD, I cannot take part in such events, as much as I would like to. I simply have no energy left at the end of a long day at an industry show to do any more socialising off-the-clock, my social fuel being absolutely dry after 8 hours of on-the-clock talking to potential clients. I have tried in the past, but the result was either terrible migraines, skin rashes or a stomach ulcer. (So please, don‚Äôt tell me to make an effort sometimes - every day is already a huge effort as is)So I politely but consistently turn down social invitations from co-workers for after work anything. I thank them for thinking of me, but explain that I‚Äôm very tired and need to go to the hotel and rest. This has caused my team to treat me different, and I know there is gossip and speculation about my personality and lifestyle. I don‚Äôt know how to navigate this in a professional manner that is honest, but doesn‚Äôt require me to expose my neuro diversity to those who might not understand. I also fear for my future and career options - whether I am eligible for a promotion, a raise, or even if I can be trusted as someone who acts different from the norm.Is there any advice you all could offer to help me navigate this? As I stand, I know that my invisible disability is going to massively impact my career down the line, and ai have no clue how to help it."
[IL] So whats next?,I got hired yesterday for a customer service position. I have already signed the Offer letter online and also sent the documents that they asking for to their email. So now what? My first day of work is on Monday 21st Nov. They haven‚Äôt sent me anything since the offer letter. Am I supposed to contact them or will they? This is a completely remote position and also my first job and I am very confused.
[TX] Question about an incident at work,"I work for a company that is virtual and I was hired as a Texas employee but their headquarters is in a different state.There was recently an issue where I was supposed to be delivered company equipment. It was delivered to my old address so I had somebody return it. The company told me they would send me a new package at my address.I was informed the company did not have a record of the return because the label was not scanned. They asked me for the tracking number but we didn‚Äôt have the receipt anymore from when we returned it months ago. I asked my family member who returned if they had the receipt and I asked my other family member to call the post office (I do not have international calls)They also asked me if I received the new package. I did not receive a package, I did not receive a delivery notice, and I also did not receive a phone call. I never got the tracking information for it either. I assumed that they probably just wanted to confirm the return before sending me new equipment, because so much time had passed that I would‚Äôve definitely received a new computer if they sent it out to me.Recently, I had a meeting with a supervisor. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to work that day until the issue was sorted out. They IMPLIED and ALLUDED to many things so they could say whatever they wanted to me and I would not be able to complain, as they did not outright accuse me. I felt extremely uncomfortable either way.They referred to the return of the package in the conditional tense, as if we didn‚Äôt actually return it (they also said ‚Äúmaybe they just told you they did‚Äù), they threatened me with the cost of recovering the equipment, they told me my email responses were vague (because I answered using only the information that was available to me at the time- they pulled up the new delivery courier and tracking number in the same meeting which was the very first time I was hearing about it, and told me there was a delivery attempt. I had no idea when they asked me.)They were also very condescending to me. They said I wasn‚Äôt taking the situation seriously and I was not actively working to solve it. They then gave me a deadline to ‚Äúprovide some answers‚ÄùFor the new package: I entered the very same information w the tracking that was given to me and I saw in two minutes that it was returned to the warehouse. I called and confirmed with the courier.For the return: I had my family member phone the post office again and they said they could see where the package was if I contacted my company and asked them for the original tracking details on the prepaid label. I phoned the supervisor who seemed inconvenienced and they contacted the appropriate authorities. This whole time I was under the impression I‚Äôd be fired or fined by that deadline, so I don‚Äôt appreciate that they also left me in the dark while waiting for that response.All they said the very next day was ‚Äúyeah it was returned.‚Äù Not a single apology. They sent me two emails and a text right after, asking for me to respond to the emails."
[OH] Employee vacation policy updates.,"Our company has implemented a new vacation policy, where it takes a shorter amount of time to get more vacation.Old System Years (3, 10, 20, 30).New System Years (3, 5, 10, 20).An issue we are running into is an employee was a temp hire in 2013, and was hired on full time officially in 2014. Should that employee get 2013 (10 Year) or 2014 (wait another year)?My inclination is to argue that he has hit his 10 year, using the FMLA logic of temp workers count towards for FMLA Status of at least X amount of employees.Am I missing something that would prevent this person from getting the 10 year bump?Thanks in advance!"
[NY] sexual harassment/ bullying?,"I am a female and another female coworker of mine has started slowly (in my opinion) bullying me. It started one morning when I sent her a work chat requesting a document that I was missing. She walked over and pulled me out of the meeting that I was in to ask me why I didn‚Äôt say good morning and if I was overwhelmed. There has been other occasions where I would be working with someone and she would just come and asked the person to go with her and not even acknowledge my presence or that I was working with that person.Then a good coworker of mine came to me and said she was asking about if him and I had sexual relations and he was very upset because he knows that I am married and wanted to insist that he would never do anything to jeopardize my marriage because he respects me, my marriage and our friendship. I didn‚Äôt confront her about it because of how I saw things escalating with her but then one day someone had a concern about my work and mentioned it to her and instead of her calling me over to clarify it or even elevating it to management, she took it upon herself to get a written statement and arrange a one on one meeting with me. The meeting was set for days later and during that time other people were mentioning that she was filing an official report against me, but she has no one of authority and doesn‚Äôt have the power to file an official report.When I went to talk about side complaints, she insisted on keeping a written statement and suggested that I follow up with that person for clarity (again not my immediate supervisor to offer me next steps). After she was like well since I have you here can we talk about what‚Äôs going on with us because there has never been any conflict between us and I feel like you were acting weird towards me (this is still at work during working hours) I mentioned the way that she pulls me and others out of my meeting without saying anything. And then I mentioned that my coworker mentioned something to me that was quite disturbing so I decided to keep my distance. She started going off and saying that she wanted to fuck that guy I needed to know if he fucked me first because she feel like she saw me have gestures towards him that may indicate that we had a thing. I insisted that she didn‚Äôt need to say my name or get me involved she could have just asked if he was with anyone. She kept insisting that if she wanted to ‚Äúfuck him‚Äúshe needed to know if he was fucking me first.It‚Äôs all conversation made me uncomfortable and I ended up leaving. Later she sent me a message saying that she didn‚Äôt like the way things ended but since we are still on the same team we have to make sure and still act professional towards each other. I responded that we are not on the same team if she went out of her way to get a written statement about me (not standard from coworker to coworker). She then sent me like a seven page long text message about how I am creating an issue out of nothing and I am playing a victim and I have been avoiding her and the team for a while now and is creating a hostile environment for myself and others. I ended up writing an email to my direct supervisor asking if we can limit the amount of time that her and I work together.I was just curious if this is considered bullying/harassment and also are the conversations that she had with my coworker considered sexual harassment? I can‚Äôt see it appropriate for her to think that it‚Äôs OK to ask if I am ‚Äúfucking ‚Äúa coworker and justify it because she wanted to make sure that I didn‚Äôt sleep with him first."
Sterling background check [MN],"I am graduating college this upcoming December and got an offer from my dream company. Its contingent on my passing of the Sterling Background check and drug test. I'm not at all worried about the drug test, but as far as the background check goes, I'm a little stressed.I'm newly 21 and I've never done this before. For the employment history, I did the dates to the best of my knowledge, but I've only worked small odd and end college jobs off and on for 4 years. I'm worried that I could be off by a a few weeks or maybe a month on a few of the start/end dates. The same worry goes for my past addresses as I just went off what my parents told me.Additionally, I got a minor in consumption when I was 17 and it was dismissed but not expunged. I obviously didn't bring this up because I never thought I'd have to and they never asked about crimes. Do you think I will fail the background check because of this?Thank you so so much"

[PH] Getting anxious with an internal transaction,"I have a feeling that I am involved in an illegal transaction within the company unknowinglyHello HRs,A few months ago, I was asked by a friend that his manager needed help if they could pass a compensation to my payroll account and once I got that compensation I would send it back to him.That compensation is a referral bonus.That manager's excuse is he's helping that 'referred' employee and promised that he will be giving out that compensation to that employee. I agreed to this and once I received that amount I sent it out immediately to him.Now, it seems that the upper management is looking back on the referral data and I am getting anxious if that transaction will get me into an undesirable position.Both my friend and that manager are already no longer with the company since last month."
[TX] I need help boss told me severance or PIP!,On Wednesday my boss did our normal check in we talked about projects till the last 5 minutes after that she started crying saying I either take a ‚Äú2 week severance‚Äù or a PIP but she said a pip wouldn‚Äôt work for me basically trying to persuade me.

"[TX] Broke my knee at work, my manager didn‚Äôt submit an accident report","I‚Äôve (48f) worked at this company for 20 years, and two years ago, I broke my leg while on the job. It was well known that this happened at work, in fact two people saw when it happened and helped me. My manager didn‚Äôt write up an accident report, and I didn‚Äôt think any of it at the time, as I have good healthcare and wasn‚Äôt worried about copays or having enough PTO for recovery. I was (and still am) a lower level manager.Recently one of my direct reports injured himself at work, and as I was writing his accident report, I made sure he understood this was for his benefit, because if there was permanent nerve damage, or the injury was worse than we originally thought, it is in his best interest to make sure it‚Äôs known this was a workplace injury.This made me think about my own injury. I‚Äôm getting older and things are not healing as quickly or easily anymore, I have more aches and pains than I used to. What if my knee ends up starting to cause problems due to arthritis because of the injury I got at work? I‚Äôve had to take off a couple days here and there this year due to sciatica, and also other back pain issues (unrelated to the leg injury, my point is that I‚Äôm just having to start taking time off cause of my body is not 20 yo anymore!!)Is it too late to report the broken leg, and was it my responsibility to fill out my own accident report because I am an actual manager and have filled these out for my own direct reports so I understand the need for them? Could my manager get in trouble for not writing this up for me?If it‚Äôs too late, it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôll move on and won‚Äôt worry about what MIGHT happen.I live in the USA, and work for a large company with over 6,000 ‚Äòemployees. And also, my job is one where I am physically active, and mobility is very important to my daily tasks."

[CA] Written Up While Out On Short Term Disability,"Hello AskHR,Just want to run this scenario by you all and get some unbiased opinions if I can.Out on Disability for 15+ months total now, very sick.Went back to work in month 7, left after 5 days to get back on disability because my condition got worse againGot called in for a disciplinary hearing in month 12Boss says I'm being written up for failure to call in to the office each morning to inform my team lead that I will not be coming in, and for not providing Dr's notes when asked. Require me to come into the office for a formal disciplinary hearing even though I am still sick. 4 bosses and HR rep present.I say that I am on disability and didn't realize there was any expectation for me to be calling in each morning to tell the leads that I'm still sick and not coming in. I assumed my disability status had been factored in to the schedule, as management should be well aware of what is going on with me at this point. Also state that I have provided Dr's notes every time I have been asked, and this is all documented via email.Boss says they haven't seen anything to show that I'm on disability since the first time I came back to work. They do not respond regarding the Dr's notes.I insist that I am on disability, boss is unwilling to take my word. Is adamant that I sign disciplinary document.Document says I have not been giving Dr's notes, and that I have not been calling in when it is required of me. Boss says signing document is just acknowledgement of receiving it.I sign document acknowledging I have received it, go home and review my emails.I email my bosses, providing dates that I've sent all requested Dr's notes, and ask that I would like the disciplinary document rescinded or at the very least amended as it is not accurate according to documented actions I have taken.Bosses do not respond for 3 months, I am still sick and on disability. I ask my disability claim manager to reach out to HR, they say they have sent over proof that I am and have been on disability.Boss calls me a few weeks ago, asks for a new Dr's note and if I have a return to work date yet. I say I do not know when I will be better, but I will get the note.Email to provide new Dr's note, ask if they have heard back from disability claim people, or if they read my previous email outlining the errors in the disciplinary document and request for correction. No response."

[NY] help/advice. would this be a violation of NLRB rights?,"Sorry for the long essay that's about to follow. I recently received a text msg from my Director and was wondering if this is against our right. I personally did not receive it, but it was sent to multiple group chats in my field (site locations basically). Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. The follow are word for word of what was messaged with names erased.""Salary Adjustments For those who know me well, know that I‚Äôm well guarded with what I say‚Ä¶ I rarely speak out in anger or frustration‚Ä¶ so before I start I‚Äôm going to apologize to the majority of you Before i start, 20+ years ago I got ‚Äúinto it‚Äù with some docs and I almost wanted to quit‚Ä¶ instead I decided to come back with a smile‚Ä¶ and I told myself that the day someone at work can take the smile away from me would be the day I walk away‚Ä¶ 5 times in my career at _____ I‚Äôve raised my voice to yell ‚Ä¶ this time I‚Äôm too exhausted‚Ä¶ and I realize that I‚Äôm Not Angry.. I Am Frustrated I Am Disappointed and I‚Äôm more more disappointed than frustrated! I don‚Äôt understand this need to discuss your salary with your co-workers! The ______ tells us that we are Not to discuss our salaries!! I‚Äôve asked several times to NOT discuss your salaries. I‚Äôve been management for 18+ years and NOT once all in those years have I found someone getting more money because they talked amongst themselves. The Only Thing That Happens When You Decide To Talk Is That Someone Will Be Unhappy!!! I spoke to a Manager (not even one of us) and asked him‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIf I told you that you were getting at least a $3000 raise today to do the exact same job as yesterday how would you feel?‚Äù He said very happy. Then I asked him, ‚Äúif you found out that your peer got $4k, how would you feel?‚Äù He said he would be happy for the other person. But he could see some people feeling unhappy because they might feel less happy or appreciated. So then I said, ‚Äúso if that other person got $3 or $2999 then it would be ok?‚Äù ‚ÄúSo they would be happy if I could take money away from the other person?!?‚Äù When _____ got promoted to Director (same title as mine) I had hoped they give him more money than I made. When ______ got promoted to Director and he asked me what should he negotiate for? I told him a dollar amount higher than I make. I don‚Äôt know how much either are making‚Ä¶ but if they got more than me or one day make more than me, I‚Äôd be Super Happy for them. This was Not a merit increase. This was not a cost of living increase. This was a market adjustment based on years of experience in your current modality‚Ä¶ Plain‚Ä¶ And‚Ä¶ Simple Every tech got an increase‚Ä¶ the increases were smaller for people who have been in the field longer and make more money.. that‚Äôs what the market surveyed show. The last 3 job market adjustments only increased the starting salary‚Ä¶ this one everyone got something. The proper answer if someone ask you your salary is, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about that‚Äù. If you wanted be a little more street the answer would be, ‚Äúnone of your business!‚Äù In 20+ years, never thought that it would be ‚Äúmy‚Äù own techs that have come the closet to taking the smile off my face. So I‚Äôm Done. I‚Äôve officially given up on asking you all to NOT speak about your salaries. I now understand that I can‚Äôt control that. What I can control is future promotions. Going forward, if I hear of anyone discussing their salaries, they will have to wait until after I retire and hope _____ is more forgiving than I will be. I am still looking at the salaries. I‚Äôm still trying to understand the steps. When I have all the answers I will share them. If I see that anyone is not getting what they should I will fight to correct It. And I plan to put this salary adjustment in the rear view mirror. God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I can not change The courage to change the things I can And the wisdom to know the difference P.S. for those of you that were truly happy for your increase and did not speak about your salary, I apologize for subjecting you to this long long message.

[NH] FMLA for Medical Procedure,"I need to take 2 hrs off 5 days a week for a month for a medical procedure approved by a physician.I am indirect and am willing to make up the time on the same day.But it will prevent me from attending meetings during these hours.Does FMLA cover this?Assume FMLA covers this.  If they say....ah no problem you have flex time..no need for FMLA, should I insist on FMLA because of the legal protection? Missing these meetings is a threat to how well I can do my job.My company has a policy of unlimited paid time off subject to managers approval (for vacation). If the condition is not alleviated after a month there is a chance I will have to be out of office 2 days a week  for the other medical  treatment for the condition. I cannot make up this time.My understanding is that I have to use vacation time for fmla. Is there any reason why I would not be compensated?"
[CAN] explaining termination without cause and no supervisor reference,"I was recently terminated without cause, it was performance related regarding a rough patch from the last few months with the transition from manual to automated processes in a new system (other than the rough patch, led my peers in KPI's, was converted from a temporary to permanent employee,  positive yearly review, commodations from clients). Overall, was not a great fit and I certainly take responsibility but I also felt my supervisor didn't understand the challenges I faced in these months (no experience with my client group or its history, and least tech saavy person I've ever met)Anyways, Ive never been in this position before and have an interview coming up. From what I read from previous threads, its best to keep the details short (explain I was let go without cause and was not the best fit for me because of xyz responsibilitties, but this new position is a good fit because of abc responsibilities). I have supervisor references from my previous positions but how would I explain not having a supervisor reference from my most recent position if asked? Should I tell them upfront it wasn't the best fit with the supervisor when asked why I left? or hope they don't ask and explain if they do?While I'm sure the rough patch was the main factor, I think other factors were upcoming budget decreases that would result in less work and the new system being more self service.TIA"

[WY] [CA] ADA accomodations aren't respected?,"I have neurological and psychiatric disabilities and formally applied for ADA accomodations. I work remotely out of WY for a CA based company of less than 250 people. One of the accomodations is uninterrupted work time, as distractions can derail me and it's very difficult to get back on track.I have been notified that I need to attend meetings every afternoon for 1.5 hours (they are usually 2-2.5 hours), in addition to 2 hour meetings in the mornings. These meetings are mostly unstructured, AKA there's no set agenda. I don't see the point in attending them if Im not participating (and I'm not experienced enough to bring in clients), and just being in the meeting distracts me because of the talking and needing to listen in case Im called on. The reason to attend: so that the CEO can ""see"" me working. That's it. My performance is not in question, and Im afraid that so many hours in meetings will hinder my performance in the near future.In addition, I feel extremely guilty for leaving before everyone. I dont know how to bring it up other than being direct and announcing that I have accomodations in place. I dont think I should have to do this, but I feel very embarrassed and guilty for leaving meetings first every day. Advice?HR isn't very helpful and Im afraid of losing my job. I know that I have a case if I do get fired, but I want to avoid that. Leaving the company is not an option right now, and Im trying to ""suck it up"" as best as I can. I love my job, and I want to continue to excel at it."

I‚Äôve applied to about 50 roles, nearly half of them rejected me right away, the other half did not respond. I‚Äôve done 1 video screening interview and 1 video assessment, both looked like an automated step in their screening process. Anyway, never heard back from either. I always include a thoughtful cover letter tailored to the role I‚Äôm applying to. I have very good experience, I know I could be biased but my peers, ex-coworkers, people who‚Äôs worked with me are shocked that I‚Äôm not even getting an interview. Idk what to do at this point, I‚Äôm at a loss. I think I‚Äôll rewrite my resume, maybe it doesn‚Äôt have enough buzz words. (I hate buzz words when Im recruiting, so I kept my resume strictly to what I did. Maybe that‚Äôs come back to bite me.)For all the recruiters and HR who can share some advice for a job seeker: do I keep writing cover letters? Do I include my headshot on my resume? What do you look for in an HR manager or business partner? Is there something I should highlight in my resume? Thank you for any advice you‚Äôre willing to share!"
[IL] Reporting two cases of sexual harassment,"I (26F) work for a large tech company in a technical, customer facing role. I got a new manager on July 1 (40s F) who has constantly made comments on my appearance. It started with her just telling how beautiful of a face I have, but has progressed to about a month ago when she told me she sees my face in her dreams because I am so beautiful. These comments make me uncomfortable, and I've told her twice that I didn't appreciate the comments. They do seem to have somewhat slowed down, but I wouldn't say completely. Last week, I was traveling to visit a customer out of the country. While there, I decided to meet up for dinner with another customer who I have been working with for several months (virtually). We exchanged numbers on whatsapp, and he was disappointed when I invited him to dinner with everyone (meaning the 3 coworkers I traveled with) instead of alone. He accepted the invite ""under the condition him and I could still vet tea/coffee/drink afterwards, just the two of us, assuming I didn't have too many glasses of wine at dinner"" (quote from him text). I replied ""haha deal"" but it did make me uncomfortable. When we met for dinner, he immediately hugged me. He told my coworkers that he was not married, constantly told me how pretty I am, asked me to ditch my coworkers afterwards to hang out with him alone and go for a walk in a quiet part of town, and encouraged me to keep drinking more alcohol. My coworkers picked up on the situation, and made excuses for me as to why I couldn't stay with him and had to leave with them. Upon returning, I told my other coworker (who did not travel with us) about what had happened since he was working on this account with me. He was disgusted, told me that this customer was married with a 6 month old child, and that he wasn't going to continue working with him either. He talked to his manager (who is my managers peer) about it and asked what to do. They asked why I didn't report this to my own manager and I told them that I think she sexually harasses me too. I didn't really mean to say it, as I didn't want to tell anyone, but I was very distraught. My second line manager ended up emailing HR about both scenarios and I have an employee relations manager and investigator assigned to my case(s).My questions are:What does the Employee Relations Manager do?Are my managers actions sexual harassment?How does the investigation work if she has only said these things in my 1:1s with no witnesses?Is there anything I should be prepared for before meeting the investigator?What happens if I cry during the investigation? Silly question I know, but I worry about my own triggers.I appreciate the input in advance! I haven't been sleeping as I'm nervous to be fired, and this whole situation has made me feel so disgusting. Hoping it will all be done soon!"
[IN] Should this be reported to HR?,"Today my colleague came to me upset and offended because our boss asked her to take his place on the Black History Month planning committee.

She‚Äôs also the only person of color in our office. Her job duties include paying invoices, managing the budgets, ordering supplies, reserving rooms, etc.  This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs put her in charge of representing our office at minority events. Earlier in the semester he had her represent our office with a table at the African American Welcome Back Picnic. He told her that he though she would enjoy it. He made a similar comment to her today. I work in higher education at a university that has provided us with extensive diversity training. I‚Äôve encouraged my colleague to report him to HR but she is reluctant and worried about retaliation. What are your thoughts?"

[IL] How long should it take the company to send an offer letter after verbal?,"I was introduced to this job through a recruiter, and finished my interview with the company. I never directly communicate with the company except the time I had my interview with the people fr the company, and the recruiter is the middleman. The recruiter told me that the company is working on an offer letter and it would take the HR a few more days to get all the internal approvals and stuff before sending me the letter. The company have already asked me my salary expectation and ideal start date. I learned that they‚Äôre working on the letter a few days ago but I haven‚Äôt gotten it yet. How long does it take the company to prepare and send an offer letter after verbal? Is it safe to assume that I‚Äôm for sure getting the letter?

[CAN-BC] What should I do about a coworker who blew up in front of customers,"For some context, I made a mistake. I work at a place that serves drinks, and we are close to one of our ingredient suppliers. I'm fairly new at the company so when I was asked to grab said ingredient I did it so I could learn how to do it in the future. Unfortunately, I unknowingly bought the wrong type of ingredient (milk). The following day, said coworker (coworker, not manager or any superiority) came in and saw the wrong type of milk. I told her it was me and I didn't know because no one told me we needed a specific kind. Over the next few minutes she brought it up again and again, saying 'I shouldn't go if I don't know how', etc. At one point she rudely brought it up to me while I was on till taking an order from a customer. I had to answer her while still trying to maintain professional with the customer. The customer then said ""Well that's awkward..."" And seemed visibly uncomfortable. She then proceeded to tell another customer how ""...this lady is giving an employee trouble in front of everyone and it's really uncomfortable"".I'm not really sure how to handle the situation since I haven't been working for very long. I don't know if I should bring it up to my manager or not, since this situation reflects poorly on the company from the customers perspective. Also, this is an employee known amongst the employees for starting problems with other coworkers. She acts like an angel in front of our managers and they don't think she is a problem at all. Should I tell them about this?"

[TX] Employee Safety,"If employees constantly report to their employer that their cars are broken into, harassed by homeless people, etc., while on company property, is there something the employer has to do?An employer (which is a large employer) frequently sends emails guiding their employees to walk in pairs, call the non-emergency line, call HR or the police if they feel unsafe in the parking lot but states ""they're just as safe here as they are at home,"" and is unwilling to take any further action.Is this correct?

Pseudo demotion (not performance related) - ask for severance? [CA],"This is a question for my sister, that I provided her advice on, to check if my advice is totally off the wall or if askHr agrees.She has been at her current company for just over 3 years. She went out on a medical leave, earlier this year but has been back at work for several months. She had positive to neutral performance reviews prior and no feedback since returning. All of a sudden her boss told her they are hiring a new role above her to basically do the strategic parts of her current job. She is keeping her director title and pay but will be working on the more day to day operational pieces. Her issue is that she liked the strategic parts better, and feels the day to day operational is more mundane and typically a lower level position.She has had multiple discussions with her boss trying to understand rationale but is just told that it‚Äôs not performance related, and job responsibilities can change at any time. It sounds fishy to me that this was after her medical leave.She‚Äôs ready to jump ship as a result but I think she should first talk to her boss again, share that it feels like a significant part of her job was taken away as discrimination for the medical leave, and ask if they‚Äôd consider a severance. (Ie making them think she‚Äôd file suit otherwise)She thinks I‚Äôm crazy, that she has no ground since her position and pay didn‚Äôt change. Is that really the bar?Update- thanks for your responses.

[CA] My employer has done a reduction in force and is trying to keep my PTO! Help!,"The past few months I have known my company was going to do a reduction and it was a big chance I would be impacted. I have been preparing for this and saw there was an opportunity within the company but I would have to relocate to Texas if I accepted the offer. I did not accept the offer, due to the salary. Since then I have been interviewing with several companies in different states and have leaned toward Texas, since my son currently lives there. I have used his address on my applications and when asked where they can ship my end of employment papers, I provided that address as well. My company took this as me moving to Texas and now refuses to pay me my unused paid time off. They said Texas doesn‚Äôt require them to pay me my PTO, but I‚Äôm not a Texas resident.

[CA] Is being treated differently than others enough for a grievance?,"I work for a local public agency in California. A new supervisor has been applying a different set of rules to me regarding time-off, requiring doctors notes for certain things, etc. Any one of these instances doesn't seem like a big deal, but I think I can make an argument that he has out for me with how he capriciously applies different sets of rules towards me. What should I do?I'll give an example of one instance... multiple people have had covid and I recently had it. My supervisor has been demanding I get a doctor's note for the time spent away even though I provided him with a positive test from the County's public health. No other covid positive employee has had to provide a doctor's note.Another would be denying a leave request with only a few days notice when he granted another employee a leave request under the same exact circumstances.In the morning, a few of the guys from other departments have coffee for about an hour in the morning. I joined in a couple times in a week and he singled me out with some rude comments about not attending. (It is away from my work site, but I had a legitimate reason to be there).Any ideas?"
[CAN] My supervisor from a previous company does not want to provide a reference. What should I do?,"I just interviewed with Company A and they‚Äôve asked for my references. One of them needs to be a direct supervisor from a previous employer. I‚Äôve contacted my old supervisor, who is now in upper management with Company B, Company A‚Äôs direct competitor. He stated that he does not want to help Company A get a good candidate, and wants me to interview with Company B instead. I don‚Äôt want to work for Company B.What should I do?If it matters, Company A is using a third party to conduct the reference check.Thanks!"

[UK] Can my manager fire me for only being available 2 days on an 8 hour contract?,"I have a part time job at subway, however my hours each week aren‚Äôt reliable as some weeks i‚Äôll do 30+ hours and then other weeks i‚Äôll do 10 hours, whilst the job is okay because it‚Äôs a small subway with only 9 people working there, all women, sometimes it can get quite hostile and bitchy, So i‚Äôve applied for a new job where i am contracted 30 hours a week with a higher wage. The benefits of working at subway is that it‚Äôs close to home (5 min drive) and i mainly work close shifts where it‚Äôs just 2/3 people (i like all the closing staff not the morning/day) With my new job i am still available to work 2 days a week and i could do with the extra money so i told my manager this but she said she cannot keep me on if i can only work 15 hours a week, even though my contract is only for 8 hours a week yet there are two people who only work one day a week (8 hours) The thing is i don‚Äôt want to fully leave subway as i actually like the ppl i work with but i cannot afford to stay on and i genuinely do not think i could do morning shifts (5:30am -3pm) where it would just be me and one other person until 11am and again i do not really like the morning staff. Legally can my manager fire me for not being available more than 14 hours?"

"[CA] Disciplinary write up, boss is out of pocket??","Asking for a friend.My friend is a Leasing Manager at an apartment complex, they're in charge of outreach, oversight of leases old and new, event planning, and some management. My friend reports to a General Manager who was hired there about two weeks prior to my friend -- the LM. This GM employs an all around annoying, moody, haughty, yet aloof management style. (A new employee nicknamed GM Cruella) Since the beginning of my friend's tenure there, it has been discovered through encounters at work that GM goes through these moods that have a tendency to disrupt the otherwise pleasant and peaceful work environment. GMs passive aggressive behavior and fake attitude even caused a former maintenance man to quit.GM pretends to care about creating a positive and cohesive work environment but is not responsive to requests for assistance, is never particularly helpful when approached for help, and has a tendency to act like a bully to LM and others for asking constructive questions. Once LM tried to reach out to a different department for help which GM encouraged previously and consequently scolded LM for requesting help. Other employees have brought issues of  'moods' and hypocrisy up to GM directly only for GM to disregard, act confused, or attribute the mood to their having RBF. (We suspect The GM being prescribed benzodiazepine drugs could have a role to play)LM started their job with an excited attitude and worked to improve the work environment and culture there because it suffered from some pretty heavy disorganization before their employment started. This excited motivation eventually devolved into a frustrated and tired attitude which can fluctuate as often as the moods of the GM apparently do. LM does their best to tune out the negativity but the morale of the staff suffers due to the unpleasant vibe GM carries around and it has gotten to the point where majority of the staff besides one that attaches themselves closely to the GM can agree the environment has become a real drag because of GM. Despite the sour work environment the disorder from before was changed greatly and there's now a healthy number of residents being catered to at the complex. LM has played a significant role in improving said work environment. LM and GM have clashed in the past due to claims from GM that LM has not performed up to par in the past but the claims are bordering on nitpicking at this point.Today GM put together a disciplinary write up for LM and invited a Regional Director to the meeting to discuss improving LMs 'unsatisfactory performance' and it is written on the basis of maybe 1 half true complaint out of 10 at best: -Goals that were never clearly established because of a lack of communication from GM to LM -GM claimed to have to remind LM of a task twice when in fact GM reminded LM once (a week later) -GM complains of not being notified of a certain payment protocol LM authorized -GM claims there is excessive ""hanging out"" in the office, when there is no shortage of GM chatting it up with their favorite employee during sidekicks entire shift regularly -Even more ridiculous claims that aren't even worth typing outSome of GMs proposed solutions include LM adopting ambiguous practices that suit GM better personally and LM and myself find are actually unnecessary, others set goals that seem to be regressive in nature and others provide LM do things they are already doing. LM refused to sign the write up and told GM & RD that some of these claims are certainly not based in fact."

[VA] How would you react to audio recordings submitted for harassment allegations.,"Hi HR pros!My SIL is currently experiencing harassment in the workplace. She was warned when hired that her boss was ‚Äòeccentric‚Äô and ‚Äòdifficult‚Äô. His harassment has escalated and I‚Äôm concerned.She employed in VA, which is a single party consent state for recording conversations. It appears as long as she is in a public space and records, she is in compliance with the law.Her boss has 15 years tenure as a scientist (i.e. difficult to replace) at this company, while she has only been employed for 3 months (also a scientist, but far less experienced). I believe HRs warning about her boss indicates they understand he is potentially abusive and are not inclined to step in.Rather than initiating a ‚Äòhe said/she said‚Äô accusation, I am wondering if recording a few conversations for evidence would be in her best interest? Will HR consider this as evidence? Is it worth it? She loves her work and wants to stay.Any advice you can give us greatly appreciated! Thank you so much! I‚Äôm totally lost here!EDIT: I am planning on speaking to a friend who is an employment attorney to confirm the boss‚Äôs behavior meets legal definitions of harassment in VA.

"[CA] HELP! Sexual relationships, male favoritism, dismissed concerns!","I have had several of my employees come to me with allegations against a male supervisor.He's having sexual relationships with at least 3 people that have been named and the reporters have alluded to more.He tells sexually explicit jokes and makes innuendos toward female workers.He has no work boundaries and often is buddy buddy with the other males.There have been issues with work morale, time and attendance, behavior at work, and other concerning circumstances. I am not the store manager and this co-worker and I are on the same level. I have sent HR several documentation about this coworker concerning alarming behavior. My intuition and observations have been spot on. I have constant problems with him BUT he makes a point to not act on any of these behaviors around me.Less than a year ago I filed an HR report in good faith against another male coworker who was a supervisor who was carrying a concealed knife on him and was a harassing our new female staff for dates. He made off putting remarks about their safety and made them really uncomfortable. I had several staff members tell me there experiences with this person. When I brought my concerns to HR it took a long time to be addressed and he ended up transferring to another state. He ended up doing the same behavior and the consequences were much more serve for the woman involved, the company, and himself. When I finally had a conversation with HR several months later it was founded that it was ""general perviness"" but nothing was ever founded. HR even went a step further saying ‚Äúit seemed like they were trying to ruin his reputation and the original reporter (a male) was putting stories in the girl's head) The girls told me they felt bamboozled and that HR did not take is seriously.I need help please!!!!

Also I was supposed to be provided with a contract and background check on my first day which I never received. My boss was terrible she questioned everything I did and only brought up all my mistakes I was making. I advocated for myself requesting more training time and tried to explain I didn‚Äôt know I was making mistakes because of the lack of onboarding. Some days I worked without a lunch during a 8 hr shift. I was given no onboarding or training with the school but was expected to know everything. I am so saddened by the situation. I have mental health disabilities that I feel like contributed to my demeanor being questionable. I still don‚Äôt know what exactly about my demeanor was wrong. I wore scrubs. My personality is direct and client centered.I was an OTA working with kids with autism. Most of my time was spent was with the kids. I didn‚Äôt have enough time to interact with any teachers. So I don‚Äôt know exactly what was said.Also the day of my termination I asked when I would receive my first/last check. Boss said the next day through direct deposit. Never received sent an email and boss said she would mail it out. Two weeks later no check. I went into the school to speak with boss. She had the check sitting on her desk. I don‚Äôt know if the amount is correct or if taxes where taken out. She did not want to talk to me and was very short.

[NC] HR needing HR advice‚Ä¶,I am an HR team of one at our organization. I have chronic fatigue syndrome as well as an autoimmune disease that does require me to call out more than I‚Äôd like (say 1-2 times every couple months) and makes it hard to stick to a strict 9-5 schedule. Our previous CEO had no issues with being flexible in this because I always got my work done with no issues.My new boss is not as understanding and I feel like he may be taking corrective action (to what degree I don‚Äôt know) but I want to make sure I am protecting myself.

[CO] I‚Äôm being told by my employer that I can‚Äôt use my accrued 24 hours of paid sick time because I didn‚Äôt request to use the paid hours 120 hours in advance. Is this legal?,"I woke up sick yesterday morning, immediately called off because I had COVID like symptoms. I scheduled an urgent care appointment and it was determined that I don‚Äôt have COVID (but i am contagious for several days with a different illness) so I acquired a doctors note as proof.As soon as I got back home from my appointment, I scheduled the next two days off with my paid ‚Äúsick time‚Äù.  Immediately a notification popped up saying this: ‚ÄúThis was an emergency request since it was within 120 hours of your scheduled work date and time. You will receive an Unexcused absence unless you provide appropriate documentation‚Äù.I then contacted my employer to clarify. I asked them if they needed my note from the doctor to excuse my unexcused absences to which I was told: ‚ÄúWe don't take doctor's notes so I will have to find that email template and audit it!‚Äù.  I was then told I need to delete the ‚Äúsick‚Äù request and resubmit it as regular ‚Äútime off‚Äù since it‚Äôs an unexcused absence.So now all three days I‚Äôm missing are going to be unexcused just because they don‚Äôt take drs notes apparently. This led me to ask: ‚ÄúSo if i‚Äôm sick again in the future, it‚Äôs going to unexcused unless i request off paid sick time five days in advance?‚Äù to which my employer simply replied ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.How is anyone suppose to know they‚Äôre going to be sick five days before they‚Äôre sick? So I‚Äôm just going to get unexcused absences every time i suddenly get sick? This doesn‚Äôt seem right at all and I desperately need to get paid the three days I‚Äôm missing."
Benefits After Quitting [NV],"I  was at a job from early July to late August. I was on a probationary  period that would not end until October.  Any benefits I wanted would  not kick in until that time. For a number of reasons, I quit in August  and thought that was the end of it.In  October, I started getting all kind of correspondence from the  employers health insurance company. I reached out to HR to ask why and  they said they'd look into it. I never heard back. In November I  received a welcome letter from a doctor. Apparently, I hadn't picked a  provider so they picked one for me. But I didn't pick one because I had  no idea I had coverage. At the same time I started getting letters that  since my employment benefits have run out, I qualify for Cobra. But I  never had benefits for them to run out.I  reached out to HR again and was told that since my term was processed  in October, I had benefits for that month. I asked what that meant and  was never given an answer. I keep asking to help me understand why I had  coverage in October for benefits I wasn't eligible for until after my  probation, if I left in the middle of my probation. HR will not answer  this question. They just dance around it.Can  someone here explain to me how it works. I just want to understand how  my benefits kicked in when I never completed my probationary period."

"[IA] coworker was caught taking a video of me (from behind, from a distance, without my knowledge). the video practically shows nothing except my butt. is this a fireable offense?","I work in manufacturing and I (21F) am the only woman we have working in the shop. As far as I know, I am the first woman to do so ever. A few days ago, a supervisor noticed my coworker (60M) was recording me. Once I turned around and saw what he was doing, he stopped the video. His explanation was that he was taking a video so that I could show my mom what I do at work. You can barely see what I am working on, the video was filmed from about 25 feet away, zoomed in. He does not know my mom and I did not indicate that I wanted to show her my work. My dad (who is another supervisor here) happened to walk by, and the man filming me said he would text the video to my dad so he could ‚Äúshow my mom‚Äù. I was weirded out but was busy and my dad didn‚Äôt open the text, so I didn‚Äôt watch video until after work. Coworker claimed to have deleted the video after this. Once I saw the video, I reported it and forwarded it to my boss. The last two days, coworker has been on paid leave pending investigation.

[MA] Need advice: how do I avoid being terminated for my health issues?,"Hi everyone - I am new to Reddit so apologies if I‚Äôm doing this wrong, but I could really use some unbiased advice about the situation I‚Äôm in. This is going to be a long one, but please stay with me!I currently live in the US and work remotely for a large, Fortune 100 tech company. I‚Äôm in an inside sales position and have been in the role for a little over a year. Now I‚Äôm going to get pretty personal‚Ä¶I have been struggling with endometriosis for most of my adult life (I‚Äôm 25). I have been managing my symptoms with medication, and it‚Äôs mostly been fine. I  always have pain for a few days each month but rarely (if ever) to the point of it impacting my work. However, at the beginning of this year, that changed.I had to switch my medication due to another health complication, and the new medication I‚Äôm on isn‚Äôt working. My endometriosis pain has worsened significantly over the course of the year. The last 3 months, in particular, have been an absolute battle for me.I am in debilitating pain for nearly 2 weeks each month, and I‚Äôve had to take days off from work due to being unable to even stand. I‚Äôve had to be physically carried to and from the bathroom, have had mood and sleep issues, and have experienced severe dizziness and vomiting from the pain. I only mention this to emphasize that when my time of the month comes, it‚Äôs quite literally unbearable.That being said - I have obviously been on an aggressive search for a new treatment plan and have been seeing many doctors. Due to the nature of this condition, I‚Äôve needed to get several opinions, and it‚Äôs looking like surgery is my only option. All of these appointments have also caused me to miss work (and I will be missing more in the future for the surgery). So not only has this been taking a toll on me mentally and physically, it‚Äôs taking a toll on my work performance as well.I am worried, given that sales is a very results-driven and numbers-driven field. For the past two months, my performance has dipped due to my health issues. Reports have come out from our operations team that are showing a decline in my metrics, and my manager finally asked me about it today. I gave a generic excuse. I know I probably should‚Äôve discussed what‚Äôs been going on much sooner before ever letting it get to this point, but here‚Äôs the problem: I‚Äôm the only female on an all-male team, with a male boss.Our entire team of 10 people consists of men in their 30‚Äôs-40‚Äôs, and I just haven‚Äôt felt comfortable having this deeply personal conversation with my manager. Looking back, I wish I had just been more mature about it and been honest, because having the conversation now will only look like an excuse. I haven‚Äôt reached out to HR yet either because I don‚Äôt want to step on my managers toes or go behind his back. I‚Äôm not even sure how that whole process works or if that‚Äôs even the right thing to do here.I really love this job, the company, and my team, but I feel like I‚Äôm on thin ice (and if not yet, I will be soon). With the recession, my company has been laying people off and there has overall been stricter oversight and higher expectations from the sales organization. The timing of all of this just couldn‚Äôt be worse.I would really appreciate any advice anyone can offer on how I should proceed and what kinds of rights I might have as an employee. I am hoping I can still get out ahead of this if it‚Äôs not too late. I should add that I‚Äôm normally the type of employee to go above and beyond - even working late and on holidays if need be. With the exception of these recent health issues, I rarely take time off (and even when I do, I make sure I can still be reached by my coworkers). I truly want to make things right and keep this job, even if it means having a somewhat-awkward conversation."
[CA] I transferred teams this year. Can my current manager likely see my past performance reviews by default?,
[FRANCE] Can an employees inability to take part in social situations be officially be used against them?,"I am an Autistic mid-career level manager at a startup company. HR and management are not aware of my neurodiversity since per local regulations, I am not required to disclose it unless it directly impacts my objective job performance, which it doesn‚Äôt.My role requires that I travel with other team members to attend events, seminars and conferences, among other duties. I have no trouble whatsoever carrying out professional duties expected of someone in my role - I go above and beyond to offer the best possible service and generally obtain positive feedback.During these industry events and travels, however, employees are expected to stick together and participate in all kinds of social events that while not mandatory by any means, appear to be an important part of company and industry culture; like lunch together, dinner together, drinks together, etc. Since local culture puts strong emphasis on personal connections, such events open doors and might act as the primary building blocks of your reputation as a professional (which sometimes outweighs your actual performance on the job - eg. personality can trump skill and output).Largely due to my ASD, I cannot take part in such events, as much as I would like to. I simply have no energy left at the end of a long day at an industry show to do any more socialising off-the-clock, my social fuel being absolutely dry after 8 hours of on-the-clock talking to potential clients. I have tried in the past, but the result was either terrible migraines, skin rashes or a stomach ulcer. (So please, don‚Äôt tell me to make an effort sometimes - every day is already a huge effort as is)So I politely but consistently turn down social invitations from co-workers for after work anything. I thank them for thinking of me, but explain that I‚Äôm very tired and need to go to the hotel and rest. This has caused my team to treat me different, and I know there is gossip and speculation about my personality and lifestyle. I don‚Äôt know how to navigate this in a professional manner that is honest, but doesn‚Äôt require me to expose my neuro diversity to those who might not understand. I also fear for my future and career options - whether I am eligible for a promotion, a raise, or even if I can be trusted as someone who acts different from the norm.Is there any advice HR could offer?"
[MI]/[IN] Time clock rounding violation?,"My coworkers and I have been noticing an average of 5-10 minutes being stolen from our clock time almost every day due to time clock rounding. I went back a year of my timesheets alone and ran the math. I only lost out on about 5 hours of time overall, but my co workers are losing on average, an hour a pay period (bi weekly). 76% of the time it works to benefits my employer, the rate seems to be higher for my co workers, who work more hours than me. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs in violation of labor laws, but I‚Äôm not sure where to go next with this.One thing that I can‚Äôt seem to find an answer for is why our employer would use a different time rounding amount in the morning for clock in, than in the afternoon. We have a 10 minute rounding in the morning, but 6 minutes in the afternoon. It‚Äôs a bit over my head, but we want to know what we‚Äôre talking about if we take this to HR, this just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Any feedback is helpful. Michigan location, Indiana corporate office."
[PA] How many times is too many for a prospective employee to reach out via phone/email about the application process?,"Background: I was offered a position with an unsatisfactory salary this past Friday and, when I expressed this, the HR person who contacted me suggested I apply for a different position with higher pay (after checking with the program director to make sure I did qualify). She told me to put in an application over the weekend and said we would ‚Äúreconvene‚Äù on Monday. It is now Wednesday and I have not received a phone call or email, though I‚Äôve emailed twice and called once.I don‚Äôt plan to contact them again until maybe next week but I‚Äôm wondering if this is even worth it or advisable, or should I just assume something came up and wait to receive a call or email?"
[NY] Can I get fired for not responding to my boss while I‚Äôm on documented medical leave?,"I‚Äôm in an intensive outpatient mental health treatment program, in part due to work burnout. I have submitted documentation and the staff already  sent the FMLA paperwork to HR.My boss has contacted me multiple times while on leave for work related questions. This morning she texted me again asking to call her when I get a minute.My boss has an MO of doing this. When my grandpa died in January, she called me on the only day I took off for his funeral asking to fix my time card.This is adversely affecting my mental health while I‚Äôm still trying to get better. I don‚Äôt really have the capacity to be replying. Can i be fired if I don‚Äôt reply to her messages?"
[OH] can i collect unemployment and a severance benefit?,[OH] i was offered a 5k benefit and fired for performance reasons. it was 10000% wrongful termination im just feeling defeated if i can fight it because it‚Äôs so hard to prove discrimination based off microaggressions. HR keeps bugging me to sign it. I‚Äôm hesitant because idk if accepting this will affect my unemployment some way. i‚Äôm not trying to make it easy for them. there is a ‚Äúrelease of all claims‚Äù in the agreement - does this mean i can‚Äôt provide proof to unemployment that they wrongfully terminated me?? i just wanna know what the best thing is to do. i tried to negotiate the benefit and they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs non negotiable. should i just accept it and part ways or stick with the unemployment route
[CO] Approaching to topic of feeling unwelcome at work and inappropriate work conversation,"I started a new job three months ago. Love the job itself-it‚Äôs a role I‚Äôm very knowledgeable and passionate about. I would like to not quit especially because I haven‚Äôt been here long. However, the colleague interactions here have been wildly out of pocket.I have felt extremely unwelcome since the week I started. I have a coworker who will look me in my face while I speak to her, then turn her back to me and not respond. I have a coworker who compares me to another, telling me she‚Äôs done this and that better and I need to be more like her. I have been treated like an outcast by my own direct manager who will literally hear me say something and act uncomfortable, then when my coworker says the same thing act very interested and passionate about the topic. I‚Äôve gotten punished for doing the same exact thing my coworkers do while they‚Äôre reassured they can do it. I got written up for late attendance following an approved late day for taking my cat to the emergency vet.Past that, my manager and two of my coworkers have ACTIVELY spoken about inappropriate topics at work. My third week here they sat and spoke about kinky sex they‚Äôve had with their dates, and toys involved. My manager will talk poorly about women he‚Äôs dated. They talk about getting wasted together and openly talk about parties that ONLY I am not invited to, right in front of me. It is so uncomfortable.I have numbers nearly the highest within the branch and my manager will say I‚Äôm not doing enough or working hard enough. I‚Äôve gone to the bathroom on breaks to cry about the responses I receive when I‚Äôm literally just talking about normal stuff. I feel so isolated and uncomfortable but I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm the problem.I have a direct ops manager (the unprofessional one), a branch manager (who hasn‚Äôt been problematic), a sales manager above them and then a manager above everybody else within the branch (the latter two whom I never interact with). Our HR is entirely remote. Is this a situation that would require speaking to a higher up? If so, who do I go to first? My job is also completely capable of being a WFH job, would it be realistic to request doing that to avoid making my coworkers uncomfortable as I apparently am?"
[UK] Can employers ban hot food?,We have a microwave in the kitchen we aren‚Äôt allowed to heat food in. Because we have no break area outside of a corner of the office they‚Äôve said we can‚Äôt even bring in hot food now because it smells - same reason microwave use is banned even for lunch and dinner (we work late often) Is this allowed? I‚Äôm seeing conflicting things online that we have to have access to hot food but also only in break areas which we don‚Äôt have

[NY] inappropriate language,"if an employee writes an email complaining about coworkers and describes them as "" these incompetent, useless administrators"" would that be terminable?would it matter if its provable that they did make multiple mistakes?would it be considered vile language?edit: some more infoi was cced in this email chain so im just watching/reading in silence. i reread some of it. the employee who wrote the email is organizationally below the administrators (different department at different worksites).the manager of the administrators is arguing that the employee violated policy by use of ""vile, intemperate, abusive language."" would incompetent and useless be considered intemperate?employee is complaining they made a complaint regarding administrators conduct and only after that did this become an issue and is therefore retaliation as an eeo violation. is there any merit to that? eeo is only specific to if retaliation is related to a covered eeo category, right?edit: this is as much of the story as i have.employee is also a patient that receives treatment at this organization. employee does have intermittent fmla for his conditions. he made several complaints regarding administrators mistakes over the phone to a patient advocate. administrators said it was a miscommunication error and a misunderstanding. employee says he has a recording where they admit it was actually their mistake (i havent heard it).  employee sent email after claiming issues were ignored over the phone (seems to have been several phone call complaints to the patient advocate followed by 1 email complaint)."
[AR] medical privacy violation? Help me help a coworker,"I don‚Äôt want to make this too long so essentially; my coworker works in Arkansas (we work for same company, different states). They were told today that they needed to provide proof that they need to see their therapist weekly, they use their lunch break to go now and got in trouble for not using time from their pto instead? I‚Äôm not sure what their problem is all of the sudden. Our work gets done every day, and it‚Äôs just two of us assisting a team of 15+ people. Can our job force them to prove that this is medically necessary? Adding to but unrelated: our boss also doesn‚Äôt call them by their correct pronouns and specifically goes hard in emails to teammates with the wrong pronouns in the email about said coworker. If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you."
[AU] Should I attend an interview for a position I have no intention of accepting if offered?,"I have an upcoming interview for a position in a field I'm really interested in pursuing in the future. However  the role is a six month contract beginning in January, and I'm currently 3.5 months pregnant, meaning I won't be able to accept if offered the position. I'm thinking that attending the interview would still be a good opportunity to network and practice my interview skills for a similar position in the future. Is this ethical, or would I be wasting the interview panel/company's time? I don't intend to tell them I'm pregnant and unable to accept any offers."
[CAN-ON] Contacting Recruiter For Salary Negotiation Information,"I worked previously with a recruiter for another position in the same industry I'm in now. I'm happily in a role now but I'm trying to find information that is more relevant to my marketplace. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on reaching out to that recruiter to get their take on salary info?Nothing specific, obviously. But I figure if anyone has information on my industry, it would be them."
[WV] can I ask for a bonus?,"I am working for a smaller business where I am currently filling in for the office manager while she is on maternity leave. We are in West Virginia  and the business is an office based medication assisted treatment for opiate addiction. She has been out since the beginning of October, but even before that she was working a lot less and I had taken on a lot more responsibility. What I am asking is if it seems selfish of me to think I would receive compensation for that time. If I were to receive some, when would I receive it? Can I ask for it while the manager is still out on maternity leave? It is up in the air on when she will be back (possibly mid December/possibly after the new year) and it is also unknown if she will be part time when she comes back. I believe I will be keeping some of my new responsibilities even after she comes back. I've also been told by the providers that I've been doing a better job than the office manager and they appreciate me. I guess I need some guidance on this as I also don't want to be selfish."
[CA] Sick Pay Question,"Hello all,I'm a single mother and I tend to save my sick hours in the event I need to care for my son whenever he is sick. I'm currently down to having only 18 hours of sick pay and guess what.. I am sick. I usually still go to work but this time I have not been able to even get up from bed since yesterday, this is how bad I am.  Luckily these were my days off. It's so bad that I don't even know how I'm typing this, please excuse any typos. I've tested negative for covid so I can't use any of my  covid hours. My concern really is that I can't work tomorrow but I also can't afford to spend my sick time because I fear my son will be sick between the time of now till next June 2023, which is when I get another 40 hours of sick pay. I just started to think how unfair this is and am wondering if there are any loopholes. My kid doesn't usually get sick but when he does I'm the only who can care for him. Aside from having ADHD, he is a healthy boy.I'm afraid that if I call off tomorrow and use sick time, IF my kid gets sick in the future and I don't have enough sick hours, they will discipline any future call off to the point they'll terminate me. Why is this a concern of mine? Because I'm the hourly manager that presents associates with their termination notice due to their absences.I know i can ask my HR director but before heading to their office I want to have a better understanding of what I can ask for or at least what to expect. Thank you in advance!"
[CA] FMLA - Can employer deny it?,"Live in California. 6 months postpartum. I returned to work 4 weeks early so I can use the remainder of my FMLA in the holidays. State and HR states that I‚Äôm allowed to use 12 wks of FMLA in increments until my baby‚Äôs first bday.HR said all I have to do is submit a 30 day notice to my manager. I provided a 2 month notice. Last night, manager said my leave is bad timing since it‚Äôs busy and that I have a year to use it anyway.  Manager said they‚Äôre reaching out to labor relations regarding my situation.I don‚Äôt even know why this is a ‚Äúsituation‚Äù. I thought FMLA is my right and it‚Äôs protected like it can‚Äôt be denied.Anyone have their employer ‚Äúdeny‚Äù FMLA leave? Can I fight this?"
[CA] What are your standards for phone screenings?,"Obviously this is opinion base, and dependent on the field, but I am stressed.I had a phone screening on 11/11. It went‚Ä¶ okay. I might be over thinking. I rambled on one answer and sounded like an idiot. I talk kind of fast, and my voice was shaky. I don‚Äôt interview frequently because I don‚Äôt change jobs frequently. I‚Äôm almost 30 and this was literally only my 4th interview ever.The recruiter told me that they will be handing over the top candidates to the hiring manager this week and they want to have someone in the role by January. They told me the salary expectation and confirmed when I would be available to start but is that a good sign or standard practice? They also asked me to send over any extra documents I have that reaffirm my qualifications. I did this right after we spoke and said thank you for their time and also apologized for my rambling‚Ä¶ which now I‚Äôm wondering if that was a dumb thing to apologize for.In terms of check boxes, I check most of them for the job but again, I feel like I didn‚Äôt express myself as professionally as I am. I do SO much better talking in person.My anxiety over this position is so bad because it literally is my dream job, and I mentioned that, and there‚Äôs no way to know the standards until I get the call or email saying I get to the next stage.Am I overthinking? Did I raise too many red flags?"
[CO] Background check question with First Advantage,"Hi everyone! I just accepted a job with a company out in Colorado and I have to do a background check through First Advantage. I am a little worried though, as I received a misdemeanor when I was 19. It was back in 2018, and even though it‚Äôs either sealed or expunged (I can‚Äôt remember what one it is), can First Advantage see that in the background check?They didn‚Äôt do my finger prints at all, and I have never had to do a background check before, as this is my first corporate job. Has anyone else had this experience before? They never asked me if I have committed a felony/misdemeanor before, so I didn‚Äôt lie on the job application!"
[CA]Drug test,My employer has a drug policy that states it screens for marijuana and alcohol. If you fail it can lead up to termination. If I pass the marijuana and alcohol test but other drugs were to be found in my system would they be able to terminate me?
[CA] Misleading Compensation Package/Offer Letters at a Small Company,"Using a throwaway/alt for obvious reasons.Background:I was recently promoted to manage a key team at a small agency based in southern California, approx 30 employees across the US, Canada, Mexico, and Europe.One of the two founding partners handles all things finance and accounting, and he is notoriously greedy, shady, and a nightmare to deal with. Until recently, he was also our ""HR"" person until several of us pointed out this is an egregious conflict of interest. After that conversation, the partners hired a ""part time HR consultant"" who is currently tasked with correcting our employee handbook and evaluating our benefits package, but no one has been introduced to her.Issue:One of my direct reports' 1-year ""work-iversary"" and Annual Review is coming up next week. Ahead of that conversation, she pulled me aside to express concerns that her hiring package and compensation structure was misleading and she doesn't know how to address it. As her (new) manager, I'm now responsible for discussions both with my DRs and with leadership concerning compensation.This is how it's written in her hiring package (fake numbers):Compensation:‚Ä¢ Annual Salary: $100,000‚Ä¢ Annual Performance Bonus: $10,000"
[AZ] Am I getting fired or is this a genuine opportunity to improve?,"I have been at this company for over a year now and am an employee, direct report to supervisor. For the first 10 months I was under a supervisor who no longer works for the company - he was very uninvolved with my career advancement and never checked in, but I could always sense that he wasn‚Äôt very fond of me. I now have a new supervisor, who I‚Äôve been under for about 2 months now, and things were going good to me knowledge. I had meetings with my new supervisor and asked if my performance was good and she stated no problems. I even had a meeting with my manager (for separate reason) and asked if there are any ways to improve my performance and she said she was pleased with my performance.The following day after meeting with my manager, I got called in to a meeting with my supervisor, manager, and HR. They presented a written warning to me, stating some mistakes I‚Äôve made while on the job (fair), but also several other minor issues that I was never aware were issues (like talking too much on bench, being on phone too much). They said that if these issues aren‚Äôt addressed within 30 days when we reevaluate and meet again, I could be fired. I was never aware that these issues were even a thing so I apologized and said I would be more mindful of these issues.Days later, my supervisor met with me again for a regular scheduled meeting and she apologized for the written warning meeting. She said that my manager was only involved because she is a newer supervisor and doesn‚Äôt know the process to written warnings. She also said that it was reassuring to see my surprised reaction to the stated problems because she said most of these issues were older and was just never addressed by my uninvolved, older supervisor and had to bring them up because they were documented. I expressed my willingness to change and do whatever for the company, and also expressed my fear of the company using this as a nice way to let me know I‚Äôm getting fired. She reassured me that it wasn‚Äôt the case.I need your help HR Reddit. I will go forward and do better on the complaints they listed, but I am curious how I should perceive the situation - I‚Äôm getting fired and they‚Äôre giving me a heads up, or this is genuinely a chance to do better of issues I wasn‚Äôt aware on.Also is there anything I can do during this period to protect myself and also do better performance wise?"
[IL] Wanting to leave a job soon due to work life balance.,"Hey all,Wanted to ask a general question since I am rethinking my employer choice at the moment.I work a lot of hours and do not enjoy my current work life balance in my engineering field. I have only worked at this company for 6months and am considering leaving soon.Should I try and actively start looking for jobs and leave as soon as I find one or stay up until a year and then leave?Just wanted some insight from HR perspective due to other employers probably wondering why I left so quickly. Also if you think I should leave ASAP, what‚Äôre some ways I can explain why I left early for work life balance instead of HR thinking I‚Äôm not a good employee."
[IN] When / how far in advance should I notify my company of my retirement?,"I [M54] work for a huge company in Indiana you would all recognize if I said it. I am eligible for official retirement when I turn 55 (small pension, healthcare coverage until 65, other small retiree perks), which I turn this coming year (late 2023, about a year from now).  With the current direction of the economy and my lack of trust of large corporations, my chances of getting caught up in a downsizing within the next year are higher than normal.  Additionally, I‚Äôve slightly ""quiet quit"" to the extent possible in a desk job. I just do the minimum needed to do a good job, but I‚Äôm not stepping up anymore to do extra, not coming in early or staying late like I used to, not offering to train new employees or volunteer for committees, etc.If I notify my company now of my intention to officially retire one year from now, what considerations are there I should keep in mind ?  Specific questions :Does being ""on notice"" for retirement make it less likely I‚Äôll be downsized (fear of lawsuit, age discrimination, etc)?Does announcing it this early hurt me in some way - demotion? Reassignment to make my life miserable? Ineligibility for an early buyout / retirement packages that may be announced in the next year ?If now is not the best time, when is the best time to benefit me the most?As many states are, Indiana is an at-will state, but does the little ""retiring"" check-mark next to my name change the game on this in any way?"

Does anyone have any idea/speculation why they would request my information? I was under the impression that I needed to give consent for that info to be pulled, should I be reporting this?"
[UK] How to stop employers knowing about my past.,"A few years ago I made the unwise decision of being homeless mainly to save money and be less dependant on jobs I disliked, it was supposed to be temporary but a few months turned in to a few years, when on a long unemployed stint I was a witness to a serious incident (which meant I went to hospital for a check up and believe they were told I was homeless but I personally only told the police) which was reported in the papers I avoided reading them but I know they revealed that I was homeless, when I finally got back into work it was obvious that my bosses knew things about me and had told others (this job was related with the NHS), this usually means I get treated kindly but that's the problem after being out in the cold so long any kindness sends me a bit crazy especially by women, I've lost two jobs because I developed insane crushes on people, my question is how can I get things cleared from my record? I have a unique name but if I google myself nothing comes up so I guess employers make more detailed searches or view my NHS file, also a few years earlier a guy was attacking someone in a shop and I helped stop him but it was reported that I had been in the shop when this man came in and attacked me!, this was in the papers but they spelt my name wrong so I'm not sure if this comes up, on another job a guy I was friends with was bullied I was called in to talk about this I tore into the place and I suspect they thought I had been bullied too, I don't use this employer as a reference or on my cv, is it possible new employers learn about this too? You might think I'm a bit paranoid but at least one person who wasn't a boss or supervisor mentioned that it would be hard to witness a similar incident I was a witness to. Thanks for any replies.Tl;dr How do I stop employers knowing about my (non criminal) past."
[INDIA]Should i take a followup again?,"got a call from HR from a good company. He explained the job role and shared the first assessment with me. I completed that and he again shared an aptitude test. I submitted it the same day within the deadline and informed him over email. Then 5 days later, I received an email from him that I have cleared both assessments and he is waiting for the time slot to schedule my interview. Then, 3 days later he called to inform me that the interview is scheduled for the day after tomorrow and that he'll let me know the time on the same day.But, I didn't receive any mail or invitation till the evening so I sent a follow-up email to him. He responded that he'll call the next morning to let me know the further process. But, I didn't receive any call or update. So, I called to know if there is any interview lined up for me. He said the interviewer is busy right now, he'll fix the meeting and let me know. It has been 2 weeks since then and I haven't gotten any update from HR. I have checked on the website, my application status is still in screening as 15 days ago.Should I take a follow-up again or is there something else I should do? Or, should I just wait for him to connect with me?"
"[MN] Employer messed up insurance enrollment, do I get a refund?","I started a new job last month and signed up myself for medical and dental insurance (they pay this cost 100% for the employee) and signed my husband up for just dental insurance. A week later I get my cards in the mail and realized my husband was signed up for both medical and dental insurance. I contact HR, tell them the enrollment mistake, they quickly get it fixed for me.However, on my first paycheck I was charged for the cost of the family medical insurance, even though I should have only been charged for the dental. They had already submitted payroll when I alerted HR to the mistake, so I assumed I would receive a refund on my next paycheck.  They did mention that they would have to make an ""adjustment"" to my next check. I just got paid again, and I didn't receive the refund I was expecting.Am I eligible for a refund? I overpaid originally because of their enrollment mistake, not my mistake. Or was the ""adjustment"" they mentioned just changing it so I wasn't charged the full medical premium amount again?"

[AZ] Background check inquiry,"Quick backstory: I work in industrial maintenance on the salaried management side. I have recently begun looking for a new position as my current company doesn‚Äôt believe in work life balance. I‚Äôve found a solid role in a major beverage manufacturer but a couple months ago I was arrested on misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Was a marital dispute with no violence but the cops were called due to the noise level, was held a night in jail and released on own recognizance.

[CAN] Possible Constructive Dismissal / Intimidation,"Hi all,The company I work for did some restructuring. I currently hold a position on the senior management team and my new position is a demotion in title. I will no longer be a senior leader, however my offer letter states that my pay will not change. Furthermore, it's currently not clear if the new position will have the same expectations and responsibilities as my current position.The company has be in acquisition mode for over a year, and during that time I was not told whether or no I would have a job come this November or not. When the offer letter finally came in, they have given me less than 24 hours to accept my position.I don't know how to proceed. I feel extremely pressured, threatened even, to sign so that I don't lose my job. Is there any advice? I want to keep working for the company but I am worried about how this will affect my career in the future as it is effectively a demotion. Is there anything I can ask for or negotiate into my new offer letter? Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated. I am reticent to provide more details as I don't want to doxx myself."
[TX] injured at work. do you have advice?,My husband has been injured at work twice. He works in a setting that deals with the offender population (not quite incarceration but not quite free). In one instance a resident injured my husband and he still going through the medical processes for that injury. He's waiting on an MRI for instance.And now he is injured again in a separate event. This one could be grounds for a lawsuit. There was a a permanent hazard that was never taken care of (old broken piece of the building sticking out) and it has now finally caused injury to an employee. My husband does not intend to sue but might the company fire him just because they expect a lawsuit?If he does file a lawsuit I would expect that be grounds for termination due to a conflict of interest. But even if he does not file a lawsuit could they still try to say that there is a conflict of interest? Or something along those lines?Basically what should we expect from the company? And also do you have any advice for what he should do as the employee who has been injured?
One of my white employees made his emoji a black skin tone thumbs up. A few black employees are offended. How should I even approach this? [CA],"I asked the employee who changed the skin tone to black to change it to something more if his complexion or just the yellow skin tone. He said he doesn‚Äôt feel he needs to. A few of our black employees have said they offended by this.I thought about telling everyone they need to change it back to yellow, but don‚Äôt think that would go over well.So how do I approach this?"
[MA] vacation balance rollover to next year question,Does anyone know if Massachusetts law states that employees must be allowed to rollover their earned PTO in the year it was accrued? Up to a certain amount I‚Äôd imagine.
"[WA] I'm a non-permanent state employee and I'm trying to get permanent status while still taking 3 months of paid family leave in the spring to take care of our foster kids. Oh, and I don't know who my boss is.","Act 1: A couple of years ago I took a non-permanent job with the State of Washington. I manage a few pandemic-related programs, 80% of which depended on the state of emergency for their legal authority. Despite the state of emergency ending last month and losing most of my team, my original position's expiration date has been extended time and time again. I've been told that they're trying to pass legislation to allow my programs to run without a state of emergency, and it's been implied that leadership is trying to find a way to keep me around until then so I can run the program. But right now I'm still non-permanent and I don't have any guarantee past my current end-date in March of next year.Act 2: Last January, we took placement of a foster child (our first) and I was able to take 12 weeks of paid family leave through a state program. (My agency is super supportive of people taking leave and it's the norm for folks to take full advantage of any time off they qualify for, which is great.) Three months later (April), our agency asked if we could take our kiddo's medical-needs sibling as well, and so we accepted our second placement. But because the state's paid leave program is built with bio-parents in mind and assumes you can't have two kids just three months apart, I wasn't allowed to take paid family leave for the new child. But one year after the first leave request, I again will be eligible to make a leave request and will qualify for 12 weeks of paid leave for our second child, which must be used within a year of that child's placement. What this means is that I will have 14 weeks in which to use 12 weeks of paid leave for a child who will have been in our care for 9 months. This year has been hell, and I would like to use it all.Entr'acte: My leave can only occur from January to April, and my position is currently set to expire in March. I worry that if I am on leave, they will not extend me again, and I will not be able to advocate for myself.Act 3: Over the past year, turnover in my office has been insane. My original supervisor left while I was on leave, and since then I have had three interim supervisors. The last one was only here a month, and when she left, they didn't even bother to replace her. (Supposedly they are in the hiring process for the permanent replacement, but how slow these things move so I'm not holding my breath.) I'm fortunate to have had incredibly supportive supervisors who I would normally talk to about these things. Because who knows, maybe three months of leave is exactly the kind of stall that helps the agency ""keep me around"" until my program passes through legislation? But there was no hand-off after the last supervisor left so I don't really know who my supervisor is. The automatic org chart that shows up in Outlook says that I report directly to someone who has historically been my boss's boss's boss, but I've only talked to him like twice, and he is WAY too high up in the organization for me to feel comfortable bothering him about... well, anything.I guess I don't have a real clear question here, but I would love any input at all. I'm just not sure where to go on this one."
[UK] Trying to leave a company,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve handed in my notice prior to my end of probation review so as per my contract would only like to work a weeks notice as for all intents and purposes they could have extended it at that meeting. My employer however is trying to argue that my probation was based on 3 months from the start of employment and the review meeting (a week after the end of the 3 months) doesn‚Äôt signify the end of probation so they are holding me to 1 month of notice. There is nothing clear in the clauses in my contract but I don‚Äôt mind messaging the full wording if anyone is able to take a look. Any advice would be appreciated as I‚Äôve got another job lined up in the next few weeks and don‚Äôt want to delay starting by working the 1 month notice."
[NJ] Employer messed up a parental leave request and I got paid through the state and by my employer when I shouldn't have. Employer refuses to help.,"Quick  background: my employer offers 4 paid weeks off for parental leave.  It's paid fully by them and is not part of NJ FLI or any other employer  programs.I submitted a request  for this benefit through my employer prior to the birth of my child, and  I was only required to provide proof of birth for the leave request to  be approved, which I did. So fast forward to my next pay statement which  covers the time included in this leave request, and I see that my  employer made a deduction for 'state disability offset.'I  called up the team that handles leaves requests and they said they  couldn't help me and that I'd have to speak with payroll. Payroll says  nothing other than 'I have to claim the benefits.' (our payroll team is  outsourced and probably doesn't know any more than that.)I  called the leave team again and then tell me that I have to fill out NJ  FLI to collect. Not knowing any better I went and applied for FLI.  Shortly after this my manager reached out to our assigned HR rep to ask  why my employer didn't pay 100% and he responds ""HR has fixed the  issue."" I assumed that this was the end of the confusion. My pay was  fixed when he said it would.Today  I received a debit card in the mail from the state because my FLI  benefits were still approved and paid out. So now I was paid by my  employer and NJ. My understanding is that NJ does not pay FLI benefits  if you were paid by your employer during this time frame. My manager  reached out to our HR contact who stated that my employer will not do  anything and that it is up to me to resolve this with the state.So  my issue / question is around this; at this point in time my employer  is not going to garnish my paycheck or take back the money they paid,  even though I'm in this situation because of their mistake. What is the  worst case if the state will not reclaim the benefits paid out to me,  and my employer won't take back the money they paid me? I don't want the  state benefits, and getting a hold of someone who can help has so far  been unsuccessful. I'm going to continue trying to contact the state by  phone in the meantime. I also filed an appeal with the state asking to  revoke the claim eligibility but have no idea how long that will take,  and I had planned on using FLI in December but can't because this claim  is still open.Thanks!"

[CA] Email Impersonation,"Hi all, I was hoping for a bit of advice on this.At work we use Outlook with our own specific domain (I may not be using the correct term‚Äîbut basically we all have the same ‚Äú@‚Äú after the username). I have been told by multiple peers that a verbally explicit email has been sent from a gmail account impersonating me (FirstnameLastname@gmail.com).Many of us are not tech savvy and often my peers send emails from their own personal accounts, so they may not know better. I work for a large organization so I cannot attest to how many people it has been sent to, at the very least two so far (and I only know this because they contacted me saying that the email was strange) but what are the appropriate steps in this situation? I have already given a heads up to my manager, HR, IT, and legal but I would love to know what the plan of attack should be so I can make sure that it is happening with all these groups.I would like to take legal action for impersonation if I find this person as I live in California."
[CA] sick hours + pregnancy,"I don‚Äôt know if this post belongs here but basically I‚Äôm pregnant and haven‚Äôt been feeling well so I have been using my sick hours. I can‚Äôt apply for FMLA or anything because I used it earlier this year for my baby bonding and won‚Äôt qualify until next year.So my job has different percentages of sick hours like 100%, 65%, etc. I used up all my 100% hours (they used all of it after my first pregnancy when I went on leave, I was not aware that they were going to use it, apparently I had to let them know beforehand if I didn‚Äôt want them to use it, no one asked, they just used it to pay me while I was gone) and throughout the year I did accumulate more but had to use it for this pregnancy.Because I haven‚Äôt been feeling good due to my pregnancy, can they fire me for using all my sick hours? I was told it doesn‚Äôt look good but I really have no other options and cannot afford losing my job. Apparently I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúunion‚Äù but what does that really do in protecting my job.Side note: I work for the county so there are thousands of workers doing the same job I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm not assigned to any tasks so I‚Äôm not really behind on anything."
[MD] hiring event scheduling programs,"Looking for programs to use for a hiring event, ideally would like to have a link where interested candidates can go on and select a time for the event.However, my issues is we will be conducting 4 interviews at a time, and need a program that allows 4 time slots at a time to be selected, Calendly only allows for one interview a lot with no duplicated times."

Is there a good time to contact whatever HR department you can find and inquire about it being under review? If so, who in the chain of command, do you think I should speak to? and also is there a recommended way to approach the subject when you speak to the person?"
[TX] Time off of work for elective surgery,"I've been to a consultation with the surgeon of my choice and I have the money for the procedure. The only problem is that after talking with the HR rep at my job, she told me they would not grant me the time off I need (6 weeks) because it is not medically necessary. She said I would have to use my PTO/vacation time. Problem is that I only have a total of about 3 weeks worth of time. I asked her if I could just take the 6 weeks without pay and she said that is not allowed. I've been wanting to get this surgery for years now after losing a lot of weight and I finally have the money for it. It has caused me a lot of anxiety and depression. My job is the only thing keeping me from doing it now. Does anyone here have any idea what other options I have?"

[CAN-ON] What should I do if I'm applying for a job but need to take parental leave in two months?,"I'm current unemployed and applying for jobs. My wife is pregnant and expecting in February. That means whatever job I find it will be less than three months  At what stage should I reveal that I need to take parental leave? Before the interview? After the interview? Before the job offer? First week? Month? I'm not quite sure about this. I have been telling them during job interviews and it has not worked out well. So far a few jobs that I'm perfectly qualified for an interviewed well in fell through. I expect because of the required time off. It makes me not want to tell HR anymore but that makes me feel like a liar. Plus, when they hire me and then I tell them about the pregnancy they can fire me without cause, then I'm screwed out of unemployment while I need income with a kid. Please offer your suggestions."
[AU] My workplace is expecting me to hotdesk as the only person who does not WFH regularly.,"This issue is... well, kinda simple. Most of my team WFH 4-5 days a week. I, however, work in the office every day. I say it's because I prefer the office. Mostly, it's so my below-average performance never gets coached.However, the company has decided to downsize and start a hotdesk system due to the lack of use of the office. Which is great! I fully support the decision to support people who WFH.Except they want me to give up my desk, that I use 5 days a week. And that's a little bit frustrating! I get it's not necessary for people who are barely in the office to have a dedicated space to work, but I'm not one of them.Unfortunately, my objections to HR - and my manager's - are getting lost in the outcry of people who are just upset about having to hotdesk one day a week. I don't know how to make it clear that I'm fine with hotdesking... just not for my always-in-the-office ass."
[CA] Employer forgot to sign me up for health insurance,"Hello!I started a new job in May of this year. This job had a 30 day probationary period. Once the probationary period ended, I'd be a full time employee with full benefits, including health insurance.However, at the end of these 30 days, I was never contacted about signing up for my benefits and I only recently realized the error. I never officially ""opted out"" nor did I make any enrollments...they just forgot about¬†me. After talking to a fellow coworker, I was informed that if I opted out of my insurance, I would be afforded an additional $300/month.¬†I reached out to HR last week about how I haven't had insurance¬†for 6 months because no one in HR ever followed up with me. They responded that they would sign me up next month, but that since ""I had screwed up by not asking about health¬†insurance"", they're not responsible for paying me six months of $300.¬†Should I push to get the $1800 of back pay? Any other advice for me?Thanks!"
"[CA] My boss invited my manager, a coworker, and me out to lunch on a Friday - could this be bad news?","My boss invited me, my direct manager, and one other person from my team out to lunch this Friday. We‚Äôve done lunch before with bigger groups but always with advanced discussions about how it was a social get together thing. This lunch invite was sent via outlook without any discussion prior or any specifics on why we are going out to lunch - just, ‚Äúhey guys, want to grab lunch next Friday?‚ÄùIt could be that the three of us are the only members of our team in the area and he just wants to be social as he is a really social and nice guy, but it just seems odd and out of the blue to me.

[MO] Accepted a new position with a specific salary but in my HR portal it reads slightly lower,"So I recently accepted a new position within my company and was told my salary would be 40k per year. I checked my HR portal pay information just to double check it was changed (There was a prior incident that my pay wasn't updated when they said it was and I had to ask for back pay.)So when I checked the portal it says my actual compensation is 39,999.96 per year.What reason would they have for my pay to be 4 cents under the number they said I was at?Not upset, I'm just trying to see if there's any other reason why 4 cents would matter. My first guess was they were throwing me a bone on my tax bracket but a quick Google proved that seemingly invalidTIA!"

[IL] Terminated for Dishonesty when Reporting a rude Manager,"Hello. I was yelled at by a manager within my company for no apparent reason at all. I was sitting down completing a task and she comes near the door saying ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?"" Maybe thats how she talks to everyone, but I felt intimidated for sure. And it doesn't make it right if that's how she talks to everyone. She sounded extremely rude. So I reported her to her manager and another manager.  I don't report to this manager but the coworkers who were witnesses do. When the company completed their internal investigation they claimed I was dishonest and terminated me. I wasn't being dishonest nor did I have anything to gain by being dishonest. This is simply how I perceived her tone to be angry and intimidating. All I wanted was for her manager to talk to her and make her aware that it's not appropriate to talk to people like that at work. But now I'm terminated. So much for an open-door policy with no fear for retaliation. Do I have any options?"

[OH] Short Term Disability Check in error,"Hello! Looking for some professional advice on this because I‚Äôm utterly confused about what my next step is.I (f32) had hip surgery on October 18th.

[MO] Will accuser learn there was counter-evidence?,"Hello,A few months ago I (male) was brought into an HR investigation; my accuser was both a close professional and personal friend (female). I was very surprised at this. The accusation was essentially that I asked her about her personal life when she had said not to, and that I was uncomfortable and inappropriate with her via text messages.As the questioning of me started, I answered truthfully and mentioned that I had text messages from her sharing personal things like hobbies, initiating conversation with me, asking me to meet her for parts of a work event, and/or thanking me for things like medicine I gave her, etc--in other words proving that what she accused me of was not true. When I brought this up, the tone of the investigation changed and they were very eager for me to send HR screenshots of my text messages. I ended up sending almost two years worth of texts (we did not text all the time, but I still had ample evidence that she initiated things with me, etc.)When the follow-up occurred, I was cleared as there was no evidence to support her claim due to my evidence.My questions are:When she made the accusation, would she have had to provide any evidence (would seem odd since we both would have the same text conversation)when the accuser had her follow-up at the close of the investigation, would she have been told there was evidence proving she was not being truthful--and if so, would she learn the nature of what I was able to share? Knowing her, I am sure she would be shocked and would want to know how it would be possible.Thank you."
[oh] Fully disclosed past DUI and travel to Canada,"I asked this question in ask a lawyer where it‚Äôs very suited but would like feedback from an experienced HR person.Good morning.  I am an engineering working in Ohio.  February of 2020 I had a dui which prevents travel to Canada.  You have to have a temporary resident permit or rehab permit which takes time to process this.When I started this job I fully disclosed to my current boss and his boss I had this and at first declined the offer due to this.  I was told this was not an issue and to take the job by them, not the recruiter.Fast forward to three months ago.  A job was going on in Canada and I was asked to go.  I mentioned I couldn‚Äôt and sent him an email and his boss an email, ( which I saved, disclosing this.).   I told him in person about the temporary resident permit processing.  I told him I was unsure how long it would take.Fast forward to 11/11, last Friday.  I was asked formally in an email to make plans to go to Canada which I politely mentioned in the email I couldn‚Äôt due to passport issues.  The boss asked why I couldn‚Äôt go, about the personal details of why which I disclosed the DUI again, and reminded him I told him and his boss when I started.  He wanted to know all the details of what I was doing which I mentioned the temporary resident permit, etc.  He mentioned it was up to me to figure out how to get it done and the job done.  I was to report back to him on how I was going to cross the border.  (In his fit of anger and yelling he said I needed to go and lie at the border.  I do not have that recorded.)I forwarded the boss and his boss my application for a temporary resident permit reply from Canadian Consulate general saying it was processing.  I mentioned again I could not travel at this time.  The only other option is show up at the border with all the paperwork filled out and see if I can cross which often is allowed. I received a reply back from his boss saying keep doing what I‚Äôm doing.I‚Äôm not a loud or controversial person.  I keep quiet and work very hard, around 55 hours a week and help people in recovery.  I‚Äôm not trying to stir the pot at work.What do I do to protect myself, especially in a right to work state.  All email correspondences I save.  I have not recorded any conversations yet and I don‚Äôt know if they are admissible without two party consent their being recorded.  I‚Äôm trying to protect myself against backlash.(Keep in mind no one else has a passport and is being asked.  It‚Äôs his nature to bully people.)"
[FL] How should I of handled this situation (in case it happens again)?,"I started a new job on October 2nd.   I agreed to a set schedule of 36 hours per week on certain days.   I quickly picked up the job and was doing well and it was something that came easy to me.I quit just a few days ago because the manager fired a coworker (because she couldn‚Äôt be flexible with the schedule), then suddenly I‚Äôm covering that girls shift.   Then another coworker has to take FMLA.  I‚Äôm suddenly assigned (without it being asked) 70 hours per week.  Twelve hour days/6 days per week.   I physically and mentally cannot do that.I brought it up to my manager and said this is definitely not going to work.  And I‚Äôm fact, I‚Äôm going to need to go back to our original agreement and work the schedule that I was originally assigned to.   She just couldn‚Äôt have that.  So I quit.I‚Äôm still disappointed because it was a job I was capable of and that I felt I was good at.   Is there anything I could of done differently rather than just quitting?"
"[TX] need accommodations due to disability, but due to specifics of role those aren‚Äôt possible- is company likely to be willing or otherwise obligated to find another spot for me?","Hi AskHr, I‚Äôm currently on FMLA and STD due to a fairly serious/well documented chronic illness. I‚Äôm set to return to work on January 12th. I work at a startup that‚Äôs killing it atm and has between 200-400 employees. I‚Äôve been here for a little over 1.5 years.As I‚Äôm taking the time off to re-assess my health and capabilities, I‚Äôm realizing the type of working conditions I need to be successful moving forward career wise are pretty reasonable- namely just flexible working hours and a less psychologically taxing position (in my role now I‚Äôm exposed to a lot of dark stuff, like there‚Äôs a few former 911 dispatchers on my team to give an idea).These conditions are completely not compatible with my current position. My team runs 24/7 and I do 4, 10-hour shifts/week. It‚Äôs the kind of work where if I‚Äôm not doing it someone else has to be, so flexible working hours are not possible by nature of the position. And it would be impossible to remove the darker psychological parts of the job.So I‚Äôm basically realizing I can‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt continue in my current position, but I really would like to stay with my current company if at all possible- what should I do? There are a few people on my team who work non-shift hours, but they are mostly leadership level. I don‚Äôt expect them to have to accommodate me when I can‚Äôt do the basic functions of the role I‚Äôve been performing and was hired for, though I plan to have a talk with them soon.Another idea I had is talking to HR about shifting to another position within the company. My team does a very distinct function than what the rest of the company does. Even before my health took a big turn for the worse, I was considering talking to my boss about getting some exposure to our sales team and their process. In my 2 previous roles I could have been a customer to my company‚Äôs product, and I have 3.5 years experience in this business now and feel I could really help with my contacts and understanding customer needs. I‚Äôve also always just thought I‚Äôd be good at sales. I‚Äôm early in my career and happy to take an entry level role in sales or something else like business development, customer success, etc.So questions for the HR rockstars- what would be the best way to go about communicating the above? Does my company have any obligation to try to accommodate me? I understand if not as like I‚Äôve said I cannot perform my current role, no reasonable accommodation is possible. Any/all advice would be appreciated here, including if you think it would just be better for me to seek employment elsewhere. I do know my company is fairly obsessed with employee retention- it was one of this year‚Äôs top goals."
What is a good response to ‚ÄúThis sounds like you don‚Äôt trust me.‚Äù When I bring up a safety or any other concern to my boss. [UT],"I was just transferred direct reports.

[TX] Sterling Background Check: I accidentally uploaded repeated W-2's,"HelloJust have a question regarding a background check. On 11.9.22 Sterling asked for W-2 information, gave me 48 hrs to upload, and I uploaded them. Got them from IRS website.Today I go back to check w-2's(since background check taking a while) and I noticed the w-2s were the same ones for same year (I saved them with different year but it turns out its the same w-2 file). Will sterling give me a chance to fix this or am I screwed? I have no idea how I didn't catch this. I feel like an idiot.I sent an email with correct W-2's and will also give them a call on Monday."
[VA] FBI Background Check Taking Long Time - Should I Worry?,"I received a contingent job offer to work for a government contractor, everything was signed and returned (offer letter, W-4, application, self-identification form, etc.) and I received information on the benefits package. The only contingency is passing an FBI background check, which isn't an issue for me since I have a clean background and have been a clearance holder for over 10 years.My concern is that it's been almost 30 days since I was fingerprinted and submitted electronically; 2 weeks ago my hiring manager said everything should be done shortly but wasn't told anything more than that.I know this company isn't a scam and I know my hiring manager/future manager actually works for this company.Should I be worried or am I overthinking too much?"

[NY] Should I ask for more than I want or exactly what I want during negotiations with headhunters and hiring managers?,"I am always between two uncomfortable spots: worried I am asking for too much which will turn off the potential employer, and worried I am being super na√Øve in negotiations and letting myself get run over. Maybe the former concern is a silly one to have though?For additional context, I work in logistics and have 8 years of experience in the field but only at the entry level and lowest management tiers (managing work but not people). I will be moving from SC so going from low CoL to high. The base pay for an entry level job there is already higher than what I'm making but the difficult part for me is factoring in my experience into what I should start at myself up there."

[NY] Is it illegal to prefer veterans in the private sector?,"I run a small legal services company - we basically hire attorneys on a temporary basis to work on projects, paid hourly.  I am a veteran, and a lawyer myself, and we have found success when hiring military veterans.  I would like to help out veterans if I can.  Is it discriminatory (and therefore illegal) to state that veterans receive preference when I post job opportunities? We operate and employ people in DC, MD, VA, NY, CT, NJ and Illinois, but are incorporated in NY.I used to work for law firms with a robust HR department I could pose questions to.  I am asking because I am kind of on my own, and don't want to mess up or create risk needlessly.Also, I think the requirement that all posts must have a location is kind of outdated.  Like many companies, we are 100% remote, and need to think about rules in a myriad of jurisdictions."

Company locker battle [PA],"I‚Äôm having a problem with a rule oriented manager.At my job we are required to use lockers with a combination lock. I have a condition where my hands shake. It‚Äôs not consistent but it‚Äôs severity ranges from slight tremors to requiring medication to allow me to have control of my hands.  My doctors don‚Äôt have a formal diagnosis for it. I also have documented adhd, I am neurodivergent to say the least. The combination lock takes me at least 10 tries because I sometimes shake without knowing the degree I turned it. This is very frustrating to me. What is more frustrating is I don‚Äôt have a formal diagnosis and I would have divulge medical history that would be hard to document but also draining emotionally. I opted to see if I skate by not using it.I decided to not use my locker and my manager confronted me about it. So I obliged her concern by not bringing any personal items in that couldn‚Äôt fit on my person. I still use the locker to keep my headset but that‚Äôs all. It is empty otherwise. I keep it unlocked so I don‚Äôt have to waste unpaid time trying to fight with the locker. Recently my manager has been going out of her way to lock my locker during my shift. Today it happened for the 3rd time this week alone and I snapped. I told my manager I‚Äôll no longer need the locker and to feel free to give it to a new hire.I plan now to keep the headset in my car. Any advice when she surely will confront me tomorrow? Will I have to divulge my medical problem if she takes this further? Thanks in advance."
[IN] Should I file an HR complaint?,"Hi, sorry if this is a stupid question. Lots of details. Been a rough day.Long story short is I am about to leave my job and an emotional coworker thinks it's fine to use me as an emotional punching bag. It has happened multiple times since I put in my notice. Management is turning a blind eye.Should I file a complaint?More details below for the curious. I work in a high stress job. I put in my notice of resignation a few weeks ago. My last day is next Sunday. My work requires 4 weeks notice.About a week and a half ago a coworker with a known history of emotional meltdowns had one at me. A single other person witnessed it. She essentially hated the workload I gave her and then yelled and me for 5-10 minutes with a lot of personal insults. She would not let me get a word in. She stomped off and has been giving me the cold shoulder.She then told management I was bullying her. I learned this when I sent a neutral email documenting the episode and how I was worried that she was getting too stressed out. Management told me I needed to cater to her needs more and said I didn't make her feel like part of a team. Then tells me ""it is no secret you don't like her""I actually have no problem with her, I had told management in confidence that the job I am quitting (because it is too stressful) was probably too stressful for her as well and she needed extra support due to this."
[NJ]how is unemployment calculated with FMLA and vacation?,I was just terminated. I've been reading unemployment is calculated using a year of base pay. I took 5 weeks of vacation this year and also 6 weeks of FMLA that was without pay. Does this all effect my unemployment or is that just calculated for hours worked?
[WI] Overpaid: did I handle this correctly?,"My company's HR reached out to me today to tell me they had mistakenly deposited both my pay and the pay off another employee with the same name. They said they could deduct the overage from my remaining checks for this year, but I said I would prefer if they reversed the deposit and then deposited the correct amount, and that I understood it would take longer because of the federal holiday today and it being a weekend.Did I handle this correctly? Should I have done it differently? This has never happened to me before."

Is it safe I didn't get the job? I would have thought they would have updated my application from submitted to declined but maybe not. Feeling really frustrated."
[IN] Holidays and Hourly Averages For Benefit Eligibility,"Hey comrades! Fellow HR person here - I recently stepped into an HR generalist role with a home health agency (woof). I've already seen a lot of janky stuff, but it's actually teaching me a lot.I have an LPN that hired on in March to specifically take care of one particular patient, and since then that LPN has consistent worked 30.5-31.75 hours per week, putting them firmly in eligible status for benefits. The only time this hasn't been true has been the observation of our holidays. Since hired, we have observed Memorial Day, Juneteenth, the 4th, and Labor Day. By observing these holidays, that takes the LPN to 29.88 hours, end my branch's CFO tried to cancel their benefits. Luckily one of the owner's intervened.This strikes me as very shaky. Would love some other thoughts. Thanks so much in advance!"
Was given bad FSA advice- any way to change? [FL],"[FL] Was given bad FSA adviceEdit: when I asked HR they immediately stopped my fsa payments for me and were really nice about everything. Thanks, HR universe.I started a new job midyear, and was advised very confidently by HR that I could use the dependent care FSA to pay for childcare expenses incurred at any point during the year- including (in defiance of common sense) prior to my starting this job.My prior employer didn‚Äôt offer dependent care FSAs.Anyway, I just filed a claim and obviously the part prior to my joining the current company was denied, so it looks like there will be about $1,500 in my dependent care FSA at the end of the year that I‚Äôll be unable to use.Given that I set up my (substantial) contributions on this one piece of bad advice, and turning them off now would allow me to not lose $390 from each of the remaining three pay periods this year- is there any way to turn contributions off or am I just screwed?I‚Äôm really irritated over this."

Figuring out how much time to take off after a career change [NY],"I recently retired from teaching after 5 years. The last day of school was at the end of June, but technically my resignation wasn't official until September 6th. I decided to leave largely because I realized I needed an easier job. I'm planning on doing a career transition into tech, because I was a computer science major in college and it's probably my strongest marketable skill.In the mean time, I've been taking time off. Time off to not stress out about work for the first time in a while. I was speaking to a friend of mine who works in tech, and he advised me to start working again sooner rather than later. He said because of the recession, getting a job will only get more and more difficulty if I wait too long, and too large of a gap might not look good on a resume.However, I mentioned this recently to a friend who works in HR, and he was a lot less worried that this would be an issue at all. He told me that if an applicant to his company had a job within the last 6 months, he wouldn't even bring it up at all, and that because I'm doing a career change, I could probably take a year off without much of an issue.Wanted to ask what the general consensus might be on who I should listen to hear and how long of a break is ok. For what it's worth, I was planning on seriously looking for work around the New Year."

My boss gave me a raise and I‚Äôd like to ask for time to consider the amount and consider negotiating a higher compensation. Advice? [MA],I got promoted from graphic designer to senior designer this fall and did not automatically get a raise to reflect this. So I asked my boss and he said ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù and came back with a $3 more an hour. My job is fantastic in every way except for the salary. It‚Äôs part-time so it‚Äôs hourly and I get paid very low for a designer. The raise suggested was $22‚Äì>$25. His email seemed to leave an opening for negotiation. He said ‚Äúlet me know if you are okay with this and I‚Äôll make the changes in payroll.‚Äù Since it‚Äôs Friday I thought I could email him thanks and tell him I would get back to him with my answer on Monday so I can prepare over the weekend how I might negotiate for a higher rate. I just don‚Äôt know if this the right course of action.
[UK] How should I approach requesting unpaid leave / unpaid sabbatical?,"There is nothing about unpaid leave in my contract, and I don‚Äôt think we have an employee handbook as far as I‚Äôm aware, so there‚Äôs no official policy on unpaid leave. I want to take about 3 months of unpaid leave for personal reasons. I‚Äôm in an entry level analyst role and have been working here for 10 months. Is there anything that I can say to my company that will make it more likely for them to allow it?I don‚Äôt know how the process works for HR and whether it is difficult for them to change/pause my contract. Would it be worth suggesting other options, like moving to part-time (2 days a week) for 3 months and then returning to full-time?"
US[TX] Kronos/UKG clock in location,So I work in an environment where some of our employees have VPN access. We need them to clock in and out at an approved site and we can track them if they use the VPN. The issue comes from them using the VPN to remote into desktops at the approved location. Will Kronos be able to get their location from the VPN at all or will it take it from the desktop they remoted into? We would rather not take away those desktops as they do need to be able to remote into them from time to time. Any info is appreciated.
I‚Äôm being targeted by workplace bullies. I finally said something to management today and I feel stupid [MI],"I‚Äôm a 30 y/o woman living in [MI] and in my 11 years of working I have never had a group of people dislike me so deeply. My managers and upper managers like me. I am on of the top sales performers as well.I‚Äôll try to make this long story short.Last Sunday after I finished with a client a member of my team who we will call Sabrina started going around to all of my other teammates whispering something to them. I started to feel uncomfortable because I really felt like she was gossiping about me and I am not a confrontational person. I called my manager and let him know I wasn‚Äôt feeling well so I left.Yesterday I worked with Sabrina, she didn‚Äôt speak to me but I was busy with appointments throughout my day anyway so I didn‚Äôt interact with many coworkers.Today I come into work and Sabrina was standing in a circle what looked to me like gossiping. Someone walked into the store I work at and I know him personally from outside of work so I said hi to him. Sabrina went up to him and asked if he needed help. Shortly after i asked him how he has been and how long he would be in town for. I let him know he has my number if he needs anything.I walked away and Sabrina said didn‚Äôt you just see me greet him? I said yeah I know but I personally know him. Another coworker who seemed to have been gossiping said ‚Äúyou say that every time it‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äù The other two coworkers she was standing around refuse to talk to me ever since Sunday. Nobody ever told me what I did wrong. I‚Äôm assuming I sold a lot and left early so they were annoyed by that. However I did leave because the gossiping was making me so anxious I couldn‚Äôt work.Sabrina kept throwing jabs at me throughout the day. At the end of the day I had a client come in, he had an exchange. He was in the fitting room trying it on and came out to show his friends and ask for their opinion. Sabrina was standing next to me the whole time because she was helping the friends. I don‚Äôt believe she realized that this client was doing an exchange that I had originally sold him. So when I told him it looks nice and he should get that one she muttered ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to learn today‚Äù.I walked away and called my supervisor and let him know of everything that was going on. He had witnessed her complaining about me earlier. I told him what has been happening with the team and how she‚Äôs behaving. I have never gone to management over a coworker.TLDR; Sabrina used to be a work friend, we‚Äôre both the same age and attractive women. I relate more to the customers I think and clients do seem to gravitate toward me. Where she kind of walks around, stares in the mirrors and talks to associates all day.Two weeks ago she screamed at me for trying to ‚Äútake her customer‚Äù (he wasn‚Äôt being helped and was walking around trying to find anyone to assist him) she pointed her finger in my face and wouldn‚Äôt stop yelling. I had to tell her to leave me alone 3 times."
"I am my line manager's PA, is there anyway to avoid putting them down as a reference? [UK]","I am currently applying for a new job because 1) my contract is up in one year and 2) My line manager never acts like a line manager, or like he cares about the part of the job that I support him with 3) Found a couple of interesting options. It would be very awkward for him to know I was looking for a new job, and he is TERRIBLE at answering emails so I know I would be the one reminding him to do my own reference. I know that I don't have to include him as a reference, but two would be standard, my previous manager is fine, but the one before that I can't work out if she is still in her role. I am a bit isolated here and I can't think of anyone else to in my current role to use as a reference. One role I am applying for would be an internal move, so in their application system I can only include contact details for my supervisor anyway with y/n for whether or not they can contact. Should I just leave him as a no and leave the one contact from my previous role?"
"[PT] Dramas in the company I work, could you give me an advice?","Good morning Reddit,There are some problems going on at the current company where I work, and I'm not getting a good handle on it, it never seems to stop.The company started less than two years ago in Portugal and the head office is in Germany. I started as Front Office Manager, then we recruited controller, accountant, marketing, now IT, etc.However, I am not the human resources of the company. I am not in charge here, although I have been appointed as manager. But honestly I'm getting tired of all these dramas.Since a girl from Marketing came in, the dramas started. The accountant and the controller are very good friends and they don't like the way the Marketing girl is dealing with some issues, as she is creating dramatic situations. They put my name in the mix, accuse me of having already talked to her about things and that she is against me.The truth is that the marketing girl is not acting well, and we have all talked to her. But the accounting girl and the controller aren't either, and the controller girl is having such an attitude towards me that it seems like she is the boss of the whole thing.I wanted to ask what kind of attitude I should have towards this, because I'm tired of dramas, I'm tired of everything coming to me, I'm tired of putting up with these ""Boss"" attitudes when they are not in charge here, but because they speak German they think they rule this place...I emphasize that I don't want to be the boss here or anything, I just want to do my job in peace, without having to put up with all this drama. I feel that the controller girl has an inner urge to move up in life and feels that she is not being appreciated. I have it too, but I don't make that feel in the company.After these last events the desire to leave is greater and greater to be honest."
[VA] How to approach my job about participation in a medical study requiring a long term inpatient stay?,"One of my doctors told me about a case study the National Institute of Health (NIH) is conducting that has the potential to help tremendously with a disability of mine.I applied and I completed the initial screening interview. During that interview they told me that due to the use of anesthesia in the treatment process, I would need to stay at the NIH for two months and I would recive the treatment 3 times a week. I work 100% remotely and I asked if I could still work during my stay, they said yes but obviously I wouldn't be able to maintain my current schedule exactly. I mostly passed the initial screening with one potential hang up but the clinician would make the final determination if I could move to the next step of the application.I haven't told my job anything yet because it was just the initial screening. Yesterday the clinician reached out to set up the next screening interview.I'm not quite sure how things work here since it is technically a medical treatment but the study aspect murkies things. My job does offer short term and long term disability policies and they do offer FMLA.How should I approach things if it looks like I will be accepted into the study? Do I have any legal protections because it is treatment for a disability?Edit: National Health Institute -> National Institute of Health"
[IL] Underwhelmed with my 3.3% raise. Has anyone ever successfully gone back to their boss and gotten a better raise?,"Been at the company which is smaller and doing quite well for a year. On my anniversary I got an email from my boss thanking me for my service and outlining my 3.3% (basically, inflation) raise.I‚Äôve worked my butt off this year learning and adapting at the extremely specialized nature of the product this company manufactures. The company has a very small, interwoven team that I‚Äôve meshed well with. I‚Äôve had nothing but positive comments from management and co-workers, so to say I‚Äôm disappointed with this barely a raise is an understatement. The company has no formal review process, no goal setting, and very little actual training.  I fee so disheartened after all the work and effort I‚Äôve put in over the last year wasn‚Äôt rewarded financially.HR peeps, any stories of people going back to management about their raise, and how that went? Suggestions on how to handle? Do I just say ok, thanks, and start looking for something new?I know you‚Äôre all going to tell me it‚Äôs time to leave this job, and sadly, that‚Äôs probably the road I‚Äôll have to take. I won‚Äôt be able to leave until after the 1st of the year so I can receive my annual bonus, profit sharing, and 401(k) match."
[CA] Sign On Bonus Repayment,"Hi- I started a new job in early 2022 and received a $10k sign on bonus with the notice that it would be due back if I did not complete 15 months with the company. Due to relocation and other personal reasons I am resigning and understand my sign on bonus needs to be returned per my contract as it is less than a year. A few questions: 1. As it is the same tax calendar year do I need to pay back the full $10k or just the net amount I received (~$6k)? 2. Is an employer required to enforce the same policy for every employee with a sign on bonus? For example, if someone left earlier than I did and I know was not required to pay it, but I am being required to pay it, does that matter/ is there anything I can do? I assume not, but wanted to ask for any expert advice as to how to navigate. 3. Is it standard that this would need to be repaid before my last day or is there an appropriate amount of time available to pay back- for instance if my new employer is willing to cover this cost. Thanks in advance!"
[VA] Negotiating Additional PTO in Job Offer,"I was offered an internal recruiting role with 80 hours of PTO. Before this I was at an unlimited PTO company (before they switched it was 120 hours), then on a contract and could kinda do whatever whenever. It‚Äôs been really nice and I‚Äôve always planned around 120 hours of vacation a year because of that.Based on the PTO policy I‚Äôve read for this new company employees in year 0-4 of employment with the company you receive 80 hours, 5-9 years, 120, 10-14 years, 160, etc..Is there any use in asking to start with more PTO or is it a futile attempt based on their policy that is dated last revision‚Ä¶ April 2007.I‚Äôve never negotiated an offer as until now, they‚Äôve felt fair for my experience and personal desires for a position / benefits. I‚Äôm not really sure how to approach the conversation or if it‚Äôs even worth it since their PTO policy is clearly expressed."
[NY] No System Access,"You ever been hired for a job but the job set you up to fail? Okay here‚Äôs the dilemma I was hired to do a job but when I got there the systems I need in order to do my job weren‚Äôt even set up for me. Now I have to wait a month for the credentials because someone dropped the ball. Of course I need the training but how can I get the training if I don‚Äôt have the necessary tools to train? My trainer also doesn‚Äôt want to train me with her credentials because obviously it‚Äôs attached to her name even if she sits behind me to watch. I‚Äôm stuck between going there everyday and getting paid to do nothing or just speak to my director in charge (which he was made aware of the issue but never addressed me about it). Morally it‚Äôs wrong for me to stay but it‚Äôs morally f*** up they didn‚Äôt have their ish together before hiring me.I‚Äôm so torn. I really love the hours, pay and my coworkers so far (after 5 weeks). It just bothers me to sit and do nothing. Advise is needed at this point."
[OK] Found out I was ineligible for rehire despite two weeks notice,"I worked for a small hospital network. I applied for a job at another hospital within the network. I found out from the manager during the interview that she apparently had been lied to about my responsibilities. To use an analogy - she was told I only made hamburgers, when I was regularly scheduled at and worked the fry station and the shake machine. It is on paper and electronic forms. I accepted a job at a separate hospital and gave two weeks notice and left on good terms, on time, all that.Months later my previous employer's recruiter contacted me (my job is in high demand) and for fun I responded only to find out I was ineligible for rehire until a year had past... anywhere in the network. I received no reason why from HR as they ""didn't have access to that information."" I was referred to the senior HR person who would not tell me anything. Is management that spiteful? They made me what they called the ""acting supervisor"" without my asking."
[AZ] Wage difference,"I was hired recently (about a month ago) and have just found out the even newer hire (hired about a week or two ago) doing the same work I am is making just under 2 dollars more than me an hour, and he also said management told him not to tell others what he is making, what would I be able to do to get myself that same wage without causing a big scene and getting me and/or my coworker in trouble, we are in a union, ufcw I believe."
Drug test (current employee) [TX],"Hi there,I am currently employed for a company that is partnered with other businesses across the nation. In order to be in compliance with a certain location, they asked to receive my drug results. My company then launched a drug screen on their behalf as they did not have this on file.

"[CA] Quitting during holiday break, or during paid vacation after - how will payment work?","My husband currently works in a school (Instructional Aide in California) and gets salary paid monthly. However we are moving soon out of country and considering moving during the winter break (last 2 weeks of December and first week January) and therefore needing to quit.He is salary and doesn‚Äôt really get paid holidays, but rather the same amount every month for almost the whole year, including December and January even though they include the winter break. We are confused whether he will still get paid his regular salary for all of December if he puts in his resignation during the break (on January 1 for example). Or if we have him take paid vacation time to extend that break another few weeks (so he would last be physically present at work in mid December) but resigns during that vacation time, will his paycheck reflect only the 2 weeks he actually worked in December and the 2 weeks of vacation time VS being paid all of December?Edit: Or more simply, what can he expect his December and January paychecks to look like if he resigns January 1 for example( still during winter break) or if he adds 2 weeks paid vacation time to the winter break and quits during that vacation time in January.We are hoping to at least have his full December paycheck.I hope that‚Äôs clear!

[CA] guardian disability insurance and state disability insurance help,"[CA] Hi everyone! I'm going on short term disability and I was told conflicting information so I would appreciate your help.

[MA] Handling potential harassment,"I have a coworker who annoys me, and I feel like lately it's crossed the line from annoying to harassment. She's purposely left me out of company parties, out of office hangouts, and is passive aggressive in tone when speaking to me. The issue that I felt actually crossed the line is that she left me out of a group email informing everyone that another coworker had tested COVID positive.I did comment to our manager about that particular incident, and since then, she's been noticeably nicer to me. However, I'm worried that this is temporary. Is it worth going to HR now when nothing has really happened, or should I wait if/until something does?"

New Company Culture Rollout [CT],"So my company is increasing its focus on the ""company culture"" and today they released a brochure of basically what an ideal employee is. These traits range from simple things like honesty to more abstract things like maintaining a work life balance.I dont take exception with any of these tenets but rather the entire notion of company culture. I feel very uncomfortable with being assigned a personality. I feel very angry that I've had to be at this company for 5+ years without knowing what the recipe for success is. Finally, I feel like I am unable to express these feelings without risk of being fired...What options do I have to participate in the culture Rollout or to express my issues with it?"

Advice on handling a coworker that does not play well with others at a tech startup in [AZ],"I work at a small start-up with ~20 full-time employees, and for the most part, I love my job and the people I work with.There is one coworker, whom I will call Josh, that routinely gets in conflict with everyone else. Josh is a 21y guy that has no problem stepping on anyone to get what he wants and never faces any repercussions because his father is the VC of the company. His father is also the ""HR"" person at the company so complaints to HR regarding his behavior are futile. Josh doesn't follow standard company procedures and doesn't think any of the rules apply to him. To be fair, he is right because he doesn't follow the rules and nothing ever happens to him.I regularly have to apologize to our clients for his behavior and mistakes (I am in a client-facing role, but Josh is not) and there is 0 intervention from management.This is an example of how I have been approaching the situation and what I said to my manager recently regarding this coworker-""Sometimes Josh says things to me that I feel are combative and disrespectful or that make it seem as if I don't know how to do my job. I often feel bullied by him to do things that are not in the best interest of the company - (specific examples of his behavior ) or make exceptions to standard company procedures. I want to make sure that I am handling those situations correctly.""My manager's response was essentially ""You're handling things correctly, I understand you are frustrated but there's nothing I can do"".At this point, I am so frustrated that I am contemplating quitting because I feel there will never be any improvement. Since I can't rely on management or HR to help with this problem, I would love some advice on how to handle it directly with my coworker."
[OH] Job Hopping,I am in desperate need of a new job and have been interviewing at a few jobs that I haven‚Äôt been super thrilled about but at this point am ready to take any offer I get. My question is if I want to keep looking after I take the next offer how to answer interview questions about why I am looking for a job when I recently started a new position. Any thoughts?
[CA] I was given a severance agreement that says if I want additional payment I have to comply with so and so clauses (question in body),"Some of the clauses say I can't talk about the severance terms (but before I sign it, can I discuss those terms and just stop discussing it after I sign it?).Also there's a clause that says I'd have to be available whenever they ask me to do work for them for a few months after the termination. Is that weird or standard?There's also a final clause that says I can't look for new work until after the several months after my termination. Weird or standard?"
"[MA] Is this normal? Scope of work is going beyond that I expected, pay is still the same (agriculture)","For context, I work in viticulture. As it is, we generally do a lot of non-agricultural warehouse and winery work in addition to vineyard work, like filling and labelling bottles, operating wine pumps, taking gravity readings, chaptalizing, etc. Since we're technically ""agricultural workers"", we don't get paid overtime for this, even during the harvest season when we regularly work 50-70 hours.On its own, this is a little iffy since the legal precedent in our area defines agricultural work as the cultivation, handling, sorting, packaging, and preparation of produce for market. That being said, I'm not sure how the law considers processed foods like wine in the equation, and whether the duties we perform fall under that definition.Our harvest season has recently ended, so my boss has had us doing pretty much exclusively non-ag work (putting away the season's equipment, organizing the warehouse, etc.) I was even brought along to haul stuff out of his basement one day, which was admittedly a little weird.He's also recently acquired a neighboring estate, and decided to start renovating the house there to rent out (which must have been built sometime in the 50's). Obviously he needed some muscle to tear it up, so we were called on to help.Honestly I wouldn't even mind the odd jobs if there wasn't the potential of a health hazard and I was paid accordingly. The work is fun and engaging (though the pay is obviously garbage). It's just started to seem much less worthwhile, with the possibility of exposure to lead paint, asbestos wallpaper, mold, all that good stuff. I brought a respirator and P100s from home, but he only really offered construction grade filter masks and one communal respirator to the other guys :(It's also frustrating that our compensation hasn't changed despite our versatility, essentially transitioning to house-flipping contractors.I guess I'm mostly curious about people's thoughts on how to navigate growing companies still acting a bit ""small"" in how they operate and manage. Is this normal? I've opened up a discussion about increasing my wages, but I'm also not sure if it's my place to offer my input in their operations as well, since I've only worked two seasons, about a year in total."

[OR] Was it appropriate for my former boss to say this at the meeting for my counteroffer?,"This is more of an ethics question. I'm about to leave a GlassDoor review for my former employer but then I remembered this interaction & it kinda rubbed me the wrong way- was this appropriate?I will try to stream-line this bc I have a tendency to over-explain/make it humorous.I'm a stranger on the internet so believe me or don't, but I was/am damned good at what I do. suffice to say, I've never stopped grinding & learning & I know my worth.I worked for ""Business, Inc."" for 3 years with no bonuses nor raise nor option for hybrid work (work-from-home, despite being 100% digital & deemed an 'essential' worker)I didn't enjoy the corporation itself, but I enjoyed my duties & my coworkers & saw myself working there for a long time.Was treated poorly by mgmt 1 too many times & started looking for an opening at competitors' sites. I didn't REALLY want to leave, I just wanted fair compensation. Due to union turmoil, no one was given raises for 5ish years & getting a counter-offer was the only way to get more money (a coworker in another dept confided this to me after she did something similar & they quietly gave her a raise in exchange for keeping it a secret; no i did not bring this up to my boss as leverage)Fast-forward 2 weeks & I have a job offer on the other side of town at 1 of ""Business, Inc.""'s direct competitors. Their offer was more than I had even asked for(!) & was basically a $6K raise. Went to my boss as soon as I got that offer, gave him the info he needed to make a counter-offer & went back to work.2 hours later he called me into his office. I should preface this with my (former) boss is not a very personable man, at least not to anyone who isn't also a man over 35yo. Boss got my name right about 80% of the time & obviously didn't know jackshit about me, let alone what I did/do to keep ""Business, Inc."" operational (he admitted this to me out loud)Before giving me a number (counter-offer), he tried to talk me out of it and it was the weirdest interaction I ever had with him. What follows is - to the best of my ability - what I remember him saying:"
[WI] Is There ANY Way This Isn‚Äôt Sabotage by My Employer?,"Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ I think I just busted my company deleting emails and setting me up.I am asking you fine folks the probability that this company is indeed this dumb, and if NOT, what other scenario could explain the circumstances?   I‚Äôm only going to put forth the relevant facts to keep it simple‚Ä¶I have been engaging with my employer & HR on a complex issue most of the year. It got to a point a few months ago where both of us needed to consult w/ legal persons essentially to ensure everything was above board. This resulted in me filing a complaint with a governmental agency, which is being ‚Äúreviewed‚Äù.This is not anything I am ‚Äúat fault‚Äù for, meaning I didn‚Äôt violate the terms of my employment or need disciplinary action.   I have remained in contact with HR and been transparent & responded to every communication and request. I have not involved any legal counsel as I have not needed to take that step. I do have a lawyer advising me until there is true need for them to intervene.Today I received notice from the HR person I‚Äôve been dealing with that they did not receive a requested communication & update from me and as a result needed to take action since I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt comply‚Äù.  I did, in fact, comply, and immediately panicked that ‚Äúsomething‚Äù had gone wrong and my email wasn‚Äôt sent or perhaps I thought I did but only saved a draft. It was nowhere to be found on my company email. It wasn‚Äôt even in the special archive folder I had set up for HR correspondence in which I saved EVERYTHING.Thanks to my diligence in record keeping, and as a CYA Master, I have a printed copy of that email. I was relieved to also find a digital copy in an online database, like a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù if you will, in which our company emails are archived for 5+ years, even if deleted from Outlook. I use it often because most items are set to automatically delete at periods set by the company that we cannot change. For example, anything in the deleted folder gets ‚Äúdeleted-deleted‚Äù after 14 days, items in the sent folder after 6 weeks, etc. unless we specifically set a rule for an email or folder to retain it. I do know that this ‚Äúcloud‚Äù database is not widely known among employees, because often I will procure something thought to be lost and asked how I found it, and then am told ‚Äúwow- I didn‚Äôt know we had that‚Äù.The email is in this archive. In the properties I see time stamps of when it was sent and received.I have no explanation as to how only this email disappeared from my sent folder AND the folder I saved it to. All emails before and after this one sent that day remain.   I am trying to remain optimistic that this isn‚Äôt something nefarious. This is a very large organization, federally regulated in fact, and I can‚Äôt comprehend the reasoning for this email to disappear while they‚Äôre being investigated? Does HR not realize we have this archive? What should I do? I‚Äôm in shock."
Pre- Check Pre Adverse Action [PA],"I was so excited to start my new job with a nice salary increase this coming Monday.

With that all being said I do have a background, I got a DUI 8 years ago when I was in active addiction. I have 8 years sober now and have had really great jobs since.

[CA] Moved from CA to TX and loosing my vacation days,Hey all! I'm hoping someone out there can help me figure this out. I worked in CA for 6 years and accrued 25+ vacation days when I accepted a remote position for the same company (that operates in different states) and moved to TX. It's the end of the year soon and I was told that my vacation days that I accrued in CA cannot carry over in TX and will be lost if I don't use it. I tried to take all of them before the end of the year but my manager isn't giving me more than 10 days vacation as we have a project deadline and I'm leaving the team in Jan. HR is only offering to carry forward 5 days but I stand to loose the rest. No one is budging to accommodate my situation and I'm pissed.I read that vacation days earned in CA is the same as wages earned and stay forever until I quit the company. I'm not sure how this law translates if I move between states. Looking for any advise.
[WV] First Advantage Background Check Help,"I have a background check with First Advantage.For one employment verification they are asking for a W-2, IRS Wage Statement and Paystub.First, the online version of the IRS Wage Statement literally says on the IRS website that the online version of this form is not to be used for 3rd party verification. This means the only option is mailing it which can take 5-10 days. Second, this form has all of my personal tax data so I don‚Äôt even want to give it since all of the staff I have dealt with in First Advantage seems to be outside the USA.The other issue is that this position isn‚Äôt W-2, it was 1099 and I don‚Äôt have an option for this upload.Two questions;How does First Advantage verify these forms with the IRS? Are they able to pull my IRS data?Do they really need all of this or can one form be sufficient to verify my employment?"
[CA] LOA- How are health care provider forms verified? What can I do? Am I at the mercy of my employer?,"My 5yo developed a medical condition. I had a phone appointment with her doctor and after describing it, her doctor determined that it could only be one thing, and that she would need surgery to correct it. The doc informed me that there is a good chance they will want to do the surgery same/next-day when we meet the surgeon.My employer, due to staffing shortages and the holiday season would not grant me use of my vacation time, and I have used all my sick time for the year. The day of the appointment with the surgeon I began a family care LOA. After meeting with the surgeon he told us his scheduling person would call us in the next 48 hours to schedule the surgery. When the scheduler called 3 days later, they told me the doctor noticed she had cold symptoms so he wanted to push the surgery to December since the surgery was not as urgent as they originally suspected. So now it has been 5 days  since I started my LOA.When I gave the office my health care provider certification form, they basically told me the doctor was not going to sign it, but that he would write a doctors note (which my employer will not accept.)A woman who worked in the office felt bad for my situation and offered to sign the paperwork herself, but she was just a secretary.  If I have her sign the paperwork, what are the chances my employer will or will not accept it. What are my options? do I have any? Im scared im going to lose my job if they deny my LOA and apply the attendance policy.[edit]  I am full time, been employed for over 2 years, and the forms provided to me by hr are for FMLA. In this was the healthcare provider certification.(which I was told my doctor will not sign, and I already refused the doctors note. my plan was to ask  one of the nurses to sign it the day of the surgery.)Im concerned that if I do not provide them with the certification they will deny the LOA. Or can they do that, since I qualify for FMLA?"

"[NY] Asked for a raise, got a retention bonus. How should I feel?","I was promoted to manager-level at my company about 6 months ago, and since, I‚Äôve literally had 4 bosses (VP level) leave the company. I‚Äôve weathered the storm and have taken on a significant amount of their responsibilities - the company leadership has routinely noted that I‚Äôve ‚Äústepped up and taken on a lot‚Äù and I‚Äôve gotten consistent strong performance reviews.Since I‚Äôve taken on so much responsibility (the bosses roles were never backfilled) and have had visibility with leadership, I decided to ask for a 15% pay raise. After a few weeks, I heard back from my new boss and HR that they are not giving me a raise, but instead a retention bonus equal to roughly 1-year of the size raise that I requested. Part of the bonus is paid immediately, and part in 6 months.I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to feel about this, but the more I think about it, I feel like I‚Äôm not getting a great deal since my salary baseline for future growth did not increase. It definitely is nice to get a bonus, but isn‚Äôt the long-term benefit that a raise would be.Can anyone shed some light on why the company may have approached it this way. Am I right to feel a little pissed?"

[CAN-ON] Importance of Job Titles,"As I've asked this subreddit before, I'm gunning for a significant raise with my current employer. Part of that will likely entail a change in job title. I normally think job titles are silly, but I'm also realizing that it helps to titles reflective of the role when it comes to job searching (not that I'm in the market but you never know).I'm currently the only person in a role/department that was essentially created just for me. My role and duties are essentially very senior-/executive-level duties, despite a job title that is VERY junior sounding. Any change in title is going to a promotion in name only as it won't change my duties at all.Besides looking good in the event I'm job searching again, what are other ways/reasons that my employer could benefit from giving me a more senior title?"

[WI] Boss Trying to Take Away 40hr Work Week Limitation - Can We Do Anything?,"Hello,My partner works for a large corporation that regularly assigns crazy amounts of mandatory overtime to its employees, especially given how short staffed they've become (in no small part because of this crazy overtime).A few months ago my partner started seeing a therapist (masters not a doctorate) who provided him with a written note suggesting he be limited to 40hrs for mental/emotional reasons such as PTSD. His employer honored this for several months, and only required the note be renewed every few months or so.As his partner I can promise you that this limitation has drastically improved his mental/emotional/physical state. He's no loner in constant pain, he's no longer got explosive anger issues, he's got the energy to live his life again. Its difficult to put into words, but he's much better, and this is the only solace he finds in his current job.Today he was handed a form requiring a physician's list of limitations, and is required to complete it by December 1st (which is too short of time to get in an appointment with his therapist currently). He's panicking because his limitation comes from his therapist, not a physician.My question is what is the logical next step for a company where their HR has been entirely unhelpful? Can they legally require new standards in this short of a time frame? Can the therapist list his limitations in place of a physician? I intend to look over the form tonight, but I feel like something here is fishy and I'd like to do anything I can to make sure my partner doesn't have to go back to the constant and unyielding stress that was tearing out relationship apart at the seams."
[UK] My toxic employer has been bullying me and I don‚Äôt know how to get time off to interview for other jobs,"Background story: My employer has had an issue with me for day dot, to the point other employees have picked up on it.

I‚Äôve also witnessed my manager be passive aggressive with methadone users because she knows she can get away with it and make other comments about patients walking out such as ‚Äúshe reminds me of a prostitute‚Äù.Another pharmacist brought the way I was being treated to the attention of the district manager who replied ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing I can do until the employee comes forward‚Äù and handed my manager a bunch of flowers a few days later for her 10 year service with the company. The managers are so cliquey so if I speak up everyone will know, my manager tells everyone‚Äôs business to anyone she can gossip to and the same goes for all the store managers in the surrounding areas.My mental health has completely crumbled and I no longer feel confident after after getting put down for so long.

[TX] My boss is ghosting me after an interaction with a new employee.,"I work as a training coordinator for various customer service positions at a small, web based B2B operation.  Last week, we brought in a new employee that has been extremely difficult to train. We‚Äôre all remote employees, but she thought the online training sessions were hard to follow and the training guide wasn‚Äôt helpful for her.I offered to spend a couple days in our actual office with her, but my boss thought she would be fine training with me at my house. I thought that was a strange suggestion and should have said no, but I didn‚Äôt want to press to go into the office (and the new hire said she would rather go to my house) so I agreed.She spent about half a work day here and left early due to a headache. We got very little accomplished. She said she read the guide and she seemed to be listening, but she just wasn‚Äôt retaining anything.The next day, I emailed my boss with my thoughts and suggested some other strategies we could try (short training videos, demo web pages etc.) My boss replied very curtly, stating that the new hire didn‚Äôt find the environment at my home conducive to learning, so she would be training her personally, in-office.I replied, asking what she meant. I can‚Äôt think of anything that would warrant a statement like that, but I‚Äôm happy to address and correct any potential problems with my job performance, if that was part of the issue.My boss did not, and has not responded. Not to that email or any of the others I‚Äôve sent regarding other things in the last 3 days.  She hasn‚Äôt even responded to a PTO request I put in for the end of the month.I can‚Äôt think of anything I did that would warrant this kind of reaction from her. We‚Äôve had a great working relationship for years. I have no idea what this new hire said to her and I‚Äôm hurt that she didn‚Äôt check with me for my side of whatever story was told.We don‚Äôt have an in-house HR, really - the HR dept we report to is at our corporate office and we don‚Äôt know them well so I‚Äôm hesitant to reach out. But I have no idea how to resolve this with my boss or with the new hire. Please help."
[TX] Company Equipment,"A year ago I left a remote job. They sent me an email regarding returning equipment, I emailed them back twice asking for them to send me a return label. Nobody ever got back to me. So the equipment just sat in my storage closet all this time. Well I recently moved, I was sick with Covid so my partner and family did most of the moving. I just waited at our new place while they moved everything and packed it. Well I just realized that the equipment was left in the storage closet in our old place. I have no idea what the apartment complex has done with it. I am going to call them in the morning but I doubt they would have kept it. I‚Äôm really worried of getting in trouble for that equipment.I don‚Äôt care to keep it nor would I ever intentionally withhold it either. The company has not reached out to me in the last year, but still. What if they do? The equipment is now essentially lost. I am not sure what to do and I am so stressed about it.

[NE] Discrimination??,"I worked at Walmart and after being approved for an ADA Accommodation Claim for my mental illness, through Sedgwick. Walmart had me marked for 3 absences in one day.

BAD SMELLS [CA],"There‚Äôs a terrible smell coming from the soda fountain area at my job. Sometimes it gets so bad the employees get headaches, but worst of all is constantly having customers complaining at you about the smells in the store. We‚Äôve talked to management about it and they‚Äôve done all the steps in their power to solve this issue. Ie: send out a maintenance report to corporate which then sends out the assigned technician for our store to check out the issue. Sometimes we do it multiple times a week but this usually always result in them testing out our equipment saying there‚Äôs nothing wrong and marking it off as fixed. Some days it‚Äôs worse than others but it‚Äôs getting to me, when I have 20+ customers complaining about the same thing that caused my headache for the day. Where do I even start, is this something I can even complain about, when my manager has done everything by the rule book and it‚Äôs gotten us no where. It seems like a deeper issue than just the soda fountain, which I don‚Äôt understand why the company refuses to drop a penny in actually finding the root of the problem."

[TX] my ex acting a fool... help?,"Long story short, my(27f) ex(30m) is working under me and I let him control the narrative that we just know each other from high school (we did not end in good terms, but I'm waaay over all that). I got coworkers of him coming to me complaining about his behavior. I've tried my best to never influence anybody else's opinion, as of recent he is getting in trouble also with other supervisors (from insubordination, to getting called out for sexist comments). I do my due diligence by passing over any complaints to higher ups, just reporting as it goes... my question is tied to him being super petty and one to hold grudges. Should I come clear with hr about the nature of our past relationship before shit hits the fan? I was keeping our past relationship a secret so it wouldn't negatively affect him, (not knowing he was a grade A ahole to others too, apparently). Now I am concerned how all this will play out because I do not trust him not to say something completely out of pocket, would me withholding that kind of information be detrimental to me in any way?"
Philosophical differences between manager and HRBP [TN],"I'm a manager in a call center environment.We have an occurrence/point attendance policy that follows a typical progressive corrective action process if violated (X number of points accrued is a first reminder, Y number of points is a second reminder and so on). We also have a policy around monthly performance expectations.I was working with my HRBP seeking to term an agent for a specific egregious offense, for which the company has termed in the past. I happened to mention that this agent also had a history of performance and attendance problems (and on corrective action for both) with my point basically being that this is not a great employee and the company is better off without them. My HRBP and I then had an intense conversation about bias and how that can't come into play when making these types of decisions, etc. We ended up terming the employee due to the egregious offense.But how is it bias if I, as a manager, am looking overall at this agent and have documentation and metrics showing me that they aren't producing for the company? What if we take out the ""egregious offense"" and just had an agent with multiple corrective actions, bad attitude and not a team player? I would not have my HRBP support in seeking to separate that employee from the company, with their explanation that it puts the company at risk.It just feels like my HR team would rather have operations hang on to poor performers and bad cultural fits just to avoid the chance that someone might sue or file for unemployment.I dont want to create risk for the company when making operational decisions, so I often heed my HRBP advice, even if I really struggle to agree with it. As a manager, I feel that sometimes a judgment call is necessary, whereas HR says you basically have to treat everyone the same no matter the circumstances.Am I really in the wrong for my way of thinking, or is my HRBP too rigid in their recommendations?"
[MO] I accepted an offer last week and now wish to move forward with a different position in the same company. What should I do?,"On 11/2 I accepted a position with a local university here in town. I had interviewed for another position as well, that committee members were aware of, as they interviewed me for both. Thing is, today I got a call saying they‚Äôd like to offer the other position as well. This one was my #1 choice and I of course was ecstatic to here this. But now HR is saying that I can‚Äôt accept that one since I am considered an employee and would have to have a 6 month probationary period before moving to a different department. But I haven‚Äôt even had my first day yet. I reached out to HR to see if there is any recourse here or if I‚Äôm stuck with accepting the first position. I of course am grateful for the one I accepted but the other position comes with a 10k/yr salary difference which is not chump change for my family.Have any of you been through something similar? Any advice?"
"[TX] got a job offer and received a Fair Credit Reporting Act 613 noticed, what exactly does that mean ?","So I applied to work at a warehouse and got offered the job.

Attendance policy legal question [OH],"A company is in the process of changing its Covid policy. Here is some relevant info:The attendance policy is no-fault, as in points accrue regardless of doctor visits vs just staying home on one's own assessment of illness.The Covid policy remains that the company's HR team is telling a worker who tests positive for Covid that they must stay away for 5 calendar days after their positive test.Until now, there was a Covid exception to our point system, specifically a Covid diagnosis did NOT accrue points. No documentation was needed, just the employee's word.Under the new policy, Covid absences are pointed unless the employee gets FMLA paperwork from their doctor.My questions are:If the company MANDATES the 5-days-away policy, can it also write up the employee for attendance violations based on those points accruing? Would this run afoul of any labor protections or laws?Does the policy create a motivation for an employee to lie? For example, if a worker calls out with the flu, they can return to work within 24 hours of symptoms going away. So a worker with no PTO hours left has a financial motivation to hide a Covid diagnosis.Thanks!"

New benefits package isn‚Äôt great. Should I provide feedback? [WA],"My employer (medium-small nonprofit) has announced a new benefits package for next year. On the surface it looks okay but the problem is the medical benefit caps care after certain thresholds are reached and then out-of-pocket or coinsurance kicks in. For the average person this probably won‚Äôt be a problem but for someone with a chronic health condition (like me), it is going to be significantly more expensive than the previous package.I don‚Äôt expect them to change anything this year and I do understand that rates are going up and my employer is trying to adjust‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth providing feedback that this is a hardship for me. I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm whining but I do think that if enough people provide similar feedback they might take it seriously and look for something better next year."
[MA] How can I deal with an insubordinate employee who is older than me?,"How can I deal with an insubordinate employee who is older than me?I am the assistant manager for the record. I have an older barista at the coffee shop I work at who refuses to listen to me. I will ask her to do something like take out the trash she will grab the barrel then spend 20 minutes sweeping the floors, another few minutes wiping down tables, then she will take out the trash. The issue I have with this is she has been told multiple times the trash barrel cannot be left outside the backdoor for more than a few minutes or we get a fine from the building for breaking fire code.She has been taught multiple times on how to make beverages to company standard, she will for the next drink or so do it correctly then immediately reverts back to how she has decided how to do it.She also sort of tells me to do things in a bossy manner like 'I am old I know better than you'. Like if she is taking one customer she will tell me to take the next one when they have told her they are ordering together.There is also an issue with her not washing her hands unless she has to use the bathroom but that's more of a health code thing.She has been here two months already and is not grasping the job at the pace we need her. She is still struggling with making the basics like lattes and cappuccinos and has just tuned any of us out unless its our boss telling her otherwise. My boss is here 1-2 days a week because she is also managing the neighboring store and they are 10 times busier than us and need more attention. (Corporate's decision not hers). So I am left in charge most days and am at a loss at what to do. Should I reach out to HR or should I try to talk to my boss about this?Edit:To clear up some things mentioned in the comments. I mention her age because I feel she is using it to justify why she shouldn't listen to anyone as if we are her kids or something. She listens to our boss probably because our boss hired her and help train her.The hand washing thing is I observe her wiping her face or nose in her hands and resume working. I ask her to wash her hands please and she just rinses them under the faucet for like 10 seconds or less then dries them.I do not sit there and breathe down her neck but when customers complain their drink was made wrong or she prepares the espresso first leaving the shots out to get cold before even putting milk in the steaming pitcher I have to remind her of the standard."
"[AZ] Possibility of Getting Current Employer to Match an Offer from a Competitor, During a Hiring Freeze?","Education/Experience: US-based Chemical/Mat Sci Engineer (Master's) w/ 5 years of Experience in Process Engineeringtl;dr: From HR's perspective, could my current (Fortune 50) employer be able to match an external offer (+16% base pay) when there is a hiring freeze (and potential layoffs) at current company?I enjoy my current role, work-life balance, and colleagues/manager. I've been at the same Fortune 50 company since graduation, and despite promotions believe I'm being a bit  underpaid, but not drastically. However, Current Company has announced some layoffs will be coming, but current word is that my department will not be affected. Even if I don't get laid off, I doubt a significant raise will come at next year's performance review so I won't see a salary raise in the near future.Context on external offer:Former manager, who left Current Company years ago, reached out asking if I wanted to interview for similar role at local competitor company under him. I have received an offer for +16% base pay with a nice signing bonus, but based on the interview the work/life balance will be noticeably worse (1 wfh day vs 3, significantly more on-call time on nights/weekends until I engineer the issues away)In an ideal world, I'd ask my Current Company to match the base pay increase but I'm unsure if my manager would be able to, given the circumstances. And if I ask but don't receive it, if it will add a negative mark in the eyes of my current company. I will say that since I only have a Master's, and most of my colleagues have a PhD, I'm a lower grade level (even newer ones that I'm training, and I have more responsibility than many of the PhDs who have 1-2 years experience). So I'm one of the cheaper employees in my group of ~15 and my manager and his manager both really like me.Does anyone have any insight to this situation; asking for current company to match an external offer (+16% base pay), when there is a hiring freeze at current company?"
[TX] Do I Have Any Recourse?,"I work in Texas. I have a coworker who has Narcolepsy. She sleeps at her desk quite often. She seems to perk right up when it's time to eat or clock out or play around on the internet, but is sound asleep when actual work needs to be done. This company is small. 4 people including the boss. She is also a family friend of the owner.Our HR department only handles payroll. If we have serious issues that require HR's attention, she tells us to talk to the owner who in turn, gets hostile that HR was involved. I have seen this in the past, so I am reluctant to go to HR.My issue is with her workload being dumped on me while she snoozes. I am doing her job and mine and only being paid for mine. My boss makes accommodations for her and gets really hostile when anyone mentions anything about her screwing around on the web and sleeping.We now work from home but it is evident that she is not working, at all. My boss will not confront  her but will yell at me if her work isn't done in a timely manner.I am certain I have zero recourse and should probably find another job if I want anything to change. I just thought I would ask here as well."

[WA] How do I collect evidence for a hostile workspace investigation when I haven't been recording conversations and taking a lot of notes over the last year?,A stakeholder from a different team reported my manager for creating a hostile work environment. HR reached out to me and seems to be taking it seriously. Reactions and comments the investigator made as I responded to questions and shared my experience made it sound like there is a case to be made. The investigator asked for more corroborating witnesses and as it's fairly large company so there are people on other teams who won't be intimidated by my manager. The investigator asked me to provide whatever evidence I have but I was pretty gaslit for a while and wasn't thinking of making recordings or taking copoius notes so I'm struggling a bit right now to get this process started and wondered if anyone here might have some advice.

[CA] [BE] Best Way to Hire a Legal Remote Employee Abroad,"Hello All!We are a US based company (California) that has been working with a contractor through Upwork for the past couple months now.

This isn't a job any person can do.Want them on our payroll as a US company, but the meet all the tax requirements of Belgium.I realize that Upwork has a way to make them an Employee in accordance to all local laws, but the fees are pretty astronomical (Example, if base salary is $3k, company pays a total of $5k in salary + fees)  Much rather use the fees towards a higher base salary for the employee.Are there any other HR/Payroll websites/programs out there that could help us hire this employee in a more official capacity?

[TX] I TIFU by having a typo on my resume dates,"Hello, so I applied to a job and they wanted to do some employment verification. The only issue is I realized after I sent my resume in that one of the ""jobs"" I had listed on my employment history had incorrect dates. This was an UNPAID volunteer role that I took in college so that I could have some sort of experience on my resume. The issue is, I only worked this role from September 2019 to December 2019. On my resume I made the mistake of saying I held this role from September 2019 to December 2020. Once I realized this mistake, I resent an edited resume. Another note, I also mispelled the name of the place I worked so it further backs up my argument that this was a mistake. I had already received an offer for this job and I am pending a background check. My question is, will this be an issue as the employer may think that I am being dishonest?"
Advice on how to tell a brand new employer I am 5 months pregnant? [CA],"In California, but the company offers 12 weeks of paid leave across all locations. This is the best job I've ever had and the first with full benefits. I was told my interview stood out over the last year. I feel like I am about to be a big disappointment or that I am letting them down.It's a tech company with 500+ employees. I joined this week in a sales role, and will only be fully ramped for 1 month before my due date. I am 5 months pregnant so obviously, I don't have a lot of time to wait before letting them know.I don't get assigned my permanent team and manager until the end of week2/start of week 3. Initially, I wanted to wait and build up some goodwill but now I think I should let them know ASAP so they can put me on a team where there might be some more flexibility. My first 1:1 is tomorrow - day 3 of work.Questions:Is tomorrow too soon to tell them? I worry about waiting since I don't know when their internal assignments begin.Should I apologize? Offer to take the leave unpaid (especially because I'd like to be off longer than 12 weeks)?What's the best way to phrase things as I let them know? I want them to know I am committed to the org and plan to grow with them, take ownership of re-onboarding myself before I return from leave, and plan to work hard.Thanks in advance - I have never been in this position before."

[TX] Is it weird for myself M(21) to be creeped out/feel uncomfortable because of a older guys behavior,"Please Read before commenting. I‚Äôve been a victim of blatant sexual harassment and physical advances before and I know this is not the same situation. No one ever handled my previous case seriously or cared for what everyone saw in plain view. Im just looking for a base course of action to take before something might possibly happen again.Context is important. I Work for a construction contractor who is currently employed by a hospital to do some retrofit work. I spend a lot of time in a central operations plant waiting on a contractor that my company employs. I have a workstation/desk in this room where I often converse with hospital employed maintenance. Myself, and them often have good banter. However, the past couple of days they have a new guy working in the plant. He is older, at least 50+ who was sitting next to me for a couple days. At first he seemed nice, and friendly. Then he‚Äôd randomly start talking to me while I was working about the most random of topics some sentences not even making sense at all. He has also told me ‚Äústories about back in my day‚Äù but it seems like he‚Äôs trying to convince me he was cool or a ladies man from his ‚Äúclubbing days‚Äù. Then I noticed him on multiple occasions peeking over my shoulder to see what I was doing on my phone. Now when he is supposed to be monitoring a plant that is crucial to the functionality of this hospital. He‚Äôll leave his station and come sit at my table in the break room and again start his conversations about random topics. Like I said, we often have banter but no one really invades each other‚Äôs personal space, or asks personal questions, except this guy. I‚Äôve made a point to sit away from him due to his spouting off random shit to me that literally don‚Äôt make sense. Now, he‚Äôs moved stations right next to where I‚Äôm sitting again, creeping over my should when I‚Äôm on my phone(there is a lot of downtime so being on my phone is not negligent). I understand none of this is blatant behavior but the guy is just weird and I feel uncomfortable with the guy being near me.He hasn‚Äôt said anything that crosses a line, nor has he made any physical advancements towards me. I just get that super creepy feeling. I‚Äôm not a small guy, and Ive had gut feelings about people before but this guy is just creepy.What should I do?Edit: I‚Äôve also been a victim of blatant sexual harassment and physical advancements before in the workplace. Maybe that plays a role in my feeling creeped out?"

HR specified in the itinerary that the company would reimburse me after the interview, granted I provide a receipt.

[NV] I need desperate help with talking to my boss. Sorry this might be a little long. But I really need HELP.,"Technically (NV) and (PA) My problem is my boss is insisting on booking all of my hotel rooms himself. Mainly so he can receive all the rewards points. For his stay and mine. Plus my other co-worker.Little background I am F(39), my co-worker is also F(40-50) and our boss M(40-50). Also I am new to the corporate life and want to know how to handle myself in these situations.First trip he booked the rooms whatever right. I thought it was weird. When I got to the hotel I changed the room to only under my name and took his off. Then added my rewards account to the room. Took a little convincing with the front desk but when I told them our company paid they had no issue. When we got back from that trip. He made a comment to me. Telling me to not do that. He needs to get all the points on his (not our company, his personal) rewards account. Due to the fact he needs the points and status to book upgrades for anyone our company is hosting. In whatever area we are sending them to.I didn‚Äôt argue but was upset by the whole thing and weirded out. So This past trip when I check in it‚Äôs all under his name and not mine. I have to use his last name to login into the wifi and all. Before my co-worker and I got there he texted us saying he checked us in and sent a picture of our different room keys. To come to his room and get it from him. Then he said never mind get it at the front desk.During the trip, I realized he had been in my room. Before I got there. Cause of things he said, the air conditioner was broke in the room and he seemed to know. All of this put me over the edge and really creeped me out.My question is how do I approach him. To say I need to book my own room. I am a female traveling alone and need to be safe. I know he is probably going to get upset and I need to be ready. Plus I‚Äôd love to call him out on this points non-sense. He doesn‚Äôt need them and I always thought that was a bonus of traveling for work. I think he is trying to take advantage of my inexperience in these situations and I am on to him. Like I‚Äôm not stupid dude. I know you can just book a better room for anyone we are hosting. The company can afford it and you are not paying for it.I just want to also say, as creepy as it all sounds. I know he would never come at me sexually. He knows my husband very well and I don‚Äôt think would ever cross that line.Any and all advice is so welcome and would be super helpful. Thank you I‚Äôm advance.

Looking for advise for my resume [AZ],"Hello,For the past 3 years I‚Äôve been a mortgage loan officer with 3 different companies until I left my job in march.Since June, I‚Äôve been holding my license with a new mortgage company but have no done any work for them at all so far, but I‚Äôm technically an employee. They basically have me on standby incase I meet someone who needs a mortgage.I got hired at the investment firm Vanguard in August but I failed the licensing exam by a few questions and lost my employment last week.I have no clue what I‚Äôm going to do for a job but im concerned if I should even put vanguard on my resume since I only worked there for two months and would have to explain to a new employer I got fired because I failed the test.I feel it may look bad that my last couple years have been hopping around at multiple companies with gaps in my employment.Should I even put the mortgage company I‚Äôve been at since June even though I haven‚Äôt done a single hour of work for them?Im really lost and stressed about this.Any tips would be appreciated"

[PA] Sign On Bonus - Leaving Company,"My official start date with my current company is December 13, 2021. I am going to notify that my last day will be EOD December 14, 2022.Per the language in my offer letter, the company has no legal standing to in regards to asking for the sign-on money back - right?It is agreed that the Company will pay you a one-time sign-on bonus (hereinafter the ‚ÄúSigning Bonus‚Äù) in the amount of $X less required tax withholdings and authorized deductions.

[TX] How do I prove workplace harassment/discrimination?,"I have dates for some events, and the boss is treating most of the staff this way, but she is buddy buddy with HR and emails her almost constantly. I am afraid HR will take her side when I present my case, and I feel almost every employee is afraid to expose her but she is awful.She recently told an employee to sell herself to male customers to sell product.

[TX] Feeling weird about my most recent contract to hire position/Interview,"So I started this new job on 09/17/22 and its a contract to hire position with a three month contract. During this time I feel as if Ive really excelled in the position and gained valuable insight in the industry. I was apart of a mass hiring for my specific department, I was brought in with 5 other people(4 of which were contractors, the other full time). 2 of the 4 contractors have already quit and I have about two weeks left on my contract. I applied through a recruiting agency while the full timer applied directly through the company website.I am a little peeved at the recruiting agency because I mentioned at the start how I did not want to be a contractor for this position. I had previous experience in this type of work but not the same industry. The recruiting agency told me that it was the only thing X company I work at was willing to do at the time. Then 2 weeks later they hire a full timer. I got lied to. I was also supposed to have 6 people on my interview call and just had 2. The full timer has let some details loose about his interview process and tells me he was given a skills assessment test which I was never given. The full timer also doesn't have much more experience than I do. 9 months at one job for bookkeeping/accounting. I have 9 months split between two different jobs.Im really struggling to understand why I was treated this way in the interview process, all things considered. Ive told upper management I would like to stay/ go full time and stop the bleeding of the cycle of contractors coming in and out. Im confused, angry, and starting to loose faith. Could anyone out there give me some advice?"

"[CA] Work forcing me to use the term ""master bedroom""","Hello! I work in marketing for a property management company in California. A couple of months ago I brought to my boss' attention that it may be a good idea to shift our language from ""master bedroom"" to ""primary bedroom"" (or something similar) because, over the last few years, this has become an industry standard and it feels like we are one of the last to stay up on this. It doesn't take much thinking to realize why ""master bedroom"" is a pretty offensive term. Feels like an easy fix. My boss agreed, and I began using the term in social media posts, etc. A couple of weeks ago, my boss came up to me and said that the owners of the company noticed that I had began using the word ""primary"" and that they would like me to stop because they ""like to stay neutral in political situations.""My blood was boiling and no part of this feels political to me. I am wondering if there is any kind of discrimination/rights that I have in this situation, as I now feel highly uncomfortable using the phrase in my everyday work. To me, the term feels so blatantly racist and/or sexist. Any input/help appreciated! Thank you."
[UK] Fixed-term redundancy - almost 4 years of employment,"I worked fixed-term since early Jan 2019, covering position of a permanent employee who worked in another department. That person got fully transferred to that department in August 2022. However my position wasn't advertised (so I can become permanent) and I was kept on fixed-term still. This week I was told I am being made redundant because there is no longer enough work in the team and they don't need me. My current contract expires on end of December 2022. I am 7 days short to full 4 years of employment.I understand that if I worked those 7 days I would have automatically become a permanent employee, according to UK law. I am however happy to leave as the workplace is toxic. I am offered a redundancy payment of 3 years. Can I ask for redundancy payment of 4 years? I would have worked for employer for 3 years 11 months and 3 weeks at the end of my contract.Now, some backstory - my line manager was bullied by her manager for the last year and a half. This was reported to HR multiple times, but nothing was done, as the person worked in the organisation for more than 30 years and has connections. My line manager believes there is plenty of work in the department and there is no reason for me to go, and that she will struggle to run a team without me. My line manager was excluded from the decision making process completely, and she didn't know I am being made redundant until I told her so, and she was shocked and upset she wasn't even told.In the letter from HR they don't list reasons for this - simply say you contract ends and here is the money.The question: can I get a 4 year redundancy payment (instead of 3) and what else do they owe me? Or should I not bother and just take money and leave?"
Starting an Employee resource Group (ERG) at a Small Company? [GA],"Hello, I am not in HR, but I would like to help with the diversity,equity,and inclusion initiative at an organization I just joined. I used to work for a large company who had an employee resource group (ERG) for every category you could imagine (LGBTQ+, women, etc), but the organization I have joined has just a little over 100 employees, so I understand that's not entirely feasible here. I can see that they seem a little lost on how to promote diversity&inclusion, and they don't really seem to have anything in place, but a blurb on the monthly newsletter if it's black history month, for example. There's not anything for me to ""join"" really.From talking with other minorities in the company, I can tell they are also unhappy with the lack of support/action. It seems that the company went on a diversity hire spree, but once we became employees, there was not really anything for us. I would really like to provide some insight, but unsure where to start. There is one HR lady who runs the initiative, so I don't want to step on any toes, especially as a new hire.Any tips on how to start/organize an ERG for a small company or how to bring up my ideas to my superiors?"

can I be fired for dating a coworkers ex? [CA],"Hello, I believe there is a chance I may be fired on Monday from my Job. I have been in a relationship with a girl for over 2 years now, come to find out, she is an ex-girlfriend of one of my coworkers who is best friends with my boss. The coworker knows about it and is furious with me, I denied it because I want to keep my work and private life Seperate. Well, ever since I've denied it, my boss makes jokes about it after I've told him I am uncomfortable, uses the story to make his business partners laugh, even has a ""steal yo girl"" jar in the office he puts money into whenever he talks about the situation. This weekend, a coworker that is aware I have denied the claim met my sister at her workplace and she divulged that I am indeed in a relationship with my coworkers ex. I have a strong feeling I will be retaliated against and even possibly fired, although, my boss is very wealthy and can hire a lawyer if I wanted to do anything about it. He also could very well lie and make up a reason for firing me other than this situation, but he is absolutely the type of person to do that. What can I even do? I am in California, and multiple times I have asked him to drop the subject to no avail. Am I pretty much out of luck because I'm in an at-will state? Any advice/help is appreciated."

[WA] Tried to tell HR I was being sexually harassed but they kept interrupting/shutting down the conversation,"I met with my organization's HR rep in a private meeting. I had rehearsed what I wanted to say about what I had experienced: consistent and serious forms of sexual harrassment by someone in the organization with more power than I, as well as bulling and threats by employees senior to me. There is also a heavy ""don't make the organization look bad"" and surveillance culture. It was actually impossible to record or document my harrassment as evidence because workers are not allowed to have phones or to carry anything out of our workspaces. I really did not want to make waves, I just wanted the abuses to stop.Every time I tried to talk, my HR rep would inturrupt me and try to redirect or minimize what I was saying. Every time I tried to continue, they'd do this again. I got very frustrated and started crying. When I did, they said, ""I see no reason why you should be crying.""I felt completely powerlessness and it was as though my brain shut down. I quit soon after.More than what I should have done, I really just want to know what HR rep's strategy was. It seems they they were already prepared with this judo-like strategy before I entered the room. Is this a common HR way to ""handle""/supress complaints?Thank you for your thoughts"
[UK] Can my manager assign me one off tasks that I struggle with?,"I work in a role which has had no customer interaction during my 8 years of employment, neither has any other team member.After a recent occupational health report, it explained I have difficulties with social aspects, to a point of current medication changes causing worsening side effects and OH suggesting home working (we all have been working from home for the last 5 years anyway).Last week my manager assigned me to be part of a call with a customer, I mentioned that it would be something I would have difficulty with and asked if this could be assigned to someone else. I was told I would not have to communicate directly with the customer (just to control a screen share software).When this call actually happened I was thrown into leading the call and it was not a comftable or good experience.I feel this should not have happened as the short task could have been done by another team member, but am not sure if an employer should take my difficulties (which OH said amounts to a disability) into account when assigning abnormal one off tasks?"

[TX] Should I ask for an updated job description?,"I recently transitioned into a product manager role within a new department in a completely different division. It leverages my background well and gives me room to grow - I build strategy around software tech, marketing, sales, etc. I love it because I‚Äôve always wanted to be in strategy. However, this group was only formed this year and staffs a lot of prior software/electrical engineers as other PM‚Äôs which carried over their job band - I‚Äôm technically a mechanical engineer, so this helped boost my salary as an internal transfer.Here‚Äôs the problem: this division does several org changes a year (it‚Äôs basically a start up getting its legs within a very big company) and I got a heads up that parts of my job will likely be spread across other groups, leaving me to think my role is going to change completely. Since nothing has been made official I‚Äôm just carrying on until we get the official announcement. I have a gut feeling that I will be put into a technical group (software/electrical) based on some details. If that happens, I‚Äôd like to prepare for some conversation around expectations/performance because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd succeed in this type of role.  How do I go about asking for clarity in my new job (in writing)? The only thing I can think of asking for is an official job description to get expectations in writing. I want to believe there is a business justification with all these org changes and HR would have to be part of that but not sure what my options are."
[UK] Head of HR can't cope with the workload and is slowing down all the processes.,"Context: I manage a small team.

[TN] Job Grade E60?,"Hello, I‚Äôm hoping someone here can help because I‚Äôm not finding ANYTHING on the Google.My (9 year old) job description has my job coded at ‚Äú6959‚Äù and graded at ‚ÄúE60‚Äù.I already know that the job description is wildly outdated as it has never been updated by leadership, but when asking for information from HR about how my salary relates to the job grade, they haven‚Äôt been able to give me any information (although they are trying to do me a favor by looking into it, their hands are tied at a certain point).I realized that the salary range was quite skewed when I hired someone in at $55K/year as an entry level position, but the salary range that HR provided to me for that position was $55K-$75K.

[NY] New boss for less than a day wrote me up to HR right after my boss was fired‚Ä¶,"Need some advice. Monday my boss was fired and they implied it was performance related. They were digging/documenting for anything negative during skip level interviews (was in one). Less than 24 hours after I got a new boss, she emailed myself and HR and laid out several vague performance issues with myself. I Haven‚Äôt worked with this person directly for 5 months (she was my manager prior to that 5 months). When I asked during our 1:1 about specific examples based on the letter, she gave vague responses like it happened several months ago or isn‚Äôt aware of the specific details but will dig to get the details. Seems either she‚Äôs been trying to document any negative thing she can about me during the last several months despite not managing me or a lot of it is fabricated.Yesterday I found out she scheduled skip level interviews with all my direct reports (similar to what they did when my boss was fired). Fully expect to get fired like my boss later in November. She is very close to our CMO and felt she was sent not only to replace my boss but myself also and they made this decision weeks ago. They are just going through this process to fire us and minimize severance payouts. Expect them to give me the news very soon.Trying to best prepare myself for actions I should take when they let me go and what I should or should not sign. Could this be a case of retaliation or anything else? Just feels so odd I would get a negative letter to HR one day after my boss was fired and it seems planned out and I am on the list next.

Work and Home related stress [UK],"I'll preface this by saying this is NOT a post about me going to HR to complain about my boss. I generally like her and when she's not stressed she's very approachable and open to ideas etc.Recently I've been under a lot of work and home stress. My father has a medical problem that is only going to get worse down the line and to be honest has gotten worse. I go to work and work.. and come home and help care for my father. I don't really get a lot of downtime.. this is made worse by the fact I actually never get to leave work on time. There's always so much work on my plate I never feel like I can just.. stop and go home when I'm supposed to otherwise I'll come in the next day to a load of emails asking why such and such hasn't been done and as someone who is trying their hardest and breaking their back doing it... it feels quite demoralising to constantly be picked up on things. Now the real problem at work is the fact I love my job.. but that should be me doing MY job.. instead I'm doing the work of AT LEAST 2 people and occasionally 3.. which is leading to me not enjoying my job. I'm very overworked in the fact someone's gone on maternity cover and work weren't even going to get maternity cover to my knowledge so I had no backup or support in my role (the person on maternity is my senior.. I don't report to them but they're the senior version of my job so I can usually get help with a variety of tasks around the office and they can pick up things I forget or can't get round to and vice versa.) Eventually they've had to as the person will be leaving shortly after their maternity leave has finished. This person isn't starting for another month and I've already been by myself in my role (new to my role, I've only been in the company a few months.) for most of my time there. I'm picking up the job of 2 people and they've got rid of every bit of minor help I did have.. they got a temp in but as he wasn't proactive in doing things they decided they weren't worth keeping on for long, they got rid of daytime security who helped me with a few more physical jobs around the office (the office is HUGE so stocking everywhere up is a really big task..). And one of the team who was around to help me out sometimes is now trialling another role half of the week so won't be around to help me as much. All the small support I did have.. they've got rid of when I was already lacking support anyway unlike the other new receptionist at our sister office who has a senior AND help everyday from someone to get things done around the office..I'm trying not to be angry about it, but I'm new in a job and they've basically taken away all the support I did have and now I'm extremely overworked and I can't even relax when I get home because of my dad. I literally never switch off. I'm sick of getting emails telling me things I've missed or not done.. I feel like I've been set up for failure and everytime I tell my manager I'm stressed I get told I'm a trooper or I'm doing really well.. but then the emails telling me about things I've missed constantly make me feel otherwise. I got upset because I got told off about some fruit being left out for 2 days in a place it shouldn't have been.. when plenty of other people who were in our department walked past the fruit where it was and could have just moved it..?I have scheduled a meeting in with HR to talk about things.. but I want advice on how to approach the whole situation for the best possible outcome. I'm not here to point fingers but I am here to get some serious solutions before I burn out from being overworked due to lack of support in my role.. a lack of support that wasn't there until the past couple of months. I'm so stressed I sometimes just feel like I could burst into tears at work.. which in turn is affecting my physical health now too."
[NJ] Company with <50 FTE. 1099 contractor taking time off to have a baby. Temp 1099 contractor hired to cover leave. Moral/legal dilemma.,"The person hired as a temp drastically outperforms this contractor - in terms of quality of work product, professionally supporting other employees, and general energy/ dedication to do their best work. This has also demonstrably affected everyone else‚Äôs work day in positive ways.NJ is an at-will state. The contract for the original 1099 employee and the current temp is for an hourly rate for hours performed.Not continuing with the original contractor and retaining the temp would objectively be best for the company.Legally- can the temp be retained and the relationship with the original contractor be terminated without negative consequences to the company?Morally- I feel like shit.Can anyone give the down and dirty on this situation? I‚Äôm agonizing over this.ETA: Thank you for your input. I will check with counsel to determine if there is any risk to termination of the contract.Follow up question.

How can I switch my Target job to a Non-Target job?,"Hey Everyone,If you are reading this post, I really need your advice here, I'll be 26 years old this coming November and I have 3 years of experience in sales & recruitment, in these 3 years I have changed 2 companies already (Not to mention I have been a top performer in my team but I know this is not something I would want to do in long term, then covid happened & I could not afford to lose my job at that time), the sales targets and the pressure was doing too much damage to my health, I joined recruitment thinking this would be the new thing for me to learn, that too Night shift and its almost going be my 6 months here, same target pressure, sleep cycle getting disturbed, I really want to leave target job & start something where there are no targets. I am from a commerce background. Could you recommend what courses or jobs I can apply to upskill myself, so I can leave these dead-end jobs?"
[PH] Is there something more here or I'm overthinking?,"I offboarded from an internship position yesterday. I sent my resignation earlier this week, indicating that my offboarding would be two weeks from now. However, the company decided to move the offboarding to yesterday. Is there a bigger meaning behind this, or it's a completely normal and harmless practice for HR to do?"
[CAN] Is looking at venture capitalist investment a good way to focus my job search?,"I've been looking for work for a bit now. I graduated right into a recession and (the beginnings of) WW3, so jobs are scarce at the moment. I've put in several hundred applications, but I only have a few promising leads so far.I did some research into applying for work, and I found this thread:MilaMaples's comment from discussion ""AITA for slacking at work when my boyfriend has a really demanding job?""Which seems to have some really good advice. Some excerpts:CAREER GROWTHfollow the money, see where VC investment is going.Become a subject matter expert in a topic that is both highly funded by VC for the next 5 to 10 years and is currently lacking in expertiseNo need to post socially on LinkedIn, but read other people's posts. If someone seems to be an expert in your desired field, send them a message telling them you found their post interesting and ask them a follow up question if they're willing to chat!

[CA] Requested time off,"Can my work deny my request for one day off that is requested in advance (3 weeks at least) because I don‚Äôt have vacation time left? I explained that it‚Äôs for a doctors appointment for my child, but they are denying my request. Looking for advice or suggestions."
[HI] Do I have any recourse? Drug test protocols not being followed.,"My job is a union job with guidelines on how drug tests can be given.  The test I was given, I passed yet the policies were not followed and I was given the test in front of others.  This violates the policies. I worry about impact of being viewed in a particular way as I was the only one given a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù test in front of my co-workers."
[UK] Manager is starting an investigation and hinting at getting my license revoked,"I am a nurse and I left my stable and awake post-op patient with the anaesthetist and the surgeon because my shift finished and I had a commitment to attend (which I already communicated earlier in the day stating if we went ahead with the third case and we don‚Äôt finish on time, then I would not be able to stay). The case was not discussed (according to the policy, a briefing should be done before collecting a patient for surgery- this was not done and not everyone in the team knew that the patient was sent for). Note that this is a frequent occurrence at work which mostly leaves staff with no choice but to stay overtime regardless of their personal plans or commitments. You just find out for example at 18:00 that you won‚Äôt be able to finish your shift on time- sometimes people go home at 3, 4am. Two of the managers held an ‚Äúinformal‚Äù meeting with me (I asked if someone could take the minutes but they insisted it was just a talk) and asked that I submit a written statement. I have written to my union because managers will be (if they haven‚Äôt already) contacting HR to hold an investigation and they kept emphasising I could lose my license (I have thought of this and many other consequences but I got fed up doing surprise overtimes and getting a nonchalant ‚Äúthat‚Äôs part of the job‚Äù response).The managers are heavily focusing on the ‚Äúsafety of the patient‚Äù theme but clinically the patient was stable- I would not have left them otherwise. Additionally, I spoke with the anaesthetist who ok‚Äôd me to go. The patient was ok and discharged safely (after I had left). Is this enough to fire me or strike me off the register, and was I in the right for advocating for my contracted work hours?"
[MA] Potential Hire Asking for My Salary,I was promoted to Director in 2020 and have been assured I‚Äôm ‚Äúwithin range‚Äù for my pay scale. I‚Äôm hiring a new Manager for my team and during review with the recruiter he showed me the current scale for the Manager Range - I‚Äôm just above it by $3k (and this is after a September merit increase that I had to fight for). The prospect is asking for my same salary. He‚Äôd be a huge benefit to my group and for organization - I desperately need the help. but I‚Äôm not sure I can stomach making the same salary. Has anyone else been in this situation?  How‚Äôd you handle it?Quick Edit: am not suggesting that we don‚Äôt pay. This is more about me coming to terms with it as it‚Äôs new territory for me.
[SC] How do I know if I left money on the table?,"I got an offer and I‚Äôm happy. It is a 50% raise and a promotion and a half.But as I look back on the process, I can‚Äôt help but wonder how I know if I left money on the table or not?When I think about it, at the phone screen, I was the one who gave the salary range. So I set the min/max.But I had no real sense of how to price it. I‚Äôm in a fairly specialized field so I can‚Äôt just search ‚Äúcommunications manager‚Äù on these salary websites. I just knew what a couple friends make and there myself in that mix.The company came in at the 1/3 point of my range, I countered, and they came back in the middle of my range. And fast too, it took 40 minutes for them to respond to my counter with a new offer.So while I‚Äôm happy, I also can‚Äôt help but think about how this process worked. What if I had given numbers that were 20% higher? Or for all I know, did they have to stretch and reprice the salary band higher to get me? I guess I‚Äôll find out soon enough there are two other people on the team with the same title as me."
[CAN] Looming for some piece of mind‚Ä¶what could be causing this delay?,"Hello üëãüèªI interview for a job with a territorial government. Couple hours after the interview, I was contacted by HR to ask for references. According to their HR process, they only ask the top candidate for references and an offer is made upon the receipt of three positive references. I provided them with three great references, and briefed my references on what to expect and the role etc.Fast forward three weeks to the day and I haven‚Äôt heard a peep other then to confirm the receipt of my references. One of my references reached out to tell me she had her call scheduled for this past Tuesday.I‚Äôm just wondering what could be holding everything up when the process prior to this had been so quick (screening, assignment, interview). Could this mean I won‚Äôt get an offer? Should I follow up with HR? Any help interpreting this would be much appreciated, thank you!"
[CA] Boss recommending me for promotion but assumes I have engineering degree when I don‚Äôt. Am I screwed?,"I‚Äôve been at my company for a little under 2 years as a software engineer.  My degree is in math.  Boss randomly tells me that he‚Äôs recommending me for promotion and he says ‚Äúyou just need to show that you have engineering degree and the work you‚Äôve contributed to at this company‚Äù.

[CAN] using PTO during office closures,"Hi everyone! With the holidays coming up, the company I work for will be closed from Christmas to New Year's day. For context, I'm located in Ontario, so this means there are three days of office closure that are not covered by statutory holidays.Our company's practice is to have employees use their own PTO options for those 3 days, or have them be unpaid days off. This is obviously inequitable and disproportionately negatively impacts some employees more than others.Wondering if folks here can share examples of companies that offer these days as automatic paid days off to employees, so that they don't need to use their own PTO?"
"[NJ] Am I really working for a US company? (Remote, non-citizen)","Greetings,I am a non-US citizen (citizen/living in East Europe) and couple of months ago I've started remotely working for a US business (LLC, I believe). The thing is I am not sure if, in the eyes of the U.S, I am seen as working there.It's a small company and all the HR stuff was done through Zenefits (there is no HR person, the boss takes care of that). I have digitally signed the offer and even filled out some tax documents; Federal W4 and NJ State W4 (where the company is located). For the W4 forms I am told to put my social security number as 111111111 and put the company address for the address info.According to unh .edu website:Instructions on the Form W-4 are intended only for U.S. citizens, ""Green Card"" holders, and permanent residents for tax purposes. Therefore, with a few exceptions, the instructions printed on the worksheet of Form W-4 should not be followed by individuals who are not considered to be residents for U.S. income tax purposes.Also my salaries are wired to my bank account from one of my boss' relative living in my country (local bank to local bank).It all feels sketchy, I am not sure if this is normal or a charade to pay less tax? I don't have much knowledge on this topic. Is there anyway I can check this? What do I need to prove that I am working for this company?Thanks in advance, sorry if I didn't include a necessary information in the post, I can provide more info."
Ask for a raise or wait until annual reviews? [FL],"Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but would love some input. Sorry for formatting - on mobile.So I‚Äôve been working at my current company for technically almost 3 years, but my original firm was acquired by a much larger company (we‚Äôll call them XYZ). For context, prior to the merger, I was switching from the technical side to the business development side of the company and was working that role 4 months before the merger. Company XYZ merger was completed early 2022 and for the first 2 months, they basically had me in a lull period trying to find a role for me. They stated that they didn‚Äôt have the same role I was doing available and then I was basically waiting for them to suggest roles that would be a fit for both myself and the firm. Finally in August, I was place in my current role. I do really like my job, the company, the culture, the benefits, etc. so I really don‚Äôt want to leave my job.Here‚Äôs where my frustration comes in. I was previously a business analyst and making about $67k/year. This was fine with me, but of course I would love to make more money. Now my dilemma is that I am working along side senior associates that all make well of 6 figures and I have the same $67k salary. There are 3 other people with my exact role title that are senior associates (two levels above my current level). We do the same job with the same functionality. With my new role I‚Äôve been given a lot of executive tasks, working in management of project managers and on a council to run the portfolio I work on.As a responsibility of my new role, I‚Äôm involved with staffing calls and can see the budgeted salaries for open roles projects are hiring for. Business Analyst budgets right now are ranging between $85k - 120k. Since I‚Äôm no longer an analyst and in a higher project operation roles, I feel I should have received a salary increase with the promotion. I‚Äôm still making $67k and our annual evals are approaching in March 2023.Do I compose something to my boss requesting a meeting to discuss increasing my salary or wait until annual evals? I feel underpaid and unsure if it would come across entitled to ask for a $20k pay bump at this time? I would love any input or advice.For additional context: I did start browsing other jobs with similar roles and the salary should be $85k - $100k for my position. I did have a phone interview last week for a business analyst role offering me $95k‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to leave my job, but really want to be paid what I‚Äôm worth."
[PA] October healthcare premium ($480) was wrongly auto drafted from my personal checking on 9/30 and I haven‚Äôt gotten it back yet.,"I was self-employed for almost two years and had purchased an individual healthcare plan directly from the insurance company. Signed up for auto pay. Easy peasy.At my new job, they don‚Äôt offer group health insurance. Instead, they offer dollar amount per month to cover whatever individual plan you want to purchase. They use a third party company to handle this. So my job pays the third party, then the third party handles all enrollment and pays each employee‚Äôs individual plan each month.When I got this job, I upgraded to a better plan with my existing health insurance company. I called them to let them know that I was cancelling the old plan and that my company would be paying the premium for my new plan. They seemed to understand.Towards the end of August, the September premium was paid by the third party company. Great.Then, on 9/30, my October premium was auto drafted from my small business checking account. Same as when I was self employed.I was fighting with the insurance company for two weeks after that because I never signed up for auto pay on the new plan. Only the old plan that was cancelled. They said too bad, the auto pay rolled over to the new plan because it was tied to my account and not the plan itself? Fine, whatever.In the meantime, in the middle of October, the third party made another premium payment that the insurance company allocated to November.The third party told me to ask the insurance company to refund the 9/30 payment and allocate the most recent payment to October, because that‚Äôs the month it was intended for. Insurance company refused. The third party said they‚Äôd look into it almost a week ago. My boss said she‚Äôd talk to the higher ups at our company again over a week ago and I haven‚Äôt heard back.Our one HR person (small company) has been aware of this situation for a month now and I haven‚Äôt heard from her.Someone owes me $480, right? Who, though? My company, the third party we pay to handle health insurance, or the insurance company?"
[CO] What would be undue hardship?,"I have been with my company for over three years.  I am immunodeficient.  This is a disability covered under the ADA.  I have been working from home part time on an accommodation since August of last year.  Prior to that, I was working from home full time after the pandemic started.If I get Covid, it would have a bigger impact on my health than most people.  I had it in May and had to miss over 40 hours of work as well as work from home for three weeks.  I had lingering health issues for 5 months after that.  I do everything I can to limit being around people in order to stay healthy.My employer is pressuring me to come back in person five days a week.  I haven‚Äôt had any performance issues.  They are saying if I don‚Äôt come back in person I might lose my job.  My immunologist and I feel like three days is already a huge risk to my health.What would be some examples of undue hardship that my employer could claim?  I don‚Äôt know if I should stick to my guns and say three days is the maximum I can work in person.  I feel like I am being forced to chose between my health and my job.  Thanks."
[NY] Issue with new coworker.. Should I ask HR?,"I've been working for a company close to 6 years as a developer. 5 months ago there was a new hire that I'll call Amy. She's a Project Manager. From the beginning the team and I have been confused on what her role exactly is. When I would send her some emails, she would reply to me with an attitude. I let it go in the beginning but later when working together she started being more and more rude. Whenever I ask her questions she usually goes to our manager to tattle (same manager) and my manager does one of the following: sends out an email to everyone, call me directly with Amy's question, or tell me in the meeting with the team about my concern.The issues have gotten worse lately. It has made a very toxic environment for me. I'm sure my boss knows of the issues. I got a very nasty email from Amy today, my boss was added in the email and said nothing of it. I see that my boss is on her side. Boss has been working around 6 years too.I reached out to HR to ask if she is available to meet. I would like to show her the email evidence of how Amy has been replying to me. I have been asking HR about what happens when someone leaves, do they get their vacation time paid in full, etc. I have been so stressed to the point that I want to resign. I don't want HR to talk to my manager or Amy about this, but I guess I wanted to let her know of this issue and to let me know if I might be wrong here. I have shown other people the emails I have received and they too see the attitude. Should I even meet with HR at all or ask if the things I show are confidential?"
[IL] employee false accusations,"To make a long story, short, My Employee [IL] is accusing me of racism and sniffing glue. Racism was unfounded and I now have to make a statement to HR about the glue bullshit. Employee says I pick on her, which is not true. I am her supervisor and simply want my staff to do their jobs. I don‚Äôt single anyone out. I am not going to make a statement until I speak to a lawyer due to the defamatory accusations. I am going to email HR and let them know this. Will I be put on leave? Could I get fired? Do I have any rights or say in whether I want this employee working under me? Im not planning on suing, but am planning on speaking to my lawyer about the statement. Just need some advice please!"

I've lived in my hometown pretty much my whole life and feel I need a new scenery.Would applying to a new office location as an internal employee look bad to HR and hiring managers? I have a good standing with my current office but just don't agree with the politics here.Also, my company has a rule that when we apply to other offices, we have to let our current hiring manager know. Is there any way to avoid doing this until I know for sure I got the position? I don't want my superiors to know that I'm applying elsewhere in case things don't work out."

[INDIA] Should I take a follow-up again?,"got a call from HR from a good company. He explained the job role and shared the first assessment with me. I completed that and he again shared an aptitude test. I submitted it the same day within the deadline and informed him over email. Then 5 days later, I received an email from him that I have cleared both assessments and he is waiting for the time slot to schedule my interview. Then, 3 days later he called to inform me that the interview is scheduled for the day after tomorrow and that he'll let me know the time on the same day.But, I didn't receive any mail or invitation till the evening so I sent a follow-up email to him. He responded that he'll call the next morning to let me know the further process. But, I didn't receive any call or update again.Should I take a follow-up again or is there something else I should do? Or, should I just wait for him to connect with me?"

[KS] COMP OFF Vs Overtime Vs Nothing,"Hi all, I work as a software engineer for a large investment bank in the united states. However, I am not hired directly by the bank but rather by a contractor (hourly exempt) that basically takes a cut from my pay. They provide no PTO at all so any day or rather hours that I don't work, I don't get paid.Usually on some Fridays we have work that extend anywhere from 3 to 4 hours past my shift, when I extended and logged those hours as extra hours in my timesheet my boss was not happy and said that we usually like to keep total hours at 40 hours a week.Now this is about to happen again next week so I consulted with him what he wants me to do in case I had to extend to finish work ... He said the most odd thing.He said log in normally at 9 ... Work for 4 hours ... Take 3 to 4 hour break mid day and then log in to continue to work (assuming that work will extend another 4 hours) so I end up with 8 work hours that day, even though I started at 9 and will likely finish at 9.Two problems here.This is very crappy and inconvenient, and possibly illegal.What if work finishes on time and I don't even have to extend at the end of the day ... I would log out at 6 PM and end up only working 5 or 6 hours ?!!They don't wanna approve overtime for my contractor to pay me for it ... And when I said I can accumulate these hours from many weeks and use them for time off since I don't have PTO he also said that's not allowed ... Ideally I should try to keep my hours at 40 hours a week ...But somehow he manages to expect me to do the late work .. so it's ok to take unpaid break during the day cuz there are other people there .. hut at the end of the day where only one or two people will work I have to be there."
[CA] Not able to access my Dental Benefits,"I have Delta dental and they have been letting dentists in my area submit claims for people that aren't me for about 8 or 9 years now.

I was given notice 3 weeks ago that I was being laid off due to restructuring of the group and was repeatedly told it was not due to performance( my performance review just a few months ago was great and I didn‚Äôt receive any negative feedback).I was given 45 days notice. There were others who were also laid off, either due to performance or bc of the restructuring across the US. What really bothered me about this was we were extremely busy all year, I was covering another role for 6 months along with working my own role and they finally filled the position about 3 months ago and there have been a few new additions to the team-replacements for those who‚Äôve left, a few weeks before my notice was given (these new additions were internal moves. These employees are a level lower than me but doing the same job)After doing some research on the WARN act for NYC, I‚Äôve come to find out that I should have been given 90 day notice just for being laid-off /+being located in NYC. Could anyone confirm if this is true or are there details I‚Äôm not considering that would be in favor of my employer giving me 45 days instead of 90?I want to approach my HR department with the request for additional time but want to be sure I have the proper info before asking.Happy to provide any additional details to assist with advice.

[CAN-AB] Management telling me not to complete daily tasks.,I was just wondering if this is legal and enforceable. I was told not to worry about half my usual morning shift duties and that the mid shift team member would take care of it.

[CAN] Is this ok as a reason to ask to push start date after written job offer signed?,"I got an offer these days for a job starting Jan next year. When asked about my start date, I mentioned there is an important milestone in my current company beginning of December, so there is no point in starting mid-December, then we aggreged for beginning of next year.However, I now want to ask to push that date, by 2 or 3 weeks, because, first, giving notice to my current company beginning of December will put my end of year company vacation at risk (which I totally deserve giving my non stop work this year). Second, I was planning to travel to my country for my wedding once I get a sign that the immigration application for my wife is on track, and I just got a good signal about that.

However, the salary they offered me was below market average for the position I would be filling.I told them I would need the weekend to think it over and that I have some concerns regarding the salary. HR seemed very willing to give me some time to think on it and begin negotiating on Monday of this week.Negotiating was fairly pleasant with no heavy pushback on my requests. They were slightly concerned with the salary I was asking for, but again they didn't really push back on it much.It is now Wednesday and I have not heard back from them yet. How long do negotiations usually take place? It's been a while since I've been in this position.ThanksEdit: they reached out to me today to let me know they are still waiting on certain approvals and I should expect an answer by early next week at the latest."

[CA] Should I go to HR a file a complaint about my Manger?,"I am having many problems with my manager, and I am unsure if it is in my head or if she is trying to get me to quit my job. Here are some recent examples of thingsI was supposed to attend a meeting where I was the lead in finalizing some documents. Right before the meeting, she told me due to competing priorities, she would go to the meeting and take it over, and I could not go to the meeting and focus on other tasks. She didn't ask me for any background and just took over. This is highly disruptive, and I have no idea what she is doing.She demanded that I move my approved vacation (Friday) so we could go over a presentation. I asked her if we could do it Thursday because I already have a plan. She said her schedule was booked for Thursday, so I must do it on Friday. She took a last-minute vacation Monday and Tuesday, and I have to work extra time to accommodate her. But now I have to cancel my plan for her?We have an unlimited PTO policy, so if I don't use I will lose it. I worked so hard this year and didn't take any vacation. So I asked her if I could take some Friday off. She agreed but later demanded that I must be aviable (via slack, phone, and email) when I am needed before she can approve my vacation.She is micromanaging me and demands everything go through her so she can pick and choose which item she can get credit on. She often took credit for the work I did without mentioning my contribution.When I asked if I could create a RACI (responsibility matrix) so we can know our responsibility and better support each other. She said no because I kept asking for it, ""I was not fit for the company's flexible start-up  environment.""Exclude me from several important meetings with the leadership group. Even I need to attend the meeting for my project. Her reason is that she will relay the information messages to me, but sometimes I am the last to know, and it disrupts my work.I did try to bring some of these issues up at our 1:1 and ask if she could better support me. She always turns it around as my problems. I am trying to manage her, or I am not a good fit. At this point, I don't want to bring it up anymore. I am afraid she is planning to get rid of me soon. She just hired another person starting next week.TLDR: I am afraid my manager is trying to get rid of or push me out. Should I go to HR to complain and document her creating toxic work environment?"
[CA] Can HR help with a co-worker slandering my reputation?,I am an educator and have seriously considered taking my concerns to HR because a co-worker consistently slanders my character. My immediate supervisor sent her an email to stop after an independent third party approached him with reports of ongoing slander and libel. This same co-worker accused me of sexual harassment last year. HR found no basis in the claim. She is a tenured  teacher so I think I just need to move on to a different school. My professional reputation is important to my livelihood.
need advice please! [PA],"For some background: i interviewed for the job I currently have (HR Generalist) and I was told the salary range then when I was offered the job I was told they told me the wrong thing and it was actually 3k less (I decided to not negotiate or fuss because of the benefits and it being hybrid because I really wanted that perk) and they also told me I‚Äôd receive training and Ive received barely any training since I started over two months ago.Also during the interview my now boss told me that they just implemented a remote policy and as long as two people on our team are in the office each day he doesn‚Äôt care. So fast forward to a little over two months into the role I asked to start working 2 days from home (the only other person on our 4 person team that does is my boss, the other two people decided not to) and yesterday he told me that new hires actually need to be here for a year before they can but he‚Äôll let me know by thanksgiving what‚Äôs going on. Not ideal but okay. Today as he‚Äôs walking past my office and he says btw you can starting working from home 1 day a week at your six months, but if you‚Äôre working on xyz project you can work from home now. Which honestly makes no sense because what difference does it make? I have zero meetings in person and no one stops by my office for anything because a majority of my work is done on the computer. He told me from day 1 if I‚Äôm not happy to tell him so I don‚Äôt know if I should just email him twice a week that I‚Äôm working on xyz project and wfh like I want to or sit down and tell him I‚Äôm not happy because when I interviewed this is what was said and was a major factor in my decision to accept the job. I‚Äôm just really disappointed and frustrated because everything they said in the interview seems to of been a lie.Please ignore my terrible writing and grammar etc., it‚Äôs been a long day."
[AU] Colleague has been calling me 'pretty boy/princess' among other things for 4 months. How best to deal with this?,"[AU] For the last 4-5 months a team member (fork lift driver) at work has exclusively referred to me (27m,)  as 'pretty boy', 'princess', and another borderline homophobic remark.Initially, I accepted it as a joke/banter. However, of late it has become increasingly malicious in tone, and the chronic nature of his remarks is beginning to annoy me. I can feel it begin to hit a bottleneck.Yesterday, I was in our warehouse dock, whilst there was a forklift around. I communicated with the driver to confirm it was safe for me to pass with my pallet jack/pallet. Driver (different colleague) said it was all good for me to move my pallet. This other guy interjects saying 'wait your turn, you f'ing pretty boy'.I've documented a couple of interactions like this in my phone, and will continue to do so. Considering reporting to management, or just dealing with the guy myself.To make sure I'm not misinterpreting his words and reacting disproportionately to the situation, is the general consensus that these words would be perceived as an insult? Especially in the context of coming from a middle aged male co-worker. Cheers"
[TX] Wrong salary,"Need help drafting a email to address a concern with my salary.Recently learned HR did not include previous verified work experience in my salary calculations. As a result, i got stuck on the low end of the salary range. FYI: it‚Äôs government, the range was provided in the job description.How do professional say I want all verified work experience included in my work history and salary recalculated? I have documentation to support the oversight. It‚Äôs been over a year but this has always bothered me. I accepted the position because I needed it (pandemic). I actually enjoy work/role but feel resentment because I know I should be getting paid more. We are talking 5 years not included in work history would have put me past minimum requirements. Provided HR with VOE letters for every job they couldn‚Äôt verify through their system. I know now they didn‚Äôt even attempt to re-verify but one job and even then still didn‚Äôt include it. Wrong.Before you ask, already went to management. They can‚Äôt help because it‚Äôs an HR function (thanks government). They aren‚Äôt involved in the process."
Sephora mistreatment towards employees? [CA],"Location - canada ontarioI recently started working at Sephora, I‚Äôm very new to working at retail. I‚Äôm a college student and when I applied for this position, it said the minimum requirement is to work 15 hours a week. With that in mind, I decided i‚Äôll work weekends.But my sephora employers are not having it. They said i NEED to work 3 days a week, even though they never said this in the job description or requirements. They told me i cannot work more than 7 hours a day because I work PT and yet.. on my first day i literally worked 9 hours and they are continuously scheduling me for 8 hours back to back. I previously told them that i have school and cant work til late and they pretty much told me to suck it up.Not only that, but theyre cheap and wont hire proper cleaners. They recently hired cleaners to work biweekly.. which means we need to clean the toilets during closing hours (10pm) on school nights.I have proof via email that my employer said pt employees cannot work 7+ hours.They put me on cash for the first time today, and everyone knows that new cashiers need to be shadowed, right? Well they left me all alone for hours.. i messed up tons of transactions because im new AND there was a huge sale going on so there was a huge rushWhat should i do? They are severely understaffed because word has it that tons of people just resigned due to mistreatment by staff."

[MA] How to hint to you boss that you will quit unless promoted?,"How do you say / imply diplomatically to your boss that unless a promotion happens you will resign your position?After putting 80 hour work weeks and being told that it will take 1-2 years to get promoted when you see 3 people are your level get promoted after only 8-9 months, something has to give. I am extremely unhappy, overworked, and 2 years for a promotion compared to other (i.e., peers) is ridiculous.How do I drop the hint that something has to change or I am leaving?"
[CAN] Am I in Trouble for Background Check?,"I am a college student going through a background check for my new employer, and the background check company is unable to verify one piece of information regarding my employment history.Specifically, I was a contractor at a consulting company and I was under the impression that I was a contractor employee of the consultancy; however, I was informed yesterday that I was not a direct employee of the company because I was a contractor from a third-party vendor and the consultancy is unable to verify my employment record, which makes sense.I did not indicate that I was a full-time permanent employee at the firm on my background check form nor did it ask if I was, and I was on the consultancy's project full time and reported to a project manager at the consulting firm so I am not lying about my involvement at the firm.My resume also indicates that I worked at the consultancy, not the vendor, although I did not say I was an intern nor a permanent full time employee. I just did not specify the employment type.In this case, would this discrepancy jeopardize my employment prosperity if I mistakenly put the consultancy as an employer instead of the contracting company?"

"[TX] If work day starts Sun and I started my week on Sat, does the paystub work period start on Sun still or before?","Example:Let's say Sun is the 2nd of the month and since Sun is the start of the work week, the work week would be Sun-Sat (2nd-8th for this example month). So the paystub would typically say work period from 2nd-8th (of whatever month it is,  for this example). But what period would the paystub work period say if I started work week on Sat - for example if I worked 1st-5th of the month?"
"[NY] Does ""eligible for rehire"" really mean ""eligible for rehire""?","Hello everyone, I was recently let go from my position due to ""not being a good fit with the manager"", I was not given any other info than that and the director said I was eligible for rehire. I have been applying to other positions within the organization, however whenever I look online, my application does not make it past their ATS software, it just says ""pending"" or ""awaiting submission to HR"". It is a major hospital system in NYC, I was not in any union due to being in a management role. Besides being stonewalled by HR (never answer calls/return messages) and Labor Relations telling me ""uhhh, yeah just apply"" I am really doubting the validity of what the director said.Edit: I am not applying for the same position, I have been applying for similar roles at different locations as well as roles I am very overqualified for to see whats going on. I also found out afterwards that the old supervisor came back due to the location he was at closing."

I have taken THC gummies recently, it is legal in my state but I am assuming this does not matter since it is based on the Federal law. I will most definitely fail it.

[OR] Possible termination immanent,"Is this legal and what can I do to hold the appropriate people accountable?I  have acquired complaints  and corrective action when working away from  my home base. Issues resulting in complaints are more systemic: 1. Info needed to do our jobs can be hard to attain.  Staff do not understand ""teamwork"" and ""communication"" so, 2. some staff will  not address an issue directly, seeking to understand co-workers' rationale. Instead they complain about the co-worker.Rules for the job have changed suddenly and dramatically.  We have been disciplined for not being able to track rapid, sweeping changes in practice. Therefore, I have unfactual info in  my  file. I was interviewed by management, and I also replied in writing, in an effort  to clarify. This has had no affect on my file. Some of the complaints  mischaracterize the events reported and mischaracterize me. I have addressed this in writing. There is an plain double standard in who and what are reported: entitled people who may be harder to approach are not reported. On the other hand, I have been yelled at based on illogical preferences both by a (past) manager and (repeatedly) by staff.I  have been informed that my next error will end my employment of 20  years. This could be the perceived error of someone who does not know me or care to inquire with me. I am a sitting duck. This is effecting my health. Dozens of staff have been leaving in droves for a couple years, citing upper management not listening to us. My boss and administrator are lovely. I get the sense that their hands are tied by higher ups.I would leave, but my  health now requires that I change my  career and my degree will not give me a position that will support me in  another field until I gain experience in that field. Working on this  now."
[CAN-AB] ROE deadline,"This isn't as much a HR issue, but perhaps someone can clarify this for me. I've looked over the Service Canada website a few times and I'm still not sure about the deadline for me to get my electronic ROE. For me, my pay period ending doesn't line up with the day I am paid for that period. My last pay period ended the 21st for example and then I got paid the 31st of October. Still no ROE - but did I get it wrong? Is it 5 days after the 21st or 5 days after the 31st? I'm concerned about this employer not doing things right (a consistent theme for me, they've already messed up my overtime pay)."
Severance pay in the US (specifically [CA]).,"I know that severance is not required in a reduction in force (though I thought that in certain circumstances, it was...). However now that I've been laid off, I have received communication about the severance, both the amount and how that number was calculated.Can it rescinded for reasons outside of what was already specified in the agreement, or could a new amount be provided if ""there was an error""?The agreement stated that the severance would be paid in ""the next payroll cycle"" which has passed, but I have not received my severance. When I asked HR, I got a kindly-worded ""we don't know.""Could someone point me to some resources so I can understand this better?"
[FL] Previous boss making things difficult at new job,"Not sure what to do here.I left a very toxic work environment 3 months ago. I was burnt out, underpaid, and just not supported in any way. A lot of my negative feelings were towards my previous manager - he was just insufferable in so many ways.I was working for a third party that supports a very large tech company. Right now I work with another third party that supports the same tech company but in the business space rather than the consumer space.What this means is that SOMETIMES we end up having to collaborate with my old team. My new team is amazing. They‚Äôre supportive, celebrate me, and they‚Äôre so proud to have me on the team. My old boss (not necessarily team) has been the worst. Where I am warm and welcoming when trying to work with him, he is cold and dismissive. He tries to prevent me from making connections, has accused me of poaching (people are just quitting because they don‚Äôt want to be there), has attempted to send me a text saying that I can‚Äôt do certain things and I need permission from his parent company leaders (I have my parent company‚Äôs leadership permission).I‚Äôm so filled with anxiety that his actions are going to cause my new team to look at me like I‚Äôm bringing negativity to the team or I‚Äôm bringing drama. They seem to have my back and have mentioned how much of an asset I am but it‚Äôs still hard not to think about. I feel like my other coworkers can‚Äôt move forward and collab with my old team because of my relationship with my old boss even though I‚Äôve tried to be nice and respectful.I guess what I‚Äôm looking for here is, what are my options? I don‚Äôt work for their company anymore so am I able to go to HR with my company? Or do I go to HR for the parent company?

Also I am just a fresher so I am thinking they are just making things up since they tell everything on call without any mail or policy proofs.

[MI] Calling Black male co-workers Brother,"First-time poster and first-time manager looking for some advice here. To put it very simply, one of the people I supervise, a white female, has made it a habit to call her Black male co-workers ‚ÄúBrother.‚Äù Obviously this isn‚Äôt okay, and I‚Äôve talked to the two main co-workers (who I also supervise) about it, checking in on how they felt about it and if they needed to be connected with any resources. They‚Äôve both acknowledged it‚Äôs not okay, but thankfully they haven‚Äôt been personally offended and understand she has no malicious intent. We‚Äôre a very close group - all around similar ages and we generally all get along quite well, doing things together outside of work and being quite comfortable talking to each other about non-work subjects. Since we have those strong relationships, I offered to either talk to the woman myself or give them the opportunity to talk to her about it as an educational conversation (I made it clear it should not be their responsibility to teach in this situation if they didn‚Äôt want to). One of the men wanted to talk to her and did approach the subject with her, but quickly stopped the conversation when she brought up free speech. So now it‚Äôs my turn. Now my question is, how to I approach this? I‚Äôm also a white female and while I know it‚Äôs wrong what she‚Äôs doing, I can‚Äôt find the words to explain why.

[FI] Work description & increased salary long due,"Long story short. Over a year ago I started doing manning planning at my current job, I was confused when I learned that the other two persons in my team have a higher responsibility rate. We have slightly different roles but we work as a team.Half a year after that the old worker who used to do my job comes back, after and before returning I learned that her responsibility rate had been higher than mine (same amount of responsibility & experience in the field).I was promised retroactive pay for the difference almost a year back now and I haven't seen anything and I've been nagging my boss about it. Now recently I got a new role and I was promised by the high boss of my department (above my boss) that I'd have a work description & increase in salary within the month of September.... Well nothing yet...The amount of work & responsibility has steadily been increasing yet no signs of higher salary. My morale is worse & I'm feeling old symptoms of stress & burnout coming back that I had gotten rid of roughly 2 years ago. I also feel very unmotivated.What do you think I should do? I've had loads of empty promises. I've loads done overtime, always offered my help & accepted new challenges. Done lots of development which has helped the company a whole lot. Yet very rarely do I receive even a ""Thank you"", and they cannot keep their promises..."
[IL] need old payslip from current employer for background check but payslip no longer exists,I recently received an offer at a new company and am going through the background check process.

Weird hiring process [NY],"I applied for a job and I‚Äôve already interviewed with the hiring manager along with two other people. What‚Äôs weird is that the hiring manager has been handling everything including setting up the interviews. I haven‚Äôt heard anything from an HR person. Also, the two other people I‚Äôve interviewed with didn‚Äôt seem really prepared to interview me. I haven‚Äôt been asked any behavioral questions at all. The interviews have been about what they do with a little time at the end for my questions.

Am I overthinking this?"
[CAN-ON] Termination without cause,"Until recently, I worked for a large engineering consulting firm in Ontario, Canada, and my contract was terminated without cause. I asked if the termination was related to my performance and I was told that it was not. Prior to this discussion, I was not given any indication that my employment was about to end. My PMs were happy with my work over the multiple years I worked for this employer. Then an hour later, HR was at my door taking back my laptop/ phone. I am very confused and have never heard of this happening to other co-workers. Why didn't they try to work things out with me, what could have been so terrible that they felt the need to fire me? Will I ever find out why I was fired? What should my next steps be? I'm also a brown female and visibly religious, not sure if that matters.I do not have a good relationship with my ex-manager, he/she delivered the final 'notice of termination' with HR and did not answer any of my questions about why. I spoke to an employment lawyer who concluded that there's nothing I can do at this time as they acted per the original employment contract by giving me the correct weeks of pay in lieu of notice, however, if it takes me longer than two months to find a job, I might be able to take legal action then."

[NY] How likely is an employer to exceed your salary expectations?,"In my initial screening the recruiter asked what my salary expectations were. I did my research beforehand and gave a range that felt substantial. For example, I said $50,000 - $60,000 was what i was looking for and then asked if the given range aligned with their budget for the role.The recruiter confidently replied yes and we moved on. Now, we‚Äôre wrapping up the hiring process and getting closer to a final decision. New York has just instilled a new salary transparency law (thank God) in which companies have to list the salary in the job description.I‚Äôve just checked and it says the salary for the role i‚Äôm currently interviewing for ‚Äústarts at $55,000 (with increased salary steps as you learn and master the role).‚Äù On one hand, I‚Äôm happy that my request was very close to the budget for the role, but after learning more about the role and it‚Äôs requirements i‚Äôm worried that I lowballed myself and that I‚Äôm leaving money on the table.If their range starts at $55,000, I‚Äôd assume the other end of the range could be as high as $65k-$70k. How likely is it they‚Äôll exceed my initial salary expectations?"

[CA] Wanting to Improve EE Enrollment Experience,I work in HR for a mid size non-profit and we have a great variety in employees. We have many employees who are not computer literate and don't have English as their first language. We are working to make their enrollment in benefits experience as seamless and not intimidating as possible. We are creating a survey to send out to employees to gather how their experience with enrollments have been and how it can be improved. Does anyone have any suggestions for questions we should ask on the survey?
[NY] NYC Salaried Exempt - No pay for extra hours worked,"My husband is in a non-exempt role, 7hr day, 35hr work week. During a week with a company paid holiday, he worked an extra 2 hours. However, on his paycheck he was only paid for his standard work hours. The extra 2 hours were missing.Previously when he worked extra hours, he was always paid for that extra time worked regardless if there was time off in the same week. In this instance, he's not expecting 1.5x overtime pay. He's just expecting payment for those extra hours worked at his regular rate.When he inquired with HR on the missing two hours they told him that because there was 7 hours of holiday pay that week he was not entitled to the 2 hours of extra pay, because he is salaried non-exempt. He would have to work more than 7 extra hours that week to be entitled to extra pay.When he asked when his status changed to salary non-exempt they said he was always in this status but he was being paid incorrectly previously. In my mind, this qualifies as a change in status because he had always been paid as a standard non-exempt employee before. He should have been notified.It was also always my understanding that a non-exempt person should be paid for every hour that they work. However, I can't seem to find any definitive rules around ""salaried non-exempt"" when looking up FLSA laws.Is his HR dept breaking the law?"

Undergarment Issue in the Workplace [CAN-ON],"Looking for assistance on how to deal with the following issue:I am an HR Manager (female) and work in a small manufacturing company where our staff is 98% men. With this, I have 2 female employees, and have recently gotten many complaints that one of them is choosing to no longer wear a bra a work. I understand this is a personal choice by the individual and really has nothing to do with our dress code policy. However, this individual has been known to report other employees for ""leering"" and other similar concerns in the past, and only 1 out of 7 reports came to be true, though still managed to damage other workers reputations as gossip spreads quickly. This employee is also well endowed and is making a lot of other employees uncomfortable as the nature of their work sometimes causes them to be in small, confined areas. Her team members are worried that they are going to be 'next' in her recent slew of reports, and don't know how to comfortably work with her. Today the other female coworker also complained stating that the individual ""seems to be unnaturally swinging her chest around and making it well known that she is no longer wearing a bra""I would appreciate any advice on the situation.Thank youHR Manager"
[UK] Garden Leave,"I have been put under Garden Leave (I requested this after they claimed I had mental health issues and needed to take leave, I decided to resign and request Garden Leave as a result) here in the UK.

My Line Manager (who absolutely hates me, and is the reason why 5 people left the company within 7 months) has complained that I have a pending work matter relating to completing her business card.

[NY] Unemployment filing question,"Hi friends!I was recently laid off and have never filed for unemployment before (NYC based). My former employer has offered severance and has sent over the agreement for me to review/sign. I have some questions...Should I file for unemployment now as I review the severance agreement? I do plan on signing it.I have 21 days to review/sign and 7 days to rescind the signature ( the payment would be issued on the first Friday that is 8 days after signature)...should I wait until the 21st day to sign banking that the payment would hit on the 31st day after employment ends to maximize my unemployment?I'm unsure of how the timing around any of this works, and am of course really anxious but appreciative of any tips anyone can offer. Thank you all in advance!"
[TN] Seeking advice on hostile work environment,"I‚Äôve worked at my restaurant for 8 years through three parent companies. Over the summer, a server was hired who decided early on that she did not like me. This was not a big deal to me at the time, so I mostly ignored it and tried to be nice to her when we interacted. However, she was objectively not a great hire. She would show up high as a kite and then leave during her shift to get high, and her work ethic was about what you‚Äôd imagine. This was at a time when we were short-staffed, so her absence and lack of contribution were incredibly palpable.Eventually, she took issue with my seniority and created drama with me, essentially saying that my getting ‚Äúgood‚Äù shifts takes money out of other people‚Äôs pockets. She badmouthed me to other servers and got them to band together to keep me from getting closing shifts on the weeknights, an arrangement I‚Äôve had there for years not just because of seniority but because I keep my children while my husband is at his 8-5, so I literally can‚Äôt come on any earlier. I also do a damn good job and have relationships with our regulars going back years, whereas she has picked fights with customers.Are you wondering what the hell kind of management team we have? It‚Äôs one of the worst I‚Äôve ever worked for, and I‚Äôm working my way out, particularly after the most recent incident.A few weeks ago, I found out during my shift from another server that I was no longer closing that night. I asked the manager on duty, Bart, if that was truly the case. He said, ‚ÄúWell, the server you‚Äôre having ongoing drama with says she hasn‚Äôt been making a lot of money lately, and I figured since you picked up a shift this week, I‚Äôd let her take your close.‚Äù I was obviously pissed but didn‚Äôt kick up a ton of drama about it that night. However, I found out later that week from another server that this shit-starting server delighted in getting my closing shift taken from me. So I went to Bart to discuss that she is creating a hostile work environment for me, and his response? To disclose that she‚Äôs actually being sexually harassed by our GM. Which is obviously not okay but it‚Äôs not a credit to her personality, it has absolutely nothing to do with me, and it was completely inappropriate to share that with me in that way at that time. I am actually extremely trustworthy with sensitive information, but I side-eye anyone who shares something like that so casually.I had to follow up with him every shift following that because it felt like he has decided my situation with her wasn‚Äôt a big deal. In fact, a couple times he had said that he needed to deal with the sexual harassment first. Eventually he did talk about it with her, and this man actually told her in the same conversation that I had highlighted her marijuana use when talking to him about her being hostile towards me! So she, unsurprisingly, became worse towards me and managed to turn more servers against me.She has since contacted HR and filed a complaint about them showing favoritism. And I‚Äôve since experienced sexual harassment by the GM. Apparently he does it to every female staff member.Do I have any options from here? I don‚Äôt want to work for such a shit-show of a management team, but if it‚Äôs possible for me to say anything, I‚Äôd like any advice on how to best approach the conversation. I have the opportunity to meet with the district manager soon, and I was thinking of sitting down with him with an organized version of this post to keep unnecessary details to a minimum.I mentioned earlier that we‚Äôre on parent company number 3, and I want to highlight that again because it means that my standing with the company only goes back a year. Most of the previous staff has moved on, so I don‚Äôt have a ton of good people to vouch for me."

[IL] Paid Time Off Request Notice,"On Monday last week, I informed my manager that I would take a day off for the following week (I did not tell them the reason why, which is this brief following explanation) since I can see ahead that I‚Äôm pushing myself too hard if I work 5 days a week after a 3-day work trip (from Wed to Fri) connecting to a 2-day weekend traveling (Sat & flying back Sunday). I told them it would probably be Friday or another day later in the week since I want to wrap up a few things in the beginning of the week after a long work trip before taking a day off, but I was not sure which day later in the week yet and will let them know (I did not specify when I would let them know either). They talked about how I should take Monday off since they always takes the day after a work trip off and that I should take Monday off instead of Friday and thanked me for letting her know ahead of time since she would normally just take off whichever day she wanted without notice. I felt a bit uneasy since now my choice is narrowed down to just either Monday or Friday? Fast forward to when the work week is over, (fyi the manager was on the same work trip with me, but they flew back on Friday while I stayed in the area for the weekend.) On Monday morning, they messaged me asking if I was taking the day off. I said no and mentioned I would take Wednesday off instead since it works better for my schedule. They mentioned that they knew that it was a different circumstance, but they needed more than a week‚Äôs notice on what specific day. They wasn‚Äôt sure if I was working today or not. I then responded in the heat of the moment ‚ÄúSince this is only a day off, I think giving you a 2-3 business day notice is sufficient. They then said that they were communicating with me what they needed from me and to please comply with this. They would be happy to make exceptions if necessary, but it was helpful for them to have time to plan a week ahead. They also added that some companies would ask for months in advance and left it as that.I work in an ad agency in social media where I have my own group of small clients. I‚Äôm not in any meetings with client, and we‚Äôre at a time where we don‚Äôt have any pressing items to be done. The policy and expectations for giving pto requests were not stated when I onboarded, so I stuck to my rule of thumb to give them as much notice as I could or twice/tripple the amount of time I‚Äôm taking off. In my case, I believe I gave them enough notice in advance.My question is: was I behaving unprofessionally? How should I have approached this situation or the Monday conversation and what should I do moving forward? I plan to ask them to give me a specific guide of how much notice they expect me to give for PTO down to the amount of days (ex: 1 day = 1 week‚Äôs notice, 2-3 days = ..., etc.). Should I voice my side of the story about her assuming I would take Monday off?Tldr: how much notice do you give your manager for 1 day off when it‚Äôs not an emergency?"
[TX] Performance Review,"I recently got my performance review and my manager rated me a 2/5. This is completely shocking to me considering my last evaluation was ‚Äúmeets standards‚Äù just a few months ago. The manager used extremely vague summaries that provided no information or examples about my performance. In one section she wrote that I haven‚Äôt helped my team and it‚Äôs been mentioned to her. This is the first time I‚Äôve heard this and don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs true at all. I take a lot of pride in building strong internal relationships and work hard to make sure my stakeholders are happy. She then goes on to say that I‚Äôm not managing our content strategy but she owns that and assigns the projects to the team. There are 3 other people responsible for content. The examples she cited mention work owned by another person on the team. The feedback has left me feeling like I don‚Äôt belong here because it doesn‚Äôt matter how hard I work, what I do, I‚Äôll always get the blame for whatever goes wrong‚Ä¶I guess I‚Äôd like to know if it‚Äôs worth having an addendum added to the feedback through HR. I have emails and slack messages that support me and I honestly feel like this review was not accurate at all."
[NC]A help for my very tech illiterate relative...,"Hi all,this is a bit confusing situation for me and my relative, so please bear with me. She is in the NC, USA.My relative and I are really close, and she is very tech illiterate. I often have to explain A to Z on how to click stuff and whatnot and try to have her learn as much as possible. I make sure to not submit anything on behalf of her.Today, she called me in panic that and told me that her previous submission for 2023 benefit election somehow showed as ""cancelled"" at her MyWorkDay.About two weeks ago, she had been notified to enroll/update her employee benefits by today 5PM (Oct 31). She told me she simply reviewed and signed everything without changing anything from previous enrollment details (no life changing events, no health changes etc). She has been at this employment (a large luxury company) for exactly about year now.I asked her if she really reviewed/signed, and she swore she did. She barely managed to resubmit her benefit election in time (again, no change from last year). After she took some deep breaths, I asked her to look around why it shows as ""cancelled"" instead of incomplete.In MyWorkDays, you can apparently see which corporate employee took what actions on an employee's certain actions. She said she could see chain of people and their 'actions,' and one of the corporate benefit analysts cancelled her initial submission for some reason. I was really confused why anyone would do that. I asked her to send me the enrollment guideline PDF file, and in the guideline, it said that if no other changes were made, then healthcare coverage (PPO)/life insurance policies will automatically rollover to next year, which I understood as ""if you don't change anything or not take any action, then you will automatically be enrolled in the exact same coverage.""I told her to send an email to all these corporate employees she could see in this chain processes, but if I am optimistically guessing, she should not be worried because as the enrollment guidebook said, if there is no specific change to be made, it will be automatically renewed as exactly same, right? I still don't get why her initial submission was ""cancelled,"" though.Another weird thing is that in her re-submission, there was a date ""Submit the election by Nov 8th"" not October 31st.sorry this is so all over the place...."

[ID] Company wants to add On-Call to my position and not pay for the hours I am making myself available for being on-call. How do I say No and keep my job?,"UPDATED in comments:I am a salaried software support analyst. I came into the position with no experience and I‚Äôve already been asked to start training for a Professional Services position for when I becomes available in the next year. Our team is very small (less than 10) and the company is only five years old. I am at the level of the other support analyst who has been with the company for four years.  In addition to our 40 to 44 hours per week, we alternate one Saturday coverage every three weeks, 8am-12pm from home, only for P1 level tickets. We get a set amount regardless of whether there is a priority call or not. We do not have to work past noon.Last week they informed us that we will be doing after hours coverage through 4 AM in the morning on-call, 7 days in a row every other week. We only get paid if there is P1 ticket.Essentially I will not get paid unless there is a ticket and I will have to sit around the house and be available for a ticket in order to respond in less than 15 minutes.Their argument is that it won‚Äôt put us over 45+ hours because there will be very few tickets so we shouldn‚Äôt be negatively affected at all.My argument is that I should be paid to make myself available so that I can respond in 15 minutes or less. And that I will have to change my private life to accommodate this new responsibility. I will get virtually no Compensation for this.Additionally I feel it will change our customer‚Äôs behavior. I am the only one that is available till 5 PM in our time zone. Which means the customers will now push to get all of their tickets in before the end of the business day and I will have to take all of those and then work more hours because if the ticket is in before 5 PM I don‚Äôt get any extra compensation.I asked if I could have a three month trial on this new program and if I didn‚Äôt like it would I be able to opt out. They said no. I asked if this is optional at all and my supervisor said that we ‚Äúmay‚Äù not have a choice. I replied that I always have a choice, I don‚Äôt have to work here.They have not officially implemented this program and I‚Äôm really stressed out about the situation. Is this fair or equitable in anyway?I will say that they are and have always been very happy by my performance, thrilled with my positive attitude and potential for growth in the company. I solve problems and I‚Äôm proactive problem solver, I don‚Äôt need to be babysat or micromanaged. I‚Äôm a team player and I work really hard. They have always recognize that."

One of my complaints was that part of the reprisals I was receiving for my good work and dedication was being sidelined and excluded from all projects involving my warehouse as well as contracted duties generally given to the warehouse manager.In short the quick fix was separating me from the warehouse where my direct line supervisor and his supervisor find themselves often.

I‚Äôve tried asking my company but it‚Äôs so large of a company every time I try asking for HR, they route me to the insurance company to ask without talking to a real human.Hope this made sense!"
"[NY] Hired as part-time, offered full time, was rescinded, but given full time work for several months...should I have been given benefits?","I know in some states I would have been legally entitled to benefits, but am not sure on New York law. Can someone help shed some light? Thanks!"
[CA] meal and rest breaks,I have worked a 7 hour and 30 minute shift and 7 hour and 45 minute shift. How many breaks should I be getting? I know it‚Äôs one lunch but my work keeps telling me 1 break. I‚Äôve worked at another location in california and they have given me 2 breaks and a lunch.
[NY] Company is made of 85% new employees,"Hi! I am joining a new team with 150 current employees (company is based in NY, but remote) The company is over 12 years now. I just found out that 85% of their team just started (less than a month)- 7 months. I am curious why did they do a mass hiring? And there are more employees joining the next couple of weeks as well. What happened to the old employees? Is this a redflag?"
Being autobotted after an interview? When you‚Äôre an internal candidate? Does that say something about the company? [FL],So a person who has been a dedicated spotless employee for several years wants a transfer to a position and has gone through all the proper channels including getting my bosses blessing and recommendations and reaching out personally to the recruiter and hiring manager as an internal employee to follow up‚Ä¶I get an auto bot ‚Äúsorry not sorry‚Äù message‚Ä¶what‚Ä¶the‚Ä¶fu..? Is this really the way of Human Resources now?
[FL] Can you be classified as both exempt and non exempt,"I was hired onto a job in August as a manager of a small store and was told I would be making a salary. My first few paychecks reflected this being the same down to the cent even though I had just started and definitely wasn't working a full 80 hours. My last two checks, however, have been short. When I asked the owner about this he informed me that I am hourly up to 80 hours and salaried after 80 hours. I'm pretty sure this isn't legal but want to make sure before I take it further. I should also add we are paid on the 15th and 30th so the pay periods aren't exactly two week periods."
[SC] [TN] [WY] ADHD Disclosure Advice,"Greetings HR Professionals,What is your advice regarding disclosing an ADHD diagnosis? I'm in the process of making a career change to accounting and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to disclose/be protected under ADA or if a potential employer would see that as a liability or hindrance and turn me down (yes, I realize they will never say that's why they are turning me down but I'm not naive). Thanks in advance."
Team Lead or Project Manager? [INDIA],"I was hired by this X company as a Project Manager. I work in Marketing and internally everywhere I am referred to as a Project Manager. We are client facing so the client is also aware of my title as a Project Manager.However officially on paper, my job title is Team Lead. What should I write in my resume? I don't want to lie.I perform all the responsibilities of a project manager and everyone who is hired as a team lead in our company is referred to as a Project Manager, so it's just that the company is hiring candidates as TL and not PM.I'm planning to mention project manager in my resume and list all responsibilities I've performed and in any potential future interviews I appear, I can let them know in the interview that my official title it TL.Please advice. Thanks."
[CA] Failed background check,"I  work IT for a healthcare company in California, recently we had a guy that's moving to Singapore to work fully remote and we urgently needed to hire someone to replace him. We grouped interviewed a candidate and he was available to start immediately. During the interview we asked if his background check will come up with anything we should be aware of and he was truthful in saying that his criminal record is clean, but his credit history/score is a mess.My company decided to hire him on a 2 week contractor basis until his background check clears with HR. On Friday (yesterday) he came back and told me he didn't pass his background check and the reason for that was because HR would not accept his credit history, his criminal record is spotless.Feel bad for the guy as he quit his job expecting to be hired, he told me he has never experienced this before with any previous employer as everyone has less than perfect credit. It makes sense, at least in my mind, because how do  you expect anyone to pay off loans/debt without a job? Question I have is why would a company reject a application based on bad credit history but has a clean criminal history?"
"HR Question: Called in for a meeting, but I don't know what to expect [NY]","I (M45) work at a non-profit in New York City, in the mental health field. I oversee several dozen employees.HR has called me in for a Zoom meeting on Wednesday about an employee relations concern, and I assume I am the subject of a complaint. However they are not able to give me any details so I don't know what to expect, and I'm very worried. This might be about a staffer who may feel that I am obstructing her career path (she didn't like the performance appraisal I gave her, which I believe was fair).Or perhaps it's unrelated to that, and perhaps it has to do with an inappropriate comment I made but don't remember! It's possible, because I often put my foot in my mouth!So my question, how should I prepare myself for this without knowing what it's about in advance? And what is the best way to defend myself and conduct myself in this meeting?"
"[CO] Two months into my job, I am suffering from debilitating mental health problems that are affecting my job capacity","We just fired our manager recently, so I don't have a good relationship with the interim manager who stepped in from another department.I am collapsing mentally under depression, anxiety, and thoughts of self harm. No, I do not need the reddit canned response about suicide help, I have discussed it with family and am looking for a therapist.Needless to say, my capacity to focus and do my job is rapidly diminishing.I do not believe I qualify for FMLA, only been with the company for 2 months.What should I do? I am in software and work remotely."
[VA] Is it me or my supervisor?,"I‚Äôve been working for a new company in VA for about 4 months now. I absolutely love it, but I‚Äôve been bumping heads with my supervisor recently for some reason. I accepted this role as a Senior Project Manager and was told during the interview process that it was everyone‚Äôs expectation that I would move into the Project Director role within a year. Growth is why I left my last company (absolutely loved it there, too, but no growth opportunities) so this role sounded perfect for me. Not to mention it‚Äôs fully remote!It‚Äôs a much smaller company so I also have weekly check-ins with our COO and CFO. They are both fantastic and I enjoy working with them. My supervisor was put into the Acting Project Director role for the time being, in addition to her other job as our Talent Director. She let me know up front she‚Äôd be learning from me and that‚Äôs great because I love a team mentality!However, in the past 30 days, something has shifted. For example, I came back a day earlier from PTO and Teams showed me as out of office still. I told her I‚Äôd fix it and less than 10 minutes later she called me and asked me why I hadn‚Äôt updated it yet. I told her I was quickly finishing up a task and would do it right after. She gave me a firm ‚Äúdo it now while we‚Äôre on the phone so I can make sure I can see the change.‚Äù I just brushed it off.Another example ‚Äî I had to go into the office last week to meet with other team members and I turned my phone on silent for the 2 hour meeting. When I checked my phone during a break period, I had 7 messages from her asking where I was and if I was working today because Teams showed me as away all morning (I went straight into the office). When I reminded her I had the onsite meeting, she immediately back tracked and said she didn‚Äôt know I was going in for the meeting‚Ä¶. that she asked me to attend‚Ä¶. Now I‚Äôm beginning to think she has a trust issue.Another time she asked me to consolidate two spreadsheets into one, even though the team said sending separate was just fine. I let her know I had already cleared it with them and she said, ‚ÄúI expect that when I give you direction you‚Äôll do it.‚Äù I was a little taken aback by that.There have been other comments she‚Äôs made, but in short I let her know on Friday afternoon that while I have a great amount of respect for her, I‚Äôm feeling a little micromanaged. All she said was ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get on the same page next week.‚ÄùAm I in the wrong here? Our COO informed me last week he‚Äôs been getting great feedback from the team about me and he‚Äôs pleased with the progress I‚Äôve been making. I‚Äôm feeling a little crazy. I pickup every call and respond to emails within the hour even when I‚Äôm on PTO most of the time. I worked at my last job remotely for four years under a female boss and she was so wonderful! How should I approach her next week without being disrespectful but also letting her know how I‚Äôm feeling?"
[OK] My manager is abelist?,"A few days ago, she proceeded to talk to me and one other coworker about a new hire. She found out that this person has dyslexia and had she known that, she wouldn't have hired her. But she said she can't ask questions like those in interviews because it's ""discrimination."" Then she threatens me and the other coworker that if what she just told us gets out or leaves that room we will be written up.She also cut hours of my other coworker who has arthritis and that girl had to quit to find a new job because she couldn't survive on 5 hours a week. Seriously, what should I do? Something feels wrong about this situation. I feel conflicted bc my manager is a single mom who works two jobs and is barely making it, but this felt really unsettling."
[PA] Staff discussing my past personal trauma etc. I need help.,"Hi everyone I need advice.I‚Äôm going to try to make this as easy as possible to understand.I am a nurse.I recently took a new position as a clinic supervisor/nursing supervisor.I have no relationship with my father due to abuse I endured as well as my mother and brother.We went to trial, he did serve some jail time etc. He was not found guilty on all counts. I was 14/15 at the time of trial when everything came to a head and I disclosed my abuse.Fast forward to now; after years of counseling/therapy etc. I am at a point in my life where I can cope with most triggering situations etc.I took this new position. Two of my nurses know him. One of them is best friends with some of his best friends.I was informed on Friday (my 5th day in this position) that said nurse has told my other nurses that I lied about abuse allegations etc."
[CA] Sterling background check - HS Diploma,"I‚Äôm still in college but I got accepted to a big company in CA. Sterling is asking for a proof of my high school degree. I did it outside the US.Our diplomas were not ready yet during our graduation lol. We can claim it now but not until November 4 because they are on break. I am supposed to start on November 8.I uploaded a copy of my transcript and it says there that I have graduated already from that school. Is that enough?Should I call and ask them and explain my situation? I‚Äôm having second thoughts about calling them because they might not even think it‚Äôs an issue. And my calling might suddenly make it a big deal.But then, not calling and explaining might raise suspicions. Then I won‚Äôt have time to explain myself."
[TX] What my employer knows about their employees' medical history?,This is just a generic question.  I got my health insurance through my employer.   Do they know what kind of medication we are take without knowing who's taking them?  Or what medical conditions we have?
[WA] Formal written warning ??,"Somewhat long.... Okay so I've been with my company for 5.5 years now. Never been in trouble until recently.About 4 months ago a coworker of mine returned to work after her maternity leave. We had previously butted heads but were okay because we didn't work the same shift, when she returned to work she transferred to my (graveyard) shift.Within a few days we were starting to have some issues that spiraled out of control. I lost my temper and made a rude hand gesture at her in a fit of pique. I immediately turned myself into my on duty supervisor for doing it once I cooled down. I went as far as turning myself in to HR because I felt guilty and realized that I'd gotten hot headed. At the time I was given a verbal warning and signed an acknowledgement of such.Yesterday my manager came in to work a day shift and asked me to step into her office. I did, not aware of what was coming. She informs me that she has had reports from several departments that I have been spreading ""malicious gossip"". She informs me that I'll be receiving a formal written warning. When she gave it to me it listed 2 dates, but no specifics about the incident (s) that supposedly happened (basically it said ""on day X and day Y you spread malicious gossip"" no times or places or anything).I signed the write up because I didn't really feel like I had much choice.When I got home I called our HR department to request a meeting but am unsure how to prepare. I feel frustrated that in the span of 4 months I somehow went from never in trouble to a full write up. No mitigating steps were taken in the interim and no guidance was provided by my manager.So when I meet with HR....how can I clearly communicate my issues without making it seem like I'm blaming my boss?"
[MD] I've reached 1 month since I was told an offer is coming...,"This whole situation is bizarre just looking for some thoughts on whether this should be concerning or not from people who work in the field.On 9/30 I was informed by my recruiter (a third party firm the company uses - not in-house) that I was the candidate they wanted to move forward to offer with. I was extremely excited. But that excitement faded a bit as days and weeks passed. To her credit, the recruiter proactively kept in touch over the last month every week or so telling me the same thing ""no news yet, I know they're still waiting on approvals for the offer."" Which I thought was odd to take so long, an offer in my experience always comes within a couple days not weeks. Budget cuts? Second guessing my fit?I got a bit more information yesterday as we approached the 1-month mark. She again apologized for no news yet, but this time added ""we are waiting on some approvals which I hope will make the offer more attractive.""That bit explains the delay if they had to re-grade the salary, but also kind of strange... I gave them my salary range months ago at the initial phone screen. And in fact, after going through the interview process, I felt as if I priced myself LOW and the top of the range I gave should really be more like the minimum I should accept.This is a massive international company with a HQ in Europe.As my friends and family keep checking in with me ""have you received the offer yet?"" they also give me their opinions that the company is messing with me, or maybe I'm not the first candidate, or maybe this is a sign it's not the greatest company to work for if it takes a month to piece together a job offer.After this latest email, I feel like I'm mentally preparing for a lowball offer, but I know it's not worth overthinking it until the offer actually comes. Adding to my unease is that I don't dislike my current company/employer, this is just a nice promotion and (I thought) would be a large raise.Looking for advice here on how I should frame my thinking, whether this is a yellow or red flag situation, and any questions I might want to ask when the offer does come in."
[MN] Non-disclosure from previous job?,"Apologies, I'm new to reddit and am on mobile, but I have a question about what HR people are allowed to talk about.Several years ago when I was young, I worked at a bank. For various reasons, I stole a small amount of money. I wasn't caught directly, but we had an internal audit the next day and my drawer was found to be short. They did end up firing me, but they were nice and the official reason was not blatantly that I had stolen. I have almost no doubt that they knew I stole, but they were saving face. Obviously HR was involved in my firing and likely knew the true reason.Years later, I'm now at a new company doing basic customer service work in an office for over 1 year. Come to find out this HR person was just hired at my new company and will be working in my office. I'm terrified they will reveal what happened at the bank and I will lose my job. I have been an outstanding citizen ever since and a really excellent employee, but can this HR person tell my new company about what happened with me?Thanks!"
[PH] They cancelled on me twice,"Hi, i was previous employee at a company here in the Philippines and I decided to work with them again. First was I passed my initial interview and final interview plus completing all of my requirements on time. What they did here is they cancelled the start date since the client was no longer looking for agents to hire yet I tried messaging the recruiters multiple times yet a week prior my start date yet they never replied to my messages and I only heard from them 2 days prior my start date telling me that it's cancelled. The second time was I messaged recruitment if they have any accounts available and they told me there was. I applied to that account and they invited me to a job offer discussion and all and when there was a week left I messaged them again to get an update since I never heard anything from them yet they still didn't reply, now two days prior my start date they tell me that I'm no longer eligible for re-hire again. They made go through all the trouble of doing a medical check up and processing my requirements and that's what they tell me. This is just really messed up, they had a lot of time to tell me that I'm no longer eligible for re-hire yet they still gave me false hope."
[uk] HR and probation,Just wondering how usually goes in other placesDoes your HR reach out and say you‚Äôve passed even though your manager has already done so or does HR not reach out to you after passing let‚Äôs you continue working
[CA] asked to check with potential future direct reports before an internal job interview,"I have been with a company a little under a year and an opening that would be a promotion on our team team - in fact - 2 jobs opened up. When I asked to apply I was told to check with specifically one of the many direct reports by the hiring manager before I could apply. When we talked, he said he was interested as well and as there were two positions I encouraged he apply as well and told the hiring manager he had an interest and it sounded like we‚Äôd support each other if one or both of us got the job(s).He approached the hiring manager - said it was awkward - and didn‚Äôt apply. I still interviewed and then no one talked to me about it for weeks and told they had a ton of other candidates so I assumed I was interviewed as a courtesy and forgot about it. 3 weeks after the initial interview got notice I was going to be moved on and would interviewed by some potential direct reports including the colleague they made me ‚Äúcheck with‚Äù - then I was told to say nothing until they were spoken to about my candidacy ahead of my interview - which was also really awkward.I said nothing, but the colleague I mentioned earlier confronted me because he saw the interview on our manager‚Äôs calendar. Then I sort of walked stuff back since they‚Äôd not had a chance to talk and I didn‚Äôt want detail to slip before the manager had spoken to them. He and I ended that conversation with him being supportive. He then confronted the manager and said he was not comfortable with me managing him and never gave me a real Blessing to interview unless he was promoted to one of the positions with me and the hiring manager was apparently very upset and seemed upset with me for bitching this whole thing by confirming my interview and trying to walk it back. I now have a 1:1 with the hiring manager at 9am Monday so my weekend is shot - can I lose my job over this? I assume I‚Äôm getting pulled from the running, but part of me feels this is on management for putting me in the position to seek permission from a possible direct report to interview in the first place. Also, HR has not been involved at all. Just this hiring manager and me so I don‚Äôt know if this is like even official. I‚Äôm dreading Monday.Can I be fired for this? Can I lose out on the opportunity?"
[UK] Need help with management!,"My manager presented me with documentation of a meeting we had and requested I sign it. The document included the statement ""Fwoggy7 suffers from anxiety and week commencing 10th of October had been stressful for personal medical issues. These anxiety issues were disclosed prior to starting this role in job and were stated to be under control, however observations have shown that this is not the case."". After reading the document I stated that I disagreed with this implication that my anxiety disorder is out of control and explained that it is as under control as it can be, also disclosing that I have completed a course of medication and talking therapy as proof of this. By stating my disagreement and explaining why I disagreed I had expected the statement to be removed, however management disagreed with me, accused me of lying about the reason for my sickness absence the week prior (my fiance had covid and I had all the symptoms but negative lat flows, she said that she believes it was anxiety related) and disregarded what I had said. Instead she chose to make an addition mentioning that I have had therapy. She then asked if I would like anything changing and, as I had already stated that I was unhappy with a statement and was shut down, I said no because I felt that pushing the matter would have negative repercussions. I felt like this because in the morning huddle that day she had made a point of thanking two other staff members who had also been sick for persevering and asking after their wellbeing whilst ignoring myself, then proceeding to accuse me of lying about my sickness later in the day. I signed the document because I felt pressured and like I had no other choice because I feared repercussions if I didn't. I planned to raise this with a higher up manager the next day. She failed to mention in the document that she was a cause of a lot of stress due to the fact that she threatened me with a transfer during the meeting. She used the words ""You will not lose your job because of this but I will transfer you because I cannot use you."" and told me that she would find me a suitable job in the labs. She was aware of this fact, as I had made her aware and she informed me that I ""must must must stop worrying"".I would also like to make note that during my first week in the position she reprimanded me for not disclosing at interview that I have mild eczema and interrogated me about any other health conditions I had that she was unaware of. This meeting was not documented.I spoke with the higher manager and managed to get the document changed to ""These anxiety issues were disclosed prior to starting this role in job and were stated to be under control, whilst I acknowledge that her anxiety is under control, Fwoggy7 can sometimes appear upset."" which I'm not 100% happy with but was the best compromise I could get. I've had a second meeting since with the higher manager regarding this mangers behaviour and have basically been told it's a he said she said situation and therefore she won't be taking it further. They haven't documented either of these meetings. I feel like I'm losing my mind though, this behaviour isn't acceptable right? And why does she want to make out on my record that I'm an anxious mess when I'm not? I've discussed it with other co-workers and they were surprised I even have an anxiety disorder, they couldn't tell! I've directly told management that it feels like they're building a case in order to transfer me and they've sworn up and down they aren't but I can't shake the feeling?Someone please set me straight here, am I'm being paranoid or are they being weird?"
[CA] Reasonable accommodation?,"If an employer is asking for a medical accommodation to be filled out and a doctors note attached to the accommodation, can a prior doctors note (say 2018) that says the condition is permanent be used? For example ""my patient John Doe has a permanent condition that requires... would this note be acceptable or does the note need a current date? Thank you"
"[MN] Question on if my HR office, which takes forever to answer questions, is even worth going to about issues?","I work for a large company. Over the course of the recent (and even distant past) I have experienced different levels of harassment due to me being in a protected class. Other coworkers have experienced some levels of harassment because they are a minority. I have gone to middle management in the past with no luck, and tbh some retaliation. My HR director takes weeks, even sometimes months to get basic yes/no questions answered.Should I even bother going to HR if they take say 3 to 4 weeks to answer a question on timesheets or on simple policies? I have thought about just quitting but my friend who used to work in HR said I must do what is right, and at least try to go to HR.If an HR department consisted of 1 person and that 1 person took 3 to 4 weeks or even months to respond to a simple email, why should/would I or anyone for that matter go to them over a complex workplace issue such as harassment? If I was to quit I have enough evidence to get a small number of people fired for being openly sexist and racist. Tbh if my HR department was functional I would not even be on here asking this question."
Car Damaged While On The Clock [SD],"I work for a company with many locations. I was driving my personal vehicle to another location due to a staffing shortage and was on the clock. During the drive, my tire was punctured (big hole) by an object I never saw in the road (dark). I went to a tire repair shop and asked if it could be fixed. They said it was unrepairable due to the amount of damage and stated this on the receipt. I had the damaged tire replaced as well as the tire on the other side because otherwise it can cause damage to your drive components since one is more worn than the other. Is my employer responsible for covering the cost of repair ($375)? If so, should I ask for full or partial reimbursement? I do receive the IRS mileage, but from what I understand that is meant to cover normal wear and tear, not damage. My insurance isn't an option due to a high deductible."
[NC] getting rehired and background check‚Ä¶,"I was recently laid off due to a RIF at my company. I was encouraged to reapply to some open positions, and I found one that I was very interested in, and applied. I‚Äôve gone through two rounds of interviews so far, last one was last Friday but I still haven‚Äôt heard back. Could this be a good thing? Bad thing? Just neutral?Also‚Ä¶ I got a DWI back in 2020 while I was still employed with the company, and now I‚Äôm super nervous that in the event I do receive an offer, the pending charge will come up on my background check (yes, still pending from 2020‚Ä¶ thanks Covid). Could they reject me because of this, even though I was employed by them for 2 and a half years after getting the DWI charge?"

[TX] is my manager trying to transfer me to a different team without telling me ?[HR],"5 weeks into new job. During last one on 1 with manager, he asked me questions like "" do you feel like people are being able to answer ur questions timely..if not please don't hesitate to reach out and ask anyone "" and ""do you need anything, like a better desk or anything to help you with your work""He then told me he had some assignments for me, but had to reset his password before i could start. Told me he would ping me when he reset it . He did ping me about something related to the assinment (told me to cc xyz person whe. I was done with assignment ) but he did not tell me he reset password.I didn't realize he had reset it until I checked the Google doc myself right before the end of my shift.obviously it was too late for me to start on my assignment by then.Looked for the assignment first thing in the morning the following day. Couldn't find it. Went into his office. He told me they were with him(he took them from my.desk lol) and gave them to someone else. He basically took them away and reassigned to another coworker.2 days later, team lead from our department  emailed me saying they wanted to check in and see how training was  going and to discuss""next steps"" . Team lead says he'll meet with me after he ""received more information about MY ACTUAL TEAM PLACEMENT ""But to be fair, he asked a few weeks earlier whether I heard from team lead and told me that I would be doing what I'm doing currently for  a few more weeks before moving onto something elseIn our very first meeting 5 wks ago, he told me he moved someone because he felt like she wasn't catching onto things after bring explained things multiple times and that he just ""got a feeling "" it wouldn't work outdoes this mean I'm being moved to a different team?does this mean my boss doesn't like want me on his team anymore ?"

"[IL] Moving on to a new job, when to put notice.","Hello all,I am currently moving within my same field, but to a different institution. I have a couple of concerns. I was offered the job, have benefits, but since my job has to be approved by the board, I have to wait until the 16th to make it official. From what I understood, their hr department said that they have never seen it not go though. I was hoping to put in my 2 weeks notice next week, giving them 2 full weeks, and enough time for me to burn some floating holidays I have.My concern is that for some reason I don‚Äôt get the job, would I be out of my current job too? They said that after approval, I would get next steps, etc. I was told I‚Äôd be screened for hard drugs, etc, background check.Would it be safer to just wait till the 16th?"
[FL] I have misused my responsibility for personal recreation at my student job as an international student. What are the consequences.,"So, I have this job for over 2 months where I work at the compute lab and purchase hours for gaming room users. I have played in the university gaming room since my freshman year and have spent over 700$ so far. However, I had to get a job this semester as I was in a financial trouble. I thought using the system admin access to add hours to my personal account was just like eating at the back as a restaurant server (maybe I just rationalized so). Anyways, I had a talk with my supervisor and director and they said ER are reviewing my case. I am extremely worried because I just wanted to use the esports room for recreational purposes. Because I am an international student, I am worried the consequences might be more than simply being fired. Maybe I am overthinking, but I need advice on what I should expect and what I could do. I have emailed my supervisor and ER with additional details and now waiting for their reply.Upd 1: Investigation will be over within a week and they are planning to have a discussion with me. I will post the updates. I talked personally with my supervisor and said he will do his best so I can ‚Äúresign‚Äù from my job as I explained how damaging it might be for me if they fire me."
[WA] Paycheck delayed?,"Small business, two owners, I'm the manager. I handle everything but paychecks/bills. I ran payroll on Monday, the owner forgot to finalize it, now says it should be paid out on November 1st.He said to let him know if we need money to cover financial responsibilities until then. I made an announcement to the staff telling them payroll had a delay, it should be paid by Nov 1st, tell owner if you need money to cover financial responsibilities.What else do I need to do? Any bases I need to cover?"
[CA] Aggressive Co-Worker,"I have a co-worker (not supervisor) who has been acting aggressive by yelling, demeaning me. This isn‚Äôt the first time but the most recent situation was due to his belief that we should show up an hour early to be ready to start in case the team before us finishes early. I showed up 15 minutes before my scheduled time and he flipped out and escalated when I told him I wouldn‚Äôt show up an hour early just to sit around waiting. I spoke to my supervisor who said it wasn‚Äôt a policy and the co-worker couldn‚Äôt enforce that, but the supervisor is very non-confrontational and won‚Äôt do anything like speak to the co-worker about the behavior. Some other co-workers I asked about it said they wouldn‚Äôt show up early but he‚Äôs a well-liked guy so nobody‚Äôs vocally pushing back against it. I looked online to see if this issue could be reported to HR but all the definitions of workplace harassment or hostility are for protected categories or sexual in nature. He‚Äôs not doing that, just being incredibly unpleasant. Is this something that I could/should report to HR?

[DK] Am I being referred?,"For a bit of context, I have graduated three months ago, and I am searching for a job for the past month or so.Today I had a casual chat with a guy I know from a couple of projects in school, he is the head of the department at the company I definitely see myself working at, and the chats with him are very casual and laid back, talking about my thesis and recent project he is dealing with at the moment. At the end of the conversation, he said that they are currently wrapping up a lot of projects so they are not hiring, but it might change soon and that I should upload my CV and everything required on to their hiring website.Now, there is a question in the form that I am just filling in on that website that asks if I am referred by one of the employees. Can I consider his invitation to upload my profile to be a referral?I have had some really good conversations with this guy and I think I left a fairly good impression, so naturally, I don't want to mess it up by doing this the wrong way...Thank you all in advance!"
[VA] Employer accidentally sent me a term letter,"I received a document to sign over email informing me that my position was ending due financial reasons. I signed it. I spent 24 hours assuming today would be my last day. I started to offboard myself on our self service website and spent my evening incredibly stressed trying to plan for the future.It occurred to me that it was odd that no one had talked to me about it otherwise, so I asked to confirm that it was the case. This morning I learned it was a mistake.Obviously I‚Äôm thankful to still be employed. But is there anything I should do about this? Is it worth making a fuss about? What could they even do to rectify this? Do I have any grounds to ask for anything?"

"[VA] [USA] Virginia, US - Being paid for two weeks after two have passed since said two weeks.","Virginia, US Thanks to all who read this!To start off, I don‚Äôt like confrontation and I got this job through a friend so I‚Äôm hoping this is a benign issue.I began working at this computer store a few months ago and we do bi-weekly pay, which I‚Äôm used to so I wasn‚Äôt thinking too much about it at the time.The issue arises when I‚Äôve come to realize that pretty much every pay I get is actually the pay for the two weeks I worked preceding the two weeks that have come to an end. This might be normal, but in my experience I‚Äôve always been paid for each two weeks AS they finish not as the next one does.That aside, I‚Äôve already had to come to my boss with bank statements and statements from our timesheet app to show him that he‚Äôs missed pay for pay periods on TWO separate occasions. He apologized and commented that he called the timesheet app‚Äôs support line to figure out why this has happened, but that‚Äôs all I know that he has done.I work alone and the only other individual who works in my dept.** hasn‚Äôt said anything to me about it, and even if he did, he been friends with the owner for a long time it seems.TL;DR - I am getting my two-weeks worth of pay two weeks after said two weeks is completed and I wanna know if that is fine or if I should be doing something? It is irksome especially since I find myself in need of money so often.** (dept. in this instance meaning my boss owns and has stake in multiple companies that he oversees IT wise but I work in the IT company he actually owns)"
[UK] HR being unreasonable with Unpaid Leave request,"My  work got new management at the start of the year and it's been awful  since then. I am currently on sick leave for burnout and after that I  want to take 3 months of Unpaid Leave which is allowed in the staff regulations. I applied for the Unpaid Leave but the HR were coming up with ever increasing and more complex rules to be able to take this unpaid leave. These new rules are not written anywhere and when I asked the HR about it, I was told by the Head of HR that I just have to take his word for it as he has the final say.It was already disconcerting, but finally I jumped through all the hoops and submitted the official application. My manager and the mid-level HR person approved it, each of them taking about a day to do it, but now it's been stuck with the Head of HR for a  week and I have been given no info for why it's stuck.I'm already so stressed out and this situation is stressing me out even more and having a really bad impact on my mental health. At this point I  feel like they are deliberately messing with me. It would take the HR boss a few mouse clicks to approve the leave, so why isn't he doing it? On the other hand I also acknowledge that I am very very stressed any maybe not seeing things clearly. Is it perhaps normal for him to take a week to approve this?What is your take on it? Is there anything you think I could do to help move things  forward? I was thinking of writing an email on Monday and inquiring for the delay, should I also include that clarity over this would help me reduce my stress and burnout and return to work quicker? Would that be a good way to phrase it?"
[CT] Current dept attempting to influence future compensation for new role. Discrimination as an internal candidate?,I spoke with the recruiter who told me I would be better off quitting and re-applying to avoid an unsubstantiated job comparison between two departments. This is being used to minimize my salary increase. [CT]
[WA] Pay Transparency and Fraud?,"[WA state] I recently contacted HR to provide the salary ranges for two backfill positions I am posting (Greenhouse if it matters.)The ranges were VERY low  (by 10s of 1000s) compared to the previous hires. When I followed up with HR, they said that was the minimum and the mid point, and that the true max was higher.HR insists that I input the values they provided and sent to me via email. They won't input the ranges themselves, even though they also have to go into Greenhouse for other parts of the process.My concern is that somehow applicants may be mislead during the hiring process.  For example, when an applicant requests the range, which we must provide under WA law once an offer has been made, they would be told this lower range.Also, I believe WA law is changing soon to where we must provide the range upon making an offer, even if the applicant doesn't ask. Same concern.Is there any legitimate reason to provide only the lower half of the range in the internal job system?"
[PA] Recruiter Miscommunication,During my verbal offer I was told/have written down 20 days PTO after my first 90 days (which is what I got at my last job so I didn‚Äôt question it). I just started this week to find out I only have 10 vacation days.There was also miscommunication in a 5% yearly bonus (which was also miscommunicated to another new hire).It‚Äôs my first week and I feel lied to/slighted by the recruiter. The written job offer was kind of vague and gave the pay and the basic medical vision dental benefits.I would like to send an email to my HR rep addressing the vacation days miscommunication because I wouldn‚Äôt have taken the job had I known I‚Äôd only get 10 days‚Ä¶ and I was hoping for some guidance on what to say and still be professional. Thanks!
[MI] Never received sign on bonus and want out of contract,"Bear with me as I‚Äôll do my best to explain. I just started working for a new company and part of my hiring process was signing a contract for a sign on bonus. The caveat to the agreement is that I would need to stay in the specific department for 2 years. Per my understanding of the agreement, I was supposed to receive the first portion of the payout upon hire, the next payout at a year and the final pay out at the two year mark and end of the commitment period. Now here‚Äôs my dilemma‚Ä¶I have already worked for the company for about 2 months (60 days) and haven‚Äôt seen any of the bonus. I have been off of orientation and in my role since before a full month in as well. After rereading the document, I did see that it stated I would receive my pay 45 days after the completion of the commitment payment. My question is, can I use this as a loophole to get out of my contract? Part of the agreement is that I have to stay in my role in my department for the duration of these two years but since I never got the first portion of the payout, can I just have them void my contract? I really don‚Äôt like the new position so if it means sacrificing that chunk of change I would do it.Looking for any type of advice or clarification on this matter and I apologize if I left out info or don‚Äôt make sense, I‚Äôm very emotional about the whole ordeal and my job in general at the moment."
I think my boyfriend is being harassed by HR [CAN-AB],"This situation is so bizzare and I'm honestly just here for some advice because neither of us know what do. Basically my boyfriend (m 21) ""Greg"" recently started his first corporate job. About a month ago there was an anonymous complaint against him. HR told Greg that another male coworker thought he was ""adjusting his crotch too much.""We both thought this was not only a really strange complaint but also strange that HR was telling him not to adjust his own pants so much. Greg got worried so he started actively focusing on keeping his arms on the table while working and he kept waiting to adjust until he got to the bathroom. Just today he had a meeting with HR and his manager because another male coworker had the same complaint.(Important information to the story is that the only people who can see his crotch while he's working are the coworkers to his direct left and right. These coworkers of his are friends with each other and Greg has always gotten the feeling that they don't like him.)Greg now feels extremely uncomfortable. He has actively tried to resolve the problem (which was a weird issue in the first place) and now feels like people are paying attention to his lap all day. Both HR and his manager told him that they had noticed recently that his hands are always plastered to the desks weirdly and that the complaint was strange but because it was the ""2nd strike"" they had to have a meeting with him. They offered him no solutions to the issue and said that they had a no tolerance policy for 3 strikes. But this seems insanely bizzare to us.1st I think a workplace shouldn't be able to tell their employees how often they can adjust their pants.2nd if even HR and the manager admits the complaints are strange and they notice Greg is taking action then why are they acting as if the complaint is official.3rd Greg has no way of defending himself.What if a 3rd complaint comes in? This feels like workplace harassment and like HR is taking part in it. What are Greg's rights here? What can Greg do to defend himself against these frankly inappropriate complaints? Any advice is appreciated.[Edit: I fixed the formatting]"

Part-time or Freelance [FL]?,"So I have a FT job in IT and recently took up a side gig on a W-9. The side gig includes working through with a third-party to write and review assessments for a university. I want to list this role on my resume however, I did sign an NDA so I cannot use the universities name so I've only listed the third-party and the generic job title that they use since they are the ones that pay me. I only get paid for the  items that I work. For example I get paid $10 for each question that I write $5 for question I review and $40 per hour for any meeting (Meetings rarely occur and we've only had 2 within the 4 months I've been with them). My schedule is very flexible as I can work on items whenever I want along as they get done by the specified deadline. I would like to mention that it seems that I do not get a check and instead I get paid via direct deposit exactly what I invoice them for every month untaxed after I've completed work.

Employer using 2 job titles to conceal full time workers excluded from health benefits [MO],"I work for a company that uses annual contracts for W-2 workers.  (Think education and other annual-cycle type jobs.)  I have coworkers who are simultaneously contracted into 2 part-time roles in the same department so that they do the workload (and even have the total job descriptions) of full time workers, but do not get access to health benefits.   If you take the duties of a full time person, and compare them to these contracts, they're identical - just divided into two.We are a large company with over 600 employees, so we're definitely not exempt as a small business, and we're very aware of the thresholds, because part time roles are limited to under 29hrs/week to prevent triggering benefits obligations.  What is the most effective way to pursue action that will rectify this?  HR doesn't care, or doesn't know any better (possible, as our current HR director has no experience in the field).  Upper management seems oblivious, and even offered one of these people a third contract to help him pay for private health insurance (while still excluding him from company insurance).  I think an outside report is probably going to be essential to get this corrected.  Who do I report to?"
[KY] Potential Inappropriate Behavior?,"Hey all, have a bit of a conundrum regarding a coworker.He and I have worked at the same company for a bit over two years now. We used to work in the same department, but that changed about a year ago.I have reported this coworker to HR twice- once for sexual harassment and once for retaliation after that report. Due to the nature of the incidents reported, and the fact that the comments were made only to me, he is aware that I am the person who reported him. Both times HR investigated, and I was told he admitted wrongdoing.Now, he is contacting me via internal messaging systems about non-work related matters once to twice per week. I do not respond or encourage him to message me in any way. However, the continued contact has made me very uncomfortable. Recently, he has started responding or messaging me on other systems asking why I am not responding to him.My question is- how can I tell him to leave me alone? I don't want to run to HR if this is something I can handle myself, but I'm not sure what the ideal response from me would look like. I feel extremely uncomfortable as I feel like this may be a form of intimidation (since he knows I made the initial reports).Thanks in advance for your time and expertise."
[CA] Multiple accusations by my boss,"I‚Äôve (32F, coder) been working for my company for a year and almost 5 months remotely. Since then, my boss has been accusing me of starting work late, leaving work early, and not working at all. This morning was the 4th time she‚Äôs asked me about my timestamps and productivity. I get paid salary so I don‚Äôt clock in or out. I‚Äôm an adult, I‚Äôm capable of keeping my schedule with full knowledge of being tracked on my work computer. These accusations has made my anxiety full blown to the extent where I hate my job now, afraid to get any type of emails from anyone, attend group meetings with the fear of getting called out, and thoughts I‚Äôll be losing my job. My timestamps are based off a report of the coding system I use daily. Every morning I have my routine, 8am: turn on computer, open all applications, open emails, read and respond if need be. Takes about 12-14 mins before I actually start working, normal right? Even people who work IN OFFICE, do not run to their desk at 8am and start work right away. I used to work in office previously and not one person has ran to their desk at 8am and started working within mins. NEVER! So I‚Äôm at this point where I want to make a complaint to HR. The 3 previous times She‚Äôs accused me by email, I‚Äôve responded with screenshots of my calendar, old emails, and explanations and NO RESPONSE from her! No peace of mind as an employee what so ever! Is going to HR a good idea or will it make things worse? I don‚Äôt feel safe at my job because of their inaccurate reports and my anxiety i through the roof everyday. Im currently looking for another job to leave but considering the holidays, it‚Äôs been difficult. Advice? I hate it here. Also, isn‚Äôt this harassment? I‚Äôve told her MULTIPLE times those timestamps aren‚Äôt true!"

"[Ca] - California - found out I need surgery, but quit old job and waiting to start new job in 3 weeks. Options??","Hi All! I‚Äôm in California.As the title suggests, I quit my job of almost 5 years and gave 2 week notice this week. For 4 of those years, I had an awesome position but wanted to grow with the company. I promoted to a new role almost a year ago and I had been miserable so I started applying for jobs. I was offered a great opportunity that was beyond my dreams! So I accepted the new job, submitted my resignation to my current employer, and will be starting with my new company in 3 weeks.For some time, I‚Äôve been dealing with some health issues. I‚Äôve been seeing Dr‚Äôs trying to figure out a diagnosis. I just learned today that I may require brain surgery to remove a pituitary tumor but waiting for a neurosurgeon to confirm and schedule the surgery if necessary. Once the surgery is done, the recovery might take 3-4 weeks to at least return to working from home.My first thoughts have been around my new job. Again, don‚Äôt know how long I can postpone surgery. The paid/sick leave at mg new job is accrued bi-weekly, but even if I saved it, I wouldn‚Äôt have enough paid leave to cover my recovery. Overall, I‚Äôm afraid of possibly being fired of my boss isn‚Äôt understanding and my new job isn‚Äôt protected by FMLA.I understand my health comes first, but without my job, health insurance, and income‚Ä¶ there is no way I can afford this surgery alone while keeping my family afloat. From what I understand, I wouldn‚Äôt qualify for FMLA in Ca because I need to work with an employer for at least 12 months. Beyond what I know about FMLA, Im not familiar with state disability insurance, unemployment benefits, or any other state benefits‚Ä¶At this point it seems that my only recourse is tostart mg new job but postpone my surgery as long as possible so I can get FMLA, orrescinding my resignation and staying with my current employer so that I can qualify for FMLA, orstarting my new job, doing the surgery, taking unpaid leave from my employer after I use up my PTO/sick leave‚Ä¶ but if I get fired then at least I can get unemployment but I‚Äôll lose my health insurance.What would you all do in my situation? What am I missing there? Do I have any other options I don‚Äôt know about?I appreciate the advice and any suggestions on whether or not I should talk about this with either employer."

However, I soon realized that I had received 3 regular pay deposits and contacted our Finance Director. She said she would correct the matter and that was the end of that. I received one final pay deposit after contacting her.I should also note that during July, August, September and this current month, that I was asked to stay on around 15 hours contract virtually. I billed and was paid for my contract hours for July, but did not bill for August or September (and haven't yet for October) due to me being paid my regular salary and I didn't feel right about it.I have now been invoiced to pay back what they are calling a payroll error (around $7K after accounting for all my leave payout).My question is legally, do I have to pay it back? Is it worth contacting an attorney on this or should I bill them for the two months that I did contract work and have that subtracted from what they overpaid?

In September he told me ‚Äúbecause everything is still in flux, you'll be paid full commission"". Then earlier this month, a few days before payday he said ""I never said that you'd be paid in full, I said I'd try to get you paid"".Because he said I would be paid in full I told my gf about it the day it happened as it was a weight off my shoulders. As well, we booked a small vacation because I thought I was going to have extra money. (Side note: my gf clearly remembered me telling her. Her thoughts were that because the company was getting together (everyone flying into town from around the country) that he did not want me to being up the issue while around the whole company or with my real boss.)Unfortunately, none of it was true. Because of that and several other issues over benefits l'm reaching out to HR (I've already tried going to my current boss and his boss, the owner) because it doesn't seem like they are holding up their contractual obligations based on the information on my starting docs.Could I, or rather should I bring up that my boss lied to me?

I‚Äôm more used to hourly pay, but it didn‚Äôt make sense to me that he can take off days of my pay, despite claims  being flatly paid the whole week? There were some days he would give us two days off as a trade off for sat/ sun, and other times, my numbers were lower compared to what he paid my other employer. I still have access to the financial info.I recall agreeing to something because in my employers eyes, I didn‚Äôt fully work on the business trips sometimes. But I didn‚Äôt realize the full extend what was my boss marking on my pay check.Also the company did not disclosed that I have PTO before I started working. When I quitted, I never really used it and I wished that I did.I don‚Äôt know if I can push the issue now because I have quitted as of this week and our relationship is very sour right now.

[NE] Being blacklisted by former employer. Any time frame until this is lifted?,"So I was with a company I enjoyed. After 4 years, I eventually left because I was relocating to a different part of the state.  It was my first job out of college and was located near my hometown.A week before giving my 2 week notice, I transfered some personal files from my work computer onto my personal hard drive (digital birth certificate, tax info, etc).  In doing this, I accidentally copied over 20,000+ documents related to work. After this was brought to my attention, I immediately (and voluntarily) handed over my personal hard drive to show I didn't mean anything by it.Long story short, I was essentially terminated 1 week into my 2 week notice by HR and a member of the IT security team ( both located in two different states). After looking at both individuals backgrounds, they had only been with the company for about 6 months before they stumbled onto ""my case"". I feel as if they tried to prove their worth to the company by trying to gaslight me into saying I knowingly took confidential documents (which were work related but not business essential - even though they said they were) and use them against the company.After being removed from the company for 18 months I reached out to HR to see if there is any chance for employment with the company in the future. They said it was highly unlikely.So I want to know if there is a blacklist the company would keep. And if so, is there a way to get off it? If the head of HR leaves and so does the IT security lead, can I explain my case to a new set of individuals? I only ask because I really enjoyed the work and the company. I left with the plan of coming back in a few years after trying out other types of industry related jobs (agriculture based). I worked really hard for the 4 years I was there to make a name for myself and to try and move up the ladder. Even so much so that I would have conversations with the Head of our North America division. I just have the feeling my name was dragged through the mud by two people that don't know me and have no idea what they were talking about with these ""confidential"" documents.Any info from HR individuals would be very much welcome.Edit: the transferred files were all done within minutes so it must have been a drag and drop situation of a folder that contained sub folders and so on. Also, the comments really opened my eyes to how serious an outsider takes this without any detailed context - similar to the individuals in my story.

I told my manager about this and told her I would take all the Fridays off in November because we are so busy I don't take a whole week of vacation, and Fridays are usually not as crazy. She was ok with this, and now she sent me an email asking me since November is a busy month with critical work. Will you be able to address critical work it arrives when you are off? I already responded yes to her, but I can't help to feel exploited. It is only her and me in the department. She has taken multiple vacations since I joined. She never responded to email/slack when she was on vacation, even though she said she would, especially when I joined the company. She also is on vacation in the first week of November."
[OH] Sign-On Bonus payback ‚Äútime‚Äù question,"Hi all - I worked for a company that gave me a $5k sign on bonus with a 2 year commitment in Ohio. I left the company after a 1 year and 3 months due to the long hours and environment‚Ä¶ My question is this: they are asking me to pay back the full $5k in full in 30 days, but there was no ‚Äúpayback date‚Äù listed on the (separate page) agreement I signed, simply ‚Äúyou must pay back the full sign on bonus if you leave before 2 years.‚ÄùDo I have a right to wait to pay them back? I want to do what‚Äôs right and pay them back, but unexpected medical bills popped up and I can‚Äôt pay right away.Since there was nothing in writing stating I have to pay them back in any time frame, how long do I have the right to pay them back? Thanks all. I‚Äôm happy to provide more information as well.Side Note: this company doesn‚Äôt have Human Resources (I know), their recruiting department handles HR or it goes straight to Legal. So in this case, I‚Äôm working with Accounting and their Legal rep most likely."
[NC] Questions about Pregnant Employee,"Context: I work in public safety with a newly hired employee (May 2022) who told us in July she was pregnant. She is currently not at work and has a ""Dr."" note excusing her to be out until after thanksgiving due to severe morning sickness and anxiety.Where we work there is a 'general' policy in place where if you don't have any sick or personal time, that is grounds for termination if you continually call out. Additionally because she is not eligible for FMLA coverage because she hasn't been employed for a year, she technically isn't entitled to her position. The problem is HR wont touch her. We dont know why and nothing seems to add up.She has worked perhaps a total of 13ish hours for the month of September and about 6 hours for October. She leaves early almost every shift, in fact she probably hasn't worked a full shift since August. What can we do?"
"[CAN] Would attempts to document ""poor performance"" be undermined by inconsistent or non-existent KPIs and job duties?","TL;DR my employer didn't assign me KPIs until after year-end and I feel I've been set up to ""fail"" my annual performance review. I am the only person out of 100+ staff with different metrics and wasn't given time to do my self-assessment. Am I being punished for needing to work hybrid for medical and financial reasons?I've been with my current company for over a year and am approaching my second annual performance review. Last year, I pointed out that the forms used to evaluate employees didn't apply to my role - I am the only person doing a very different job from the majority of our staff and almost none of the criteria was relevant or possible for me. I requested then that my employer set specific KPIs and goals for my position, and asked repeatedly over the next year, but the closest I got was a vague list of ""priorities"" for my department.It wasn't a huge deal for the first 6 months as I reported directly to upper management. My boss had final say on how I spent my time, assigned my projects, and filtered requests from other departments. Some structural changes caused my workload to increase exponentially and I was expected to manage my department's priorities myself, letting my boss know if I ran into issues balancing everything. I have been waving that white flag for months now.Thing is, everything on my plate at this point is considered a ""top priority"". When I warn that adding x deadline threatens y deadline, I'm reminded that both are critical. Every project I have is either ""vital for securing business"" or is vital to allowing someone else to, so no one wants to wait until I finish my current projects nor extend their deadlines. My KPIs were essentially ""meet every deadline, regardless of how many there are and whether or not you agreed it was possible.""My team narrowly missed only one external deadline in 12 months. My boss blamed this on me working hybrid and started looping HR into emails venting frustration, attaching documents with responsibilities of my role that I'd never even seen before. I ended up meeting with HR several times about this and requested a formal accommodation (medically valid) to help me try to meet expectations, but they were puzzled by it all. I couldn't meet expectations without more overtime, but couldn't work more with my commute and health issues - HR felt it was workload, not my health or commute that was the issue, but the meetings alone were delaying projects so things were basically left at ""let's sort this out once everyone has less on their plate""... that was a few months ago.With less than 24 hours until my review, I was emailed a new form to replace the other irrelevant one. Everyone else has had weeks to fill in their form, but my employer won't reschedule mine to give me time to do it while also assigning more projects. The KPIs on the form weren't shared with me prior to this, mostly aren't measurable, and don't align with what I was told last year.I don't think it's based on discriminatory factors (though I am an obvious minority there in a few ways) but I do feel singled out from 100+ employees with the way this is being handled. I know my boss isn't happy that I'm pushing to stay hybrid, but spending 15+ hours a week commuting isn't an option and the open office is harder for me to work in anyways. I was treated great until everyone was asked to return to the office full-time to ""strengthen company culture"". I was told when interviewing that I could work remotely after training if I needed to.I'm not sure if it's sheer ignorance, limiting my ability to secure a raise, or an attempt to document performance issues in case they let me go, but it really bothers me. I've never been written up and actually like my boss, company, and job - I'm just drowning workload wise while I can't even pay my bills.Is this worth taking back to HR? Would a poor review give my employer cause for dismissal even if their methods of assessment are unreasonable and inconsistent? How much can HR intervene on workload or forcing me into the office?"
[MO] How big of a raise is too much to ask for?,"I went back to school as an adult and got a degree in Geography/GIS after a reasonably long career as a restaurant manager.I applied for a GIS technician job at a local internet service provider. I was hired at 52k/year, which wasn't bad for a first gig out of school.I was told when I got hired that the previous GIS coordinator had put in his notice and that he'd give me a crash course and then I'd be on my own. I ended up in charge of the GIS system (at a company for which GIS is an essential function) with four days of experience. Unfortunately for me, I was working at a GIS technician salary but with a GIS Coordinator title.That was 18 months ago. I've been the entire GIS department ever since. (The additional GIS staff they had been discussing hiring never materialized.) I've expanded our webmapping capabilities and made some really slick maps that have been used to great effect in securing some big municipal internet deals and outside financing. Seven months ago, two of our project managers left, and I took on all permitting responsibilities for areas we're digging in. And I'm essential to the company, since we don't have anybody else who works here who has ever even opened the software before.I got a 3% cost of living raise last January (which was before the ridiculous inflation numbers started posting), so I'm making 53500 now.A direct competitor just posted a GIS analyst (not coordinator) job with a salary range of 55k-75k. Glassdoor estimates my position at 71k.Is asking for 70k unreasonable? It seems like an appropriate salary, but it's also 31% more than I'm making now."
[CA] Background check for Recruiter role for life insurance company. Credit score check?,"Hi,I applied for a recruiter role with an investment company. I am just worried about my credit score as it is in the ‚Äú580‚Äùs . Could this hinder my chances at working with the company?"
[CAN] Is this a normal interview process?,"Over a month ago I interviewed for a job. They were hiring for a few different positions in that department. One posting went up shortly after I applied for the job I interviewed for.My interview went well, they immediately asked for references and a potential start date. I heard from a reference that they had contacted them, a second reference said they received one call and attempted to contact them back and was never contacted again. I believe my third reference spoke to them as well.So I made a follow up call, just to ask if they needed or wanted any other information and to touch base about the position. Weeks go by, and I heard nothing until late in the day before a long weekend that they wanted to interview me for a different position. Didn't say much about this other position so I requested information on it. Initially I accepted the interview as I was a little familiar with the role, but after reviewing the job description and speaking with others more familiar with what that position entailed I decided it was not for me and declined the interview.She asked if I was still interested in the other job I applied for or if she should remove my name from the list. I'm still interested in this other job but now I'm a little unsure of this program/department at all. It's been over a month since my interview and two months since I even applied. I'm working full-time right now just looking to move up to a better job but I'm in no immediate need for a job so I'm trying to be patient.So i guess my question is, is this normal? Should I be concerned? Have I damaged my chances of being offered the original job? HELP!"
Boss asked how I knew someone else got a bonus that I am now asking for [CT],"The company I work for is having so much trouble retaining employees. I put my notice in. My last day was supposed to be yesterday, but I said okay to staying a few more weeks per my boss asking me to.I emailed my boss saying okay to stay a few weeks and mentioned that other people in my department were offered a $500 bonus to continue working for a bit longer. I was not offered this bonus. I‚Äôd like to be offered that bonus!She asked me where I heard this. I wanted to make sure that I legally don‚Äôt have to tell her.

[TX] Does adoption of a stepchild qualify for FMLA leave.,"I know normally adopting a child does qualify for FMLA leave. However, if a woman marries a man who has a number of children of various ages, and then the woman legally adopts the children, does that qualify for FMLA bonding leave?"
[TN] Are dot to dot breaks allowed?,"I work 8 hour shifts at a factory in TN and they give us a 10 minute break and a 20 minute break. My job is starting to get strict about going to and back from break saying we have to go to break right on the dot and be back on the dot. For example, our break would be from 8:00-8:10. We have to go to break at 8 and be back on the line by 8:10. I was wondering if this is legal, especially when in a filling room, employers have to be wearing lab coats and other equipment that takes time to put on."

Manager [PA] displaying inappropriate behavior at work,"I've worked for the same company with my boyfriend for the last 3.5 years. We've been together about 2.5 years, and over that course of time, I've had some unsettling feelings about one of the female managers we work with. My boyfriend told me about one year ago that he thinks that ""she has a crush on me"" and that she once said something that he didn't quite hear, but what he thought he heard was a suggestive comment. Over the last couple of months, she's also said some things to me that definitely confirm she has at least been taking the time to develop thoughts about my boyfriend, such as teasing him that other female associates have a crush on him, telling me, ""I mean, it makes sense - good looking guy who's there to help out hahaha right?"" And I just sort of looked at her with a grossed out expression and a sarcastic ""um.. yeah..."" and walked away. The other day we were talking about an Australian woman who comes to visit her dad where we work (we work in healthcare), and she said to me, while my boyfriend was standing right next to me, to ""imagine if he (my bf) had an Australian accent, with his body type, lol you'd be beating women off of him left and right hahaha"" to which I also didn't respond to. Then, a few days later, my boyfriend and a couple of other people in the room were talking about working out. I mentioned as that it was humorous that I used to use a music technique book for guitar lessons called ""pumping nylon,"" that had a flexed bicep on the cover, parodying the Schwarzenegger doc ""pumping iron."" My boyfriend mentioned what Schwarzenegger's arm were and said ""yeah, my measurement is only about 15, Arnold's were like 22."" (Honestly can't remember what he said Schwarzeneggers were, so, sorry Arnold, if I'm misquoting that). She proceeds to walk up to my boyfriend and say ""OH SO LIKE THAT WOULD BE LIKE THIS FOR YOU."" And starts to put her hands around his upper arm to demonstrate the difference. I literally just walked straight out of the room with no words when she she got close enough to make it obvious what she was doing. Thank God I have the kind of boyfriend who just left the room and followed me out, but that was just another obviously degrading behavior on her part. I can let some things go as being human error, because people say and do things sometimes without really catching themselves, but she's done this numerous times. She is at least 11 years older than my 25 year old boyfriend. She is also married, and has four kids. I have talked to him about how I won't accept being treated in a way that makes it seem like I have no concern for how people at work or anywhere else view our relationship, and if he invites behavior like that from others, I have to reconsider our relationship. I refuse to just let things like this happen, and I've been considering talking to HR about it, but don't want to do so if they'll just brush it off. Does anyone have any input as far as what to do would be? I would approach her about it, but it's not my place to do so as much as it is his. He is the one being actively harassed, but I'm also part of this as well, because it reflects on how others see me."
Workplace Relationship [CA],"I have been dating my coworker for a little less than a year. We do not work on the same team and are both not in management. When we first started going out , I checked the policy and read that only relationships involving managers/subordinated had to be reported so I thought we were good. However, I recently checked the policy and it now says all romance and dating relationships must be reported to HR and those who don‚Äôt are at risk of termination. This new policy was released around when we started dating. Now thinking I need to come clean but worried they‚Äôll ask when we start dating. Note: plenty of our colleagues know we‚Äôre dating/ have been dating but not our managers (not the same team). Unsure of how to be honest without jeopardizing our positions. TLDR: We don‚Äôt work together and are in good standing but worried about reporting our relationship as we‚Äôve been violating the policy for almost a year."
[MO] Diverse Pipeline,"One of my firms is currently recruiting for a managerial position.

[CA] last pay is late due to HR and Supervisor oversight,"Need advise on how to deal last pay issues in CAHello good fellows.I have recently quit from my employer, the 14th was my last day and I gave them ample amount of time for resignation. I worked 40 hr weeks and get paid weekly in bay area CA.Last day of employment I got a call from HR for formality sakes. The usual you'll get your last pay direct deposited, benefits end dates and so on.I only received a pay check for prior week of pay and accumulated PTO. I still had 40hrs of last week not accounted for. Nothing was delivered over the weekend and was told I had to wait till next pay cycle which is every Friday for company. Friday comes along and no deposit notification. I contacted the HR rep and was told there were no hours submitted when they should of been so I wasn't paid due to HR and supervisor oversight. Now I have to wait until the following Friday.They have confirmed that I would be paid on the 28th for my 40 hrs I was missing. I know in California there is the waiting penalty for employer who fails to pay out all wages in 72 hours of termination. I have let them know I would be entitled to receiving compensation for the late payment and now I have been left on read since then. Any advise on this since it's been 2 whole weeks now that I haven't been paid."
HR Benefits Enrollment [NC],"Posting for a friend whos having a lot of personal issues on top of this so I don't have the exact dates as of yet but, She was just hired on for a new international company that has various campuses throughout the US.

Attempts were made 2 to 3 weeks before the end of enrollment and throughout the following month to get it resolved. The number finally got resolved but they are telling her she's stuck with what she automatically enrolled with.

[TX] Asking HR for a schedule change due to my mental health,"Hello everyone, I first wanted to apologize if this was not the appropriate reddit page to post this is in. I have been working for Blue Cross Blue Shield call center for 2 years now and every 6 months they change your shift schedule to whatever they please and find fit at the time, which is annoying as this could really mess up with people‚Äôs outside of work lifestyle. They scheduled me 4 day weeks working 10 hours daily. We are in Annual Enrollment Period and the calls are back to back to back to back my entire shift. During Annual enrollment they want us to work 2 mandatory hours of OT a day because of all the calls. That means I have been working 12 hour shifts. This has really messed with my mental health as I am feeling extremely depressed and anxious and absolutely dread having to take calls. I am the only one in my team that got stuck with a 4x10 schedule out of 35 people, why? I have no idea, but I knew I would hate it. My direct manager states she can not do nothing about it and I have to reach out to HR. I really want to eeach out to HR about this but I have no idea wht to say. I do not want to lose my job, i want to work a regular 5x8 schedule as I feel I can manage that a lot better but Im not sure how to start. The constant calls have left me in a state of fight or flight it has just become unbereable and im crying writing this post about to take my first call of the day in 10 minutes."
[FL] an open end interview invitation? What does this mean?,"I have sent an application in, so they have my information and it‚Äôs not a surprise that I have been contacted.

If you were unable to attend, please let me know and we can set up an interview time that works for you‚Äù. The message was not personalized to me, nor did it reference any position I had applied to. I know that it wasn‚Äôt a bot because they did respond to questions I had texted back with, but it sounded as if it was somebody who just had my information as a person interested and did not know anything about me or the hiring manager, or the position I was interested in.

[PA] Taking Time Off Between Internal Positions?,"I'm currently a contractor for a big engineering company interviewing for a full-time position. Because of the nature of contract work (no PTO) I've taken exactly 6 days off in the past 12 months excluding federal holidays, and I'm more than a little burnt out. Would it be unreasonable to request a gap between positions if I get the full-time job (I'm feeling confident I will)? I know it's common to give yourself a week or two off between jobs when hopping companies, but I've never heard of that internally and am not entire sure if that would start me out on a bad note.

[CH] HR propose implementing 360 Review in a chaotic start-up: thoughts?,"My company (Swiss based with global remote employees; I'm based in Ireland) is a pretty new scale-up that had doubled in size in the past year from about 30 to just over 60. This year we had our first ever performance review, which was a pretty rushed job but whatever. It was the usual questions and then a discussion with your manager.Yesterday, the whole team got an email that next year they will be instituting 360 performance reviews across the whole team. This immediately raised massive red flags for me. There are so many small internal issues/grievances, combined with managers who are the first time in a management role, plus just general organisation chaos due to the massive growth and a completely remote working environment. They haven't confirmed if the information will be used to inform bonuses but I imagine it will be.I'd like to get some perspective on 360 performance reviews. I just feel instinctively that this is a terrible idea, especially in an organisation with poor psychological safety. I'm at a senior enough level that I can raise it and be listened to but I just want to get a sense check on other people's experiences with this type of review.TLDR: What is your experience/view of 360 reviews in a start-up setting?"

"[NV] Coworker is abusing PTO, don‚Äôt want to snitch so what can I do?","I work at a  large mineral mine, and in my role there I run a piece of machinery with two other coworkers. The crews are very large and we mostly operate outside the normal day to day production that you would expect a mine. The crew that we work with are in a rotating schedule and ours is a Mon - Thurs straight days job. I feel this is someone pertinent to the situation, we don‚Äôt always see our direct supervisor, we more often deal with engineers, geologist and geotechs.So when one of the group has to take time off we have a running group chat to keep in contact with one and other and make sure we have the means to get to work. We have a company truck that we share out of the three, two of live in town that is about 50 miles from work and the other coworker lives in a smaller town that is on the way to work that is about 20 miles in that direction.Here is my issue. My coworkers that lives in the town closer to work is abusing his PTO. We are expected to communicate with the on duty supervisor and advise him of our absence and adjust one‚Äôs own time card thru a program at work. Honor system, more or less. Since we don‚Äôt always see our supervisor he assumes we have reported to work and all is in order. My coworker has, on several occasion not called a supervisor when the time is being taken off, or adjusted his time according. I can‚Äôt personally verify these claims but going off of years of services and that we work 12 hour days, your pto goes quick. He also bragged to our other coworker that he got a whole week off while being paid like he was at work. He has taken no less that four weeks off this year and that‚Äôs at 48 hours a week. That‚Äôs at the very least 192 hours this year. His years of service is under three years and the company gives those people in those years of service 120 hours a year that is accrued every two weeks in increments of 4.5 in his case.My dilema is that he wants wants to take another week off near that end of this year, and I can only assume that he wants to take it off and still get paid. What can I do to bring this to the attention of the proper people with out being a snitch. I‚Äôm posting this on 10/25 and he pull crap yesterday and I made it point to see my supervisors several times thru our my shift to see if they noticed his missing and had no luck. He even asked my coworker our supervisor saw us yesterday while he was absent. I‚Äôm frustrated because he gets away with this nonsense. What can I do to remedy this problem I have with our compromising my coworker or my position at work‚Ä¶we have a sweet gig at work I don‚Äôt want to jeopardize it."

[TX] When do I give notice and how do I ensure a good reference from a boss that will be mad I‚Äôm leaving?,"I work in education as an instructional coach in Texas, and I‚Äôm an ‚Äúat will‚Äù employee that is not under contract. I‚Äôm transitioning to a career in learning and development and just signed an offer to work at a very larger multinational consulting firm. The next step is the background check, which includes a reference check. I‚Äôve been a good employee with no performance issues or disciplinary actions of any kind for my entire tenure (4 years). In general, my direct supervisor, the principal, likes me and praises my work. However, in the past when teachers have left mid-year, she tells us to discourage them, or at least not be supportive, and we have been told explicitly not to write reference letters if they ask. She tells us to remind them that they signed a contract. They did not, as our offer letter each year explicitly states we are ‚Äúat will‚Äù.  I‚Äôm fairly certain she‚Äôs not going to be happy with my decision to leave mid-year.Here‚Äôs my dilemma:The new company did not explicitly ask me to provide references when applying, although they still could in the coming days. Best case scenario,  they use an outside firm that fact checks what‚Äôs on my resume generally through HR in some way. Either way, I don‚Äôt want to give notice before the background check goes through, especially given my principal‚Äôs attitude about this in the past. I also don‚Äôt want to blind side her if they do reach out to her directly for a reference. I‚Äôm afraid she might somehow sabotage it. I know she can‚Äôt say any untruths, but maybe she just won‚Äôt respond, and I‚Äôll risk losing my current job. I assume this is a pretty common scenario. Any advice on how I should deal with it? Is this something I could explain to my recruiter and get their take, or would it come off as a red flag to them in some way? I‚Äôm probably overthinking this but would be devastated to lose this opportunity. I also really love and respect the team I currently work with (despite my bosses shortcomings regarding employees leaving) and don‚Äôt want to burn any bridges.

When I reminded boss of this and said it made me uncomfortable to drive this guy alone given his history my boss said he didn‚Äôt care and to do it.Luckily a male coworker stepped in to give the guy a ride.But I feel like after explicitly stating the situation made me uncomfortable then I shouldn‚Äôt have been told to still do it. I‚Äôm sure boss is going to throw this back in my face at some point.
I feel like my supervisor raises his voice at me when he's upset. Is that appropriate? [NJ],"We meet one to two times a week to discuss updates but I work mostly independently. I am relatively new to this time of position and do not know the expectations without them being communicated to me. I learned a few months after starting that I was somehow missing something (I thought my supervisor was having communication issues but tried to brush it off, but my supervisor thought the same of me). This is related to work that my supervisor started ahead of me getting there, and I do not always have all of the information I need about all of the work that already happened as a result.Several months into the job, I learned about my supervisor's communication preferences because he notified me that he thought we were having communication issues (the fact it was my responsibility was implied). At this same time, I learned about expectations he had for my role for the first time and acted like I should have been aware of these tasks/structures. They are not explicitly stated in my job description. I been trying to adapt but it feels like a guessing game because I am supposed to tell my supervisor what I am doing, only to be told no, that's wrong, do it this (not wrong but specific and preferred) way. When there is a miscommunication about projects, he will sometimes raise his voice. I'm honestly a little afraid of having to talk to him because I have anxiety issues and until we had this conversation, I was otherwise blissfully unaware and otherwise okay with my job.I have a disability and think that could be a possible cause from my end, but I do not feel like this is fully my fault even though I'm open to adjusting my approaches. I was assigned a mentor who basically confirmed that it kind of is a guessing game but he was able to give me advice that helps in my meetings. Two people who were hired earlier than us left very early after starting (this is kind of heresay because I wasn't there yet) but this may have been due to job offers of higher salaries, not necessarily the jobs themselves. My supervisor is older and is an advanced professional, but I am an experienced adult with credentials myself.Is this a red flag? I was really excited about the position at first and have kind of lost motivation as a result. How early would it be to switch jobs in the same institution? I have a union contract, so I am aware it has to comply with that as well - any advice? I think I will stick it out for now and reassess in December. It's good for my career and I do not necessarily need my current position for anything other than a salary (no need for recommendations). I know I can tolerate the job (albeit without enthusiasm) if things don't escalate, but I am worried and want a plan in case it seems to get worse."
[BE] Fire me for situation at home?,"Edit: Thank you all so much for all the replies! As I don‚Äôt have much time right now, I‚Äôll take this space to respond to all the messages. A big thank you for everyone who took the time to read and reply! I have read all of the messages and I take them really seriously. I really understand that my relationship is not healthy at this point and that I need to find a solution. I keep hoping on change tho, and in the meantime I try to figure out how ‚Äòsecure‚Äô my job is when it‚Äôs known that my situation at home is difficult. Because sometimes I feel like I want to explain but I just can‚Äôt. If I would let HR know (at least the confidant, she works in HR team), would this be seen as a red flag, a possible (big) risk for the company and therefore better to ‚Äòget rid of me‚Äô? I am trying to figure that out before I say something which I shouldn‚Äôt have. So I am gathering a lot of information about this and all the replies have been helpful. I‚Äôll probably read them again tomorrow because a lot of useful things have been said!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîI am really struggling with what would be the best thing to do at the moment. Posting from a throwaway account, as I obviously don‚Äôt want to use my normal account for this post.I have a really nice job where I have earned my position and all the respect from my colleagues. I am not really visible for my colleagues but my work definitely is. I perform beyond expectations and I also get complimented a lot. My job is not the easiest but I managed to get everything under control and keep things rolling. It‚Äôs an operational job so I can work from home and I fortunately don‚Äôt have a lot of meetings. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not really visible, only for my own team.The thing is, at home I have a lot of struggles. I keep work and private separate at all costs because I don‚Äôt want anyone to know what kind of troubles I sometimes have, especially in my relationship. My boyfriend actually doesn‚Äôt want me to work but he allows it. Lately he is really stressed and gets angry for the smallest things. Today he got incredibly mad because I was comforting a colleague through a call, she was stressed and I wanted to help her, which made my boyfriend mad, saying it wasn‚Äôt my job to comfort people and that I should not talk to anyone. No more calls. It‚Äôs really hard because he can be so unpredictable, sometimes he is really proud of how I do my job, and sometimes he hates that I have a job and wants me to quit. Right now it feels like a prison at home. I have some excuses in line to be able to skip the upcoming calls, I could get away with missing 2‚Ä¶ 3 would be suspicious I guess but maybe by that time my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt bother anymore or isn‚Äôt even at home.No one in my company knows about my situation at home and I really want it to stay that way. Only one person from HR knows a little bit about it and she said I could always talk to her about it. However I am really scared to lose my job if I would tell how the situation at this moment is. They could see it as a risk and fire me, even tho I perform near perfectly.So my question is; is it a true possibility to get fired over this? What should I do? I feel a little bit lost at this moment because I don‚Äôt want to lose my job and I also don‚Äôt want to appear as a weak person.EDIT: Adding to this; I know my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt sound like the nicest guy right now but he is absolutely not always like this. Only just now he really sucks but I really love him and I also really don‚Äôt want to lose him!"
Background check delay Indiana [IN],I accepted a position with a company for $105k in the finance dept. I submitted all my info to Accurate (the company they are using) for the background check and it is taking 3 weeks!  First they found someone with my name in GA with a criminal record and I proved it isn‚Äôt me.  Now they are waiting for the state I live in (Indiana)to return the criminal data. Is this company doing something other companies haven‚Äôt?  I have made this much before with no issues and have passed all background checks and this is holding up my start date and pushed out my benefits until the first of the year so it has become a big problem. Is there any way to make this go faster?  I have completed 3 background checks in the last 2 years with zero issue. What is the deal??

[TX] Meal/Break Related/Ongoing HR issues,"There are so many issues at my current workplace.  I have a question about the wording of a direction.We got the following ""Directive""...""During business hours all routine questions or issues related to an employee's specific needs should be done prior/after the scheduled work day or during their lunch or break.""For myself; the sentence is instructing employees to talk to HR PRIOR to working... AFTER working... DURING their LUNCH... Or DURING their BREAK.I have been in talks with this company's corporate ethics since July about the things going on in the facility.  I sent that to the person who has been ""conducting the investigation."". This person is aware that my complaints are lodged at HR and AP management/policies.This was the response I got from the Director of HR:""I would encourage you to speak with (Manager) and/or HR for clarification concerning when employees are compensated for the time in HR.""The issue isn't compensation... The issue is giving direction to do something on lunch or break.They also added they will finally be bringing my investigation to a close in two days from now.  The ""unnamed manager"" is one of the ones that I have a direct conflict with and the HR manager was also involved in the initial complaint."

[NJ] My bf works for Terminix in NJ and they didn‚Äôt pay him for all the hours he was clocked in for,One day his work truck broke down.  We had to drive pretty far away to find a shop that they had a contract with that could take it that day.  He made his manager aware of what was happening and he clocked in that day even though he couldn‚Äôt go to stops because it wasn‚Äôt his fault and he was dealing with getting their truck fixed.  His manager didn‚Äôt say anything to him but changed his hours and didn‚Äôt pay him for that day.  He went to his manager‚Äôs manager who said you should have come to me beforehand‚Ä¶ not sure how he could have known his manager was going to change his hours.. is what they did ok?  It seems so wrong to me but I‚Äôve been salaried my whole life so I don‚Äôt totally get how it works.  He‚Äôs a full time employee with benefits but is paid hourly.

[CA] Sterling check,"[CA] Sterling CheckI was evicted in 2020 in USA because of Covid I could not keep up with payments. Eventually, I moved to my home country (Srilanka) and started a job here they have requested Sterling background check. Now I will be working in Srilanka and not in the USA. Now my question is can I mention in my BGV form about my US details such as SSN etc or will it have negative impact? because if I mention SSN it could mention my previous address and definitely older landlord will not have good things to say about me. Or can I skip US part as I do not live there nor will I be working from US? Also I have masters from US (should I mention that?) or should I keep my bachelors as my highest qualification which I received from Srilanka"

[NY] Just signed a job offer letter! Questions of NYC background checks for new employees,"Hi everyone. I recently accepted a new job offer that will almost double my existing salary. I'm super excited and optimistic for me and my family's future.That said, the contract states that the offer is conditional upon references (not worried), signing an NDA (sure) and a background check. The last one I'm worried about. My job history and education are all accurate or as close to accurate as it can be. No criminal records, lawsuits, tax related issues or anything of that sort. I am however sitting on a lot of debt and unpaid bills over the last few months due to unforeseen expenses over 2022. My credit dipped significantly. But I read that NYC has made it illegal for employers to discriminate upon credit scores, and they might not even be allowed to check. Is this true? Are there workarounds for them to still check your score and disqualify you for some other random reason?To confirm, my job is not related to city/federal govt, I am not in charge of company finances/equities, and the employer is a growing startup (maybe they're more relaxed?). I will be working in IT. The background check will be through Sterling, which I understand is more geared towards employment verification, but can they also run credit checks?I'm 95% sure my offer letter wont be revoked despite my credit and I'm certain it won't be checked and/or used to discriminate but I just wanted to be absolutely sure. Otherwise it would really suck for me to lose a job opportunity and chance to no longer be poor due to currently being poor lol."
[CAN] Caught my employee in a lie about a fake medical issue. Now what?,"Basically title. An employee had a scheduled time off for a medical appointment and when we were in team status they said they were getting ""procedure x"" done. Only thing is I have had procedure x done last year and I know it requires anesthesia, they would need additonal time off than the 2 hour gap they requested, and there's a lot of information they weren't aware of about what they were supposedly having done that day.I'm not really sure if any HR pros have seen something like this happen before? I've fired an employee for performance issues which was straight forward enough. But never someone who's bold faced lied about a medical thing.I don't even care if they're going for a job interview and making an excuse but when if their reason for being offline is an obvious lie about a medical condition that gets caught (and other team members were on the call when they were caught) I can't not do anything. And I don't if it's okay grounds for firing?"
[PL] When to better negotiate your salary?,"Hi community!I have applied for a position in an important company in the internet and telecommunications field.In July I have had the first talk with the HR in which they asked for the salary range. I have asked exactly what I wanted and now I realise how naive I was! If I start with what I want how can I effectively negotiate afterwords? Should have definitely set the bar a bit higher.Fast forward to today, when I had the last round of interview (yes, it takes ages, I know...).The situation in my country has changed quite a bit, with an inflation rate of 17 % and as of now, I wouldn't be satisfied if I received exactly what I asked for in July.In the meantime, I completed a course on Tableau and enrolled in an after study course provided by the uni of economics in my city, which will give me a background of project management, excel advanced and Power Bi. So I'm also in a good position to negotiate an eventual offer.I feel like I should acquire some space, some margin to negotiate effectively, but when to do so? My doubt is: should I contact HR asking to, slightly, modify the salary range I ask for, or should I wait for the actual offer to finally negotiate?"
[UPDATE] [MD] For: Am I overreacting about being touched by a coworker?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/yacsc6/md_am_i_overreacting_about_being_touched_by_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_buttonThis is an update to a post I did a few days ago about being touched by a coworker. After my talk on Friday with my manager, I sent her an email as documentation about our talk as suggested by a few of you guys. I went into work yesterday and nothing was said to me by my manager about the situation. So I took it upon myself to ask when we'd have a discussion. I asked her if she had even talked to the coworker the first time she touched me, and she said she did not feel it would be a problem after the first touch, so she didn't. I was confused because something should have been said after the first touch. She then explained she was afraid to bring it up this time to the coworker before she left, in fear of the cowokers' retaliation against me. I told her I would be fine and it had to be done.All three of us talked, and the coworker cut me off as I was trying to explain. She would not let me talk, and I had to say ""excuse me, I was speaking"" several times. She tried to throw in details about another situation that occurred. However, they have no relevance to one another. She could not explain to me why she touched me again. I made it very clear I was uncomfortable. I told her that our manager saw the second touch and her eyes got wide. When the conversation was done and she left back to work, my manager said that the co-worker still did not take me seriously and said to call her if things went south that night.When I got home, I sent an email to HR, and I am waiting to hear back from them right now. I feel as though nothing good will come from this. My manager weirdly put me on the schedule for 36 hours this week when I usually work 22‚Äì25 hours. But I now know it was for good reason. Even so, I have my resignation letter ready in the drafts. I thought I'd tell everyone that I'm a pharmacy tech in training and that the person harassing me is one of the pharmacists. Maybe that's why they won't do anything because we are short-staffed and they need people. Either way, it's wrong and unacceptable. I'm not sure if I'll update anymore. But most likely, I'll have to find another job after this. ¬†Also, thank you to everyone who helped me out last week I really appreciate it."

[CA]Got job offer letter but manager is being vague about my start date. Should I move on?,"I have been using this gig app working gigs around. I worked one time at this place and the manager liked me and asked me if I would like to work for them. I accepted but I was gonna be away out of state for a week and half and manager was okay with it. She told me she needed 2 more employees and already hired one.I filled the app. When I was out of state she texted me when I can start. Now this is the complicated scenario, the gig app I am using booked me until the end of October to work there but different facility. The manager was okay with it, she told me to just finish my assignments and start after.I returned back, I was emailed a background check and I passed it. When I went to work there a few days ago, through the app, they had hired a new employee with lots of experience unlike me who is still learning.Today I went over and asked the manager when am I gonna be given my I-9. She was quite vague saying how I need to finish my assignments first and then I will be called and fill it here in person. I asked an employee who was recently hired by the same agency and she told me they immediately sent her the I-9 through email and got on board. So I kinda jumped to the conclusion that the manager has been lying to me.I feel like I've wasted a lot of time, is there anything I could do? Like possible get employment with the same company but at another venue? It feels like they prefer using a temp employee 3 days a week vs. full time and not having to pay union or health insurance, etc. It also seems the manager tried to offer to other temps to work there, like why would she do that?"

[TX] Blindsided by unexpected criticism,"I‚Äôm almost two years into a job that I love working for a boss I enjoyed. I have received only positive feedback from him, including interviewing and getting hired twice (first contract, then staff) and two annual reviews, the last with a merit increase. I‚Äôve sensed a change very recently. At first I thought it was pressure from his boss to increase our productivity, but now unexpectedly my boss is directing his stress/frustration toward me. I tried to meet with him two weeks ago to discuss but he canceled at the last minute.I finally got him to meet with me last week as he was preparing to travel for a week. I said I wanted to understand why things had changed, and he became angry and accusatory, saying I was not being a ‚Äúself-starter‚Äù and not moving projects forward. At least a dozen of these projects are waiting for his approval to start development. A few others I have been assigned are outside of my primary skill set and job description, but I‚Äôve done my best with them. I explained that I had never received any guidance from him prioritizing projects while he stubbornly insisted we ‚Äútalked about it all the time‚Äù when I knew he hadn‚Äôt - leaving me feeling gaslighted. He left me with a list of three projects to show progress on by the time he returns on Friday and I‚Äôm making progress on all three.I‚Äôm terrified he‚Äôs setting me up for termination for poor job performance, but until last week he had never indicated any issues. This change has been abrupt and very unsettling and I‚Äôm in a panic about how to proceed. How do I de-escalate this conflict and return to our previous ‚Äúnormal‚Äù with a good working relationship and positive feedback? I feel we need a neutral arbitrator to help reset expectations on both sides, but I‚Äôm afraid bringing this to HR will only inflame things further. I‚Äôm utterly lost about how to work toward resolving the conflict without making things worse and hastening my termination. How do I proceed?"
"[CO] I have the unique opportunity to basically create my dream job at current employer, but unsure what an appropriate title & salary would be.","A little background before going into my main question. I‚Äôve been at my current job about 4 years as a consultant/auditor. My pay caps out at about 150k when factoring in bonuses and other benefits. When I joined the team, we were about 12 people and had virtually no processes, quality control, efficiencies or automation for our work. Over the course of the past 2 years or so, I‚Äôve spent personal time building some tools that are now used by most people on the team. We‚Äôve since grown, going through 2 acquisitions, and now we are a division within a 400+ employee firm. Our division is split into 3 main teams totaling over 60 people.I was recently offered the opportunity to create a new job within the company to continue improving processes, implementing efficiencies, build our department knowledge tools/library, and continue building automation of workflows for all 3 teams in our division (previously only did this for one team on my own time). We currently net about $8MM/yr in revenue, with growth expected to take us over $15MM next year.I am not sure what type of job description would best encompass all of these tasks, nor what ‚Äúlevel‚Äù would be appropriate. I was thinking something along the lines of ‚ÄúDirector of Knowledge management and process improvement‚Äù or something to that effect. Given our net revenues and the magnitude of the job, as well as my current pay, would a salary ask of $200-220k be too high? Or should I ask for more?Thank you!"

Address Mgr Issues in Skip-Level? [IL],"I have a skip-level meeting with my HR Director (boss' boss) soon and don't know if I should bring up the issues I've had with my boss. I would appreciate any advice on how to bring this up or if I should keep it to myself for now.I am a mid-level HR Generalist and have been in HR 10 years. About 6 months ago I started a new job under a manager who has worked in HR almost 1 year now. Her background is in Recruiting.The issues are:Boss is adamant I start all one on ones with employees by reassuring them it is 100% confidential. This is 100% not true. On top of not enjoying lying to employees, I feel they lose confidence when they think I can't or won't escalate Ops issues in the interest of not breaking confidentiality. (I tried to explain my perspective but my boss just responded with ""So you're refusing to do it?"")Boss is adamant I do not take notes in one-on-one meetings with employees because she would feel weird as an employee if HR were to take notes. (EEs regularly thank me for documenting details of our meetings so I explained the thanks and kudos I've received to my boss. She just said it is too uncomfortable for me to take notes and to stop)Boss will give me explicit instructions (eg. don't send this in Teams; CC the Department) and will then call me out for not doing the opposite of what she said. It's so petty.Just infinite pettinessBoss will ask for a lot of detail immediately upon us BOTH learning of a situation and will rapid-fire questions at me even if she is aware I am finding information out at the exact same time as her (example below if you want detail).TLDR: I have a skip-level meeting with my director (boss' boss) soon and am hesitant to bring up any of the issues I've had with my boss. What direction does this sub think I should take?Example: Within seconds of seeing an employee had been out and asking my boss if she'd heard anything, she asked the below questions in rapid succession. When I didn't know the answers off the top of my head she asked me ""Well what do you know?"" which I found to be unbelievably rude. Also some of the questions she asked, there's no way I could know the answer without checking the HRIS."

[CA] Was I strung along by a prospective employer for eight months? Is this normal HR hiring work?,"In February, I applied for a top manager position at a think tank which is very well-respected and well-known in my industry. I did not meet the experience qualifications, but I work in an adjacent space to the think-tank and felt I do much of the responsibilities listed for the position already.Over the next month, I had two interviews; in the latter I was told by the HR person I was just too inexperienced compared to other candidates. I understood and moved on.In May, I was reached out by the same HR person for a position directly under the exec position. HR person said I would be a top candidate. I ""applied"" (I just emailed the same resume, as instructed by HR person) and had two more interviews for the position. Then I received radio silence the entire summer. I thought I was rejected.In August, the HR person reaches back out to say the position has been rebranded and modified, and if interested, I am still the top candidate. In fact, HR person and I start discussing salary ranges in our first interview for this position (that's 5 interviews now). HR person even connected me with a subordinate in the company (if given this position, I would be her boss) to assist her project, to which I was very familiar about through my current work.I had an interview last month (6th one total), which I thought went pretty well. After a month of no contact, I received an email on Sunday night saying they are moving forward with different candidates. HR person thanked me for my patience and encouraged me to apply again.My partner who has been privy to all this exploded last night at what she claimed is huge unprofessionalism by the HR person and this think tank. She claims what has happened in on par with getting strung along and said to never apply to this place ever again. Perhaps I'm just worn out by the long-drawn process, but I couldn't bring myself to be so angry.  I'm asking for some clarity on whether this kind of behavior is normal (or abnormal) and if there are any learning lessons from this."
[NC] Working in PA but company HQed out of NC,"[NC] Working in PA but company HQed out of NCSo back in 2017 and 2018 I worked in the state of Pennsylvania. My company was headquartered out of NC. On my W2 for 17 and 18 my employers name and address is the NC address. MY address is a PA address and I worked in an office in PA. My state taxes were sent to the state of PA as evidenced by the ""PA state filing"" being recorded for my ""copy 2 to be filed with employees state income tax"" shown on both W2s. Box 15 is showing PA as well. I had my taxes done by HR block in 2017.The state of NC Dept of Revenue is now asking me to pay state taxes for 2017 and 18 even though I filed and paid state taxes in PA.Am I required to file additional state taxes or forms with the state of NC?"
Withholding my application? [CA],"Hello,I am working at a legal non-profit in SF, [CA]. I had been working there as a legal interviewer since Feb 2022. Recently, an old co-worker from my immigration law non-profit sent me a posting for a coordinator position in my same company and even same department (just a different team). It essentially was a job that I was highly qualified for and something that I would throughly enjoy doing. I spoke with my supervisors and they encouraged me to apply. I then sent my resume and cover letter to HR in October 2022.HR had responded after a bit and had asked if she could call me and speak with me without a lot of details. We spoke and she essentially stated that I couldn't apply since I had not been at the company for at least a year. She then proceeded to ask me if I disliked the position that I was in currently, I rejected the idea as it wasn't true. She then said just so you know the pay is lateral and I assured her that I did not mind. I expressed that I was sent the position from a co-worker from the same field as the position and she was surprised as she thought I was looking to move on my own. She stated that she just wanted to be consistent and kept emphasizing the pay. I expressed that it was a shame that I couldn't apply, since I had worked with the team before and I knew them from my position.I was just wondering if this was appropriate and if I would be able to talk with her about the process. When I spoke to my supervisors of the situation they were also confused as it is the same department and stated that they should have at least allowed me to apply. Please let me know what I could do. Thank you!"
"[VA] Is it really so bad to give notice to your boss by email (ie, no call beforehand)?","I want to do the respectful thing but 1) I'm a virtual employee and I have almost no relationship with my boss and 2) I'm autistic and not a great conversationalist in any circumstance, and definitely not when delivering bad news. So, dear AskHR community, I'm wondering how ""bad"" it is to send my boss a gracious email declaring my intent to leave without calling her beforehand. Can I get away with this or am I throwing away my chance at a future reference? I could offer in the body of the email (with my formal resignation letter attached) to discuss my decision further over a call. What do you think?"
[PA] Approached by recruiter but hes ghosting?,"hello! Im bit confused and ill appreciate any help on this In short, ive been added by recruiter on Linkedin, after asking him reason politely he said thats because my portfolio was handed to him and they are looking for people with experience like mine. Didnt asked anything except if i was okay with moving in another state and that was it basically. Is it normal/expected? Im also interested in this company so should i also send cv to their job posting mail? Thanks!"
[PA] Insubordination? Are there grounds for termination?,"I worked in a call center for a Fortune 500 company from June 2016 to April 2022. Suffice to say, after nearly 6 years, my patience had run its course and I was yearning for a change in roles that would take me off the phones and allow me to work at a more comfortable, less stressful pace. In April, I transitioned into a more ""behind the scenes"" role with the company and have been quite happy in this new role and can see it as a path for advancement to bigger and better things moving forward.The problem, however, is that our call center has been struggling with heightened volumes for the better part of the past year or more and our call center management team has resorted to pulling back people who previously worked in the call center to provide temporary help. In the 6 months I've been in my new role, I have been ""volun-told"" to return to the call center on 3 separate occasions. The first time was for one week, the second time was to help with a busy Monday, and just the other day I was informed it will be over the course of the next two weeks for a total of four days. There's a good chance there will be more to come until the call center hires more people.The way that the request is being brought to us doesn't really give us the option to say no, hence the use of ""volun-told"" to describe the situation. It's usually presented by my manager as, ""Unfortunately, call center leadership let me know the call center has been struggling with volumes and they're gonna need you guys to help them out for [period of time].""I've previously had discussions with my new manager about my thoughts on the matter and I feel somewhat guilty because the impression I've received is that my manager is basically just passing the message from call center management to those of us being asked to help. He sounds like he really doesn't want to have to deliver this news and that it pains him to have to break it to us. The response my manager has given each time I've mentioned how I feel about it is basically, ""I hear you. Hopefully, this is the last time.""I've explained to my manager that one of the reasons for wanting to move into this new role is that I believe it better suits my skillset and I feel as though I can do better work in a significantly less stressful environment. While working in the call center (especially early/mid- and post-pandemic), my mental health took a nosedive and I was constantly stressed out and anxious. You always got a ""We care about you and appreciate everything you're doing....but work faster"" type of feeling from call center leadership.I should also mention that I work for a company that encourages advancement and does not believe in holding people back from moving on. The call center is kind of like the entry-level golden ticket that allows you to do so. When I left the call center in April, I did feel a little bad because I was part of a somewhat large exodus of people who had posted out in order to move on to other jobs while the call center was still struggling. My call center manager knew that I was growing weary of my job there and that I had the desire to move on, so he was thrilled for me once this new job came along and made it clear that there were no hard feelings, despite how busy the call center was. It was always a message like, ""This is our problem. Don't let it stop you from moving on. You don't owe us anything.""The issue that I have is that the job description in my new role mentions nothing about providing call center phone support as needed. My department provides written correspondence for requests that the call center cannot provide verbally to callers at point of call, so there is still a connection to the call center in the sense that these requests are submitted by the call center to my department. However, now that I've transitioned into my new role and am no longer working in the call center, I don't believe it's my problem that they may be struggling to keep up with the volume of calls. I hate to be that person because it's in my nature to be helpful and I have a hard time saying no, but I don't think I'll ever truly be able to get my point across unless I put my foot down and refuse a request like this the next time this comes up. I know that the call center is just doing this with me and my colleagues because we only recently left that area and have retained a usable base of knowledge. They are not asking those who have been out of the call center for a while (but previously worked there) to help out in the same way.I have a scheduled meeting with my new manager next month, in which I was planning to address this again. My question is, if another ""volun-tolding"" comes up in the future, am I within my right as a non-call center employee at this point to refuse the request, or could this be interpreted as insubordination and a reason for my employment to be terminated?"
[AE] Am I getting hired?,"Am I getting hired?So, I‚Äôve been trough series of Interviews. All of the rejections I got would be delivered to me right away after the interview. Then came this one big opportunity I‚Äôve been preparing for‚Ä¶ I really want to work with this company as it I believe my skillset would be beneficial for them, also there‚Äôs career growth in there‚Ä¶ So the Initial Video Call was done, I did well (I guess, despite being nervous the whole time.) Before we ended the Interview, The HR didn‚Äôt say if I am considered instead she just explained what‚Äôs the next step supposedly should I get hired. (this confuses me, as there‚Äôs no actual telling if I will proceed to the next step, she just simply explained the hiring steps.)It bugged me a lot, what‚Äôs worse is when I sent a Thank You email, the HR replied: Verbatim :Hi NAME,My pleasure. Thank you again for your time and sharing. I will be back in touch in the coming days with next steps.SO, My question is: Am I getting hired? Please help.

[CAN-ON] Recruiter didn't answer after leaving voicemail?,"I got a call from a job recruiter on Saturday however i wasn't able to answer it, they left a voicemail and said to call back.

[VA] Question about a statement from a former employer,"I have a question about obtaining a statement from a former employer. I am currently in the review process to be licensed for what I do in a different state, and as a part of that process I had to state that I was fired from my previous position. That in itself is not a problem for licensure, but it has triggered further investigation.The licensure board is now requiring that a statement be sent directly to them from my former employer. I'm concerned about this because my former supervisor and I did not part on good terms. I only held the job for two months or so, so I was still within the probationary period for new employees and didn't have access to any conflict resolution options within HR. To be clear, I never broke any laws or company policies - this was an issue of fit and personality conflict.How do I go about requesting this statement? I don't know what kind of language to use. Even if I go through HR and leave my former supervisor out of it completely, I'm concerned that they will say something that will get my licensure denied.Thank you for any help or guidance you can provide!"

[MS] Peer to Manager Advice,"What kinds of things should I consider as I move from team lead/peer to a manager position? This is my first time in a leadership role, but I must say I am passionate about the work and organization and eager to learn how to be a good leader.I have 8 individual contributor direct reports (hate that term, but using it for clarity) and work directly under the department head. I‚Äôm closer to some team members than others, but I‚Äôm having trouble with social boundaries. First piece of advice I have tried to follow is avoiding workplace gossip. To be honest, it has been difficult. I want to be better and do better, so I try to listen or deescalate rather than engage. My gut is to step away from friendly banter and going out to lunch with select members because I want to be fair. This also feels disingenuous to the relationships I‚Äôve built.I‚Äôve got a list of leadership books and podcasts, but I want to know what these resources aren‚Äôt telling me- real life examples and how I can make sure I‚Äôm not screwing things up with HR.I have a lot of room to grow at this company with 400ish employees. Im meeting the CEO this week for an informal chat and want to start off on the right foot. We have the same less common educational background."
[NL] What do recruiters think of candidates who ‚Äújump‚Äù often?,"In January I started a CDD risk position at a start up, but despite being praised for performing well, I was laid off three months later (early April) as the company was going through losses. I was hired at another company, a bank, in June for the same position. I was hired through an agency, which then got me a placement at my company. This means that I (1) get paid less than market standard since the agency takes a cut, and (2) there‚Äôs no real job security since I‚Äôm not hired by the bank and I can just be terminated for any reason. The bank offers permanent contracts only after 1.5 years. In the job interview, they gave the impression that it will take less time. Im just about to enter my 5th month with the new company. Because of these reasons, I‚Äôm thinking of starting to look around for other job openings.All that said, what do recruiters think of candidates who have spent only a short amount of time in two previous companies? Will it give a bad impression?"
[CA] Job searching/applying after quitting first job,"Hi All long story short I use to work at Tiffany & Co.

[CA] Offered an incredible new job and am wondering if I should resubmit my Background Check over some very minor details!,"I was offered an incredible new job that I am absolutely excited to begin. I don't know if I'm unreasonably worrying about my background check I submitted and wanted to see if I should ask to resubmit it.I had three slots for my previous employment. I put my current job, my previous one, and a job I had 4 jobs ago (partly because I think they will be easier to get a hold of and be quick). Should I ask to just put the last three jobs I had instead of the last one that I put? Does it matter?Additionally, on my references I put down a reference as a ""Manager"" when he in fact was a ""co-manager"". We both had the title of ""Manager of ___ Dept"". Should I reach out to HR to let them know that they were a co-manager, on the other hand should I just request to change it with the person who was both our actual manager? Both would give glowing reviews.Am I splitting hairs over these minor details?? Everything as far as employment dates, education, and criminal + driving record will come back 100% fine but I feel overly worried over these minor details. Job is in CA but company is an international brand"
[OH] FMLA paperwork?,"So, I dislocated my knee (outside of work) on oct 11 and it‚Äôs caused me to miss a lot of work since I‚Äôm barely able to walk/ on crutches. I went to the ER when it happened and was referred to an orthopedist who then ordered me an MRI on Oct 28th and wrote me a work note with a bunch of restrictions and that I should be off work 10-14 days or until my MRI results come back. Also said I most likely would need surgery considering this same knee has dislocated in the past.My employer checked to see if I was eligible for FMLA, which I was, so they asked me a few questions and wrote everything down, and then told me I would get paper work in the mail and if I didn‚Äôt receive it within a week that I would have to call the FMLA phone number they gave me. Is this accurate? I‚Äôm assuming the paperwork being sent is what I give to my doctor to fill out? They have been kind of unclear with this and honestly I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding it all."

[NY] FSA claims denied/recent addition of dependent.,"Hey HR folk,I elected to have an FSA as of last year 2021, to begin for this year. It began 1/1/2022 and was originally until 12/31/2022. I recently added a dependent to my insurance since she‚Äôs having my baby soon and in between jobs and won‚Äôt be covered under her health insurance until 2 months into her new position (America). Recently, I‚Äôve been finding my FSA card being denied at the cash register. Also, yes, they are FSA eligible items. In addition, my claims or requests for reimbursement with receipt are being rejected because I am ‚Äúno longer part of the plan‚Äù. I checked and found that since my dependent was accepted onto my medical insurance, my FSA was stopped at that same time and I now have a ranging date of 1/1/022-9/11/2022.I am beyond confused about why this is but now I have a $711 bill that I wasn‚Äôt expecting to pay OOP for and I‚Äôm a bit upset about forfeiting $1736.98 to my employer unnecessarily. I have emailed HR about this but they are slow to respond and I‚Äôm having a mini freak out hourly. Is this something that I have messed up? Or is there an issue on HR‚Äôs end?"
[PA] Employer refusing to issue pay raise in accordance with union contract. HR and Union are both dragging feet. Next steps?,"I currently work for an employer in PA and am a member of the local union there. Per our union contract, I was owed an unconditional pay raise more than two months ago and I am owed yet another in just four months. I brought this to the attention of management and was told that HR would be contacted. Waited several weeks before revisiting the subject and was told HR has been uncommunicative about it. So, I approached my local union representative and was told that they would be investigating the issue ‚Äî that was two weeks ago with no follow-up.At this juncture, it appears neither my employer nor the union I am paying weekly dues to are interested in upholding this contract.There doesn't appear to be any way to go around my local HR rep and the same can be said about my local union rep.Any advice for what my next steps would be?"
[AU] Taking on more direct reports - should I ask to review my pay?,"I‚Äôve been in my current role for under a year. In that time, I‚Äôve grown my team of direct reports from 3 to 6, while also taking on a ‚Äú2IC‚Äù role to my boss, who is on the Executive Team. From the feedback I‚Äôm getting, I‚Äôm doing well in this role. My boss fought for me to get a pay rise during the annual pay review cycle, even though the policy says I hadn‚Äôt worked at the company long enough to be eligible for this round. I‚Äôm very grateful to have this kind of support from my boss.One of my peers is possibly on their way out the company, and my boss has indicated he would like me to take over their 3 direct reports. That‚Äôs takes my team size to 9, so my team of reports will have tripled since starting less than a year ago (and this is my first true people leader role). In addition to that, the team I would be absorbing have a different specialty so I would be assuming accountability for a whole different set of projects / outcomes.Should I ask to discuss pay / benefits if this becomes formal? How do you quantify the change in responsibility as a $$ / % figure to understand what kind of ballpark this would be?"
"I work for a small company of mid 20 people desk jobs, led by ONE boss for all employees. How do we get a HR person?

[GER] New colleague quite picky with tasks,"A new colleague was hired to take over a role that I was covering temporarily since another colleague left our organization early this year.  This new colleague moved to our city as a refugee. Our company serve clients worldwide. As we were going through the tasks I assigned to her on that day, she told me that she doesn‚Äôt want to handle a particular client because they are from the country that they are at war with. Before I assigned this particular client to her, it also crossed my mind but I know the client well as I‚Äôve spoken to them previously. I told her they‚Äôre really easy to work with, but I‚Äôll take the client back. And then she told me that the name of the main contact person in that company is actually a name of a person from her country and she‚Äôs certain that this contact is from her country. I didn‚Äôt comment on it anymore. I completely understand her situation but how am I supposed to completely move on to my other role if there are clients that she doesn‚Äôt want to handle due to personal reasons. I didn‚Äôt even want to tell her that it‚Äôs work and we don‚Äôt really get to choose. I heard all her stories and what she went through leaving her country and it‚Äôs really tough.

"[UK] Lowballed myself in HR conversation, how do I recover?","A bit of context: I've been approached by a recruiter to apply for a role similar to the one I'm in now at a different company. During our initial call the recruiter asked me what salary I'd be looking for and I named a salary which is approx. 10% over what I'm making at the moment (worth noting my current company pays below market level). The job ad includes a ‚Äúsalary band‚Äù but it‚Äôs not explicit (e.g. band 6) so it‚Äôs not very helpful. I've been invited to interview officially and only now (sadly) decided to look up the average salary for the role on Glassdoor. It seems the starting band for this role at this company is, on average, about 10k over what I asked for. So I suppose I‚Äôm wondering two things:If they have a set salary band for this role and Glassdoor is roughly accurate, could they pay me under said salary band because I asked for less?How do I recover from this? Should I:speak to the recruiter ahead of the interview and mention I've done more research and realised I'm undervaluing myself and ask them to confirm what the salary band is? (note they are internal talent acquisition so don‚Äôt think they get commission from this) orwait for an offer first if the interview is positive and negotiate at that pointI'm finding it difficult to decide on next steps so any advice is welcome. Thanks!"
[IN] How to handle a coworker that actively causes massive issues with work?,"Somewhat throwaway account. It‚Äôs whatever my phone made lmaoI work in an office environment. I‚Äôm going to be intentionally vague, but basically, we do numbers and computer stuff and interact with the IRS a lot. Needless to say we have to be accurate with our stuff. If we aren‚Äôt, we get tagged with a fine from them. I take pride in my work ethic and work extremely hard to be efficient and effective at what I do.About six months ago a new employee was hired to take half the load of the section of work that I‚Äôm in. This was greatly appreciated as I was overwhelmed due to short staffing at the time and was taking on the workload of multiple people. I was optimistic and glad to finally have someone to help me‚Ä¶ except they‚Äôve done nothing but make my job and work environment worse.They don‚Äôt understand how to use vital programs on a computer for our job (which is a requirement for this job actually), and because of this consistently deletes formulas, references, and other data that I or another worker has to go back, find, and repair. They never understand why things aren‚Äôt working out and gets defensive if errors are pointed out. I‚Äôve tried hard to watch and go back over their work when they finish, but without the physical documents we compare it to, there‚Äôs only so much I can spot. Our company has been fined multiple times over mistakes that have been made by them that I couldn‚Äôt catch. This never happened before and it‚Äôs got me stressed tf out.At first I didn‚Äôt mind having to go in and correct things for a new person. They‚Äôre new, it‚Äôs part of the learning process. But it is the same thing every day. For six months. They never remember how to do our job and expects someone to stop their work and come over to guide them through it step by step every day. And it‚Äôs never a simple ‚Äúdo this‚Äù answer. We have to physically point to the screen to get them to understand they have to click somewhere. I have expressed my frustration multiple times to the supervisor because I cannot fathom why we are keeping someone who actively cannot to this job despite having it for six months, and the only solution made was to push most of that work back onto the rest of us.It is to the point now where they have interfered with my work enough that I genuinely want to quit. I love this job but now I dread coming in on the days we work together because it means that in addition to my own workload, I have to worry about theirs as well. Every pause I get I go in to make sure things aren‚Äôt messed up so that we aren‚Äôt here all night trying to figure out what they did. On the days they‚Äôre off, I‚Äôm having to correct things from the past week. I‚Äôve worked a lot of really shitty jobs, and this is the first I genuinely felt I was appreciated at.. but now I‚Äôm being paid the same rate as someone with zero problem solving skills and a knack for screwing things up. If their work is worth just the same as the rest of us, then why are we all trying hard not to make mistakes and get fined, you know? I can just not do anything correctly and still keep my job, it seems. But that really bothers me.Anyway, am I wrong to be upset? I certainly don‚Äôt want to leave, but I can‚Äôt take working with this person anymore. I don‚Äôt want to fix mistakes to previously-completed days weeks later because they went back and changed things without telling anyone and left it all wrong and a mess. The lack of response from management makes me think I‚Äôm overreacting, even though they‚Äôve scolded us about the fines multiple times.I‚Äôm obviously not getting direction from my superiors. Do I just need to nut up and shut up? Accept that this is my job now and there isn‚Äôt anything I can do about it?"

Due to an extreme downturn in that sector's profitability and a desire to relocate, I have been applying for jobs over the past few months (often through indeed.com or the companies/institutions website) - to no avail.Sometimes, I will call or email the listed contact person, have a nice conversation where they seem eager to take the next steps in the hiring process. I have a graduate degree in the hard sciences, research background and nearly a decade of consulting work and business ownership in horticulture, agriculture and arboriculture, so I focus on that and don't mention cannabis. These are jobs working for things like land grant university extension services, arborist companies, etc... After sending my resume though, I never hear from them again.Recently I have removed all mentions of cannabis from my resume, but the first thing that comes up when searching for my name and the name of consulting business is newspaper articles about cannabis businesses I have been involved with.What should I do? Should I completely forget about relocating anyplace where cannabis is not legal?"
[PA] Contacting current employees after getting an offer?,"Hi HR people. I work at a small design agency in a large city in PA. I was recently offered a new position at a global agency based in the UK with East Coast offices. It's a great offer and is providing things my current role doesn't: industry-standard wages, strong management, room for growth.While researching my interviewers during the interview process, I realized that the employee who had been in my position before I joined the team (aka the reason there was an opening and I got my current job) now works at this same global agency. They quit my current agency to join that team and now I would essentially be doing the same thing.My question is: is it inappropriate to reach out the employee on LinkedIn (we are connections already) and ask about their experience at the new agency? I've already been offered the position and haven't accepted it yet. I would want to ask about how the two agencies compare. Would it be a conflict of interest? Is it considered unprofessional?"
[CAN-ON] What would be your opinion on a potential candidate that includes their private business on their resume?,
[AZ][TX] I think I made an oopsie- working remotely out of state,"Hi everyone, early this year I started as a W2 contractor (I don‚Äôt get a 1099 but rather a W2). My first third-party client was in AZ (where I live) but when my contract ended, my employer found me a client in Texas and relocated me there. In my team, we had several people working remotely from different states so I asked my manager at the third-party client if I can work from my home state and he was fine with it, so I took his advice and would work from my home town from time to time. This was a verbal conversation and not written in writing.After scouring this subreddit for a while, I realize that there can be some ramifications to my actions. Since I was required to relocate to TX, I am paying TX taxes (I know there‚Äôs no state tax). But I only now realize that if I work from another state (even just one day), then I (and my employer) would need to pay that state‚Äôs taxes too (in this case, AZ). It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me to ask my actual employer to ask if they were okay with me working remotely back in AZ; however, I also read my contract and nowhere did it say we were required to stay put in the state if we were working remotely.I guess my question is, now that damage has been done, what can I do? Do I just come clean to my employer that I worked out of state for maybe a few weeks each month these past few months? I also know I can be terminated as a worst case scenario and of course, I don‚Äôt mind paying AZ taxes come tax time since that‚Äôs the right thing to do. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing the right thing now that I caught my mistake."
[CA] recently got promoted,"Hi all,I‚Äôm posting this to see if I can get any advice on how to handle my situation. I recently got promoted at my current job. I used to be an admin assistant but now work under a different boss and my responsibilities completely changed. I agreed to help with the admin work until my company hired a new admin but it‚Äôs been two months now and they have not put an offer for an admin. My current job is stressful since I‚Äôm working at a school so I have shared with my current boss that doing both has become stressful for me. I also raised my concern to my old boss which fyi she‚Äôs in charge of the whole department. My old boss didn‚Äôt agree with my concerns and she said that I agreed to help out. She said that my current boss can do without me for one day out of the week and I can do my admin work. I have also expressed that I‚Äôm doing two jobs and being paid for one and if it was possible to get a stipend which they did not answer back. I‚Äôm also still being introduced as the admin assistant and it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating.Next week I‚Äôm meeting with my old boss to discuss the situation. Is there any recommendations? should I work as the admin for one day out of the week or should I say no. Thanks!"
[CA] Not returning to my role after mat leave,"They gave away my job to someone else permanently. I'm due to return to work in February and had a chat with my boss about what life will look like when I return. It turns out my position has been permanently filled and they're moving me to another role completely. For context, I've been working my way up and finally landed a people manager role.Now I'll be working in projects and operations, a department I have no experience in, with no people management involved.How do I navigate this? Any advice?NOTE - I'm in Canada"
Coworker keeps telling me how I feel [TX].,"A coworker [F]  kept telling me [F] how I felt. I'm naturally assertive, in discussions I would share my opinion. We have difference in opinions, but she would tell me ""I can tell you're getting upset"" or ""I can tell you're getting mad""... I never was. In the moment I would clarify how I felt,  but she persists. Now she's gone to HR over my tone and how she felt. I'm at a loss. I thought things were fine.What should I do? What's an HR investigation like?"
[CA] What does HR say during background checks?,"I was offered unpaid leave when I wanted to quit my job due to reasons unrelated to work. I assume I still get benefits but no pay. But i am also not happy at this job and want to search for other jobs. What happens if I accept this leave and find another job during? Will the potential new employer learn I am on leave? And what else do they learn on background checks? Just job title, length of employment, and if you‚Äôre rehirable?"
[CAN-ON] Inappropriate Comments from a Staff Member about herself,"I'm an Executive Director working in a facility in a large city. I interviewed and hired a woman with solid experience for an administrative role at our facility.  She's been with us about two months. During the interview she talked a bit about her family and I was told her family had immigrated from Pakistan about 20 years ago.  She is approximately 45 or so. I'm raising the point of her birthplace because of comments she's been making.  About herself. When she is asked to do a task she doesn't want to do (which is not outside of her job description) she makes a statement like ""you're asking me to do this because I'm brown"". Apparently this has been going on for a few weeks but it was just reported to me. Three staff members brought this to my attention late last week. I have no idea where to start with this.  I want to support this woman in her job, but at the same time I understand that she needs to stop making these kinds of comments."
[CA] Slack profile picture,Can my employer require me to post a profile picture on my slack account?I find it intrusive and become uncomfortable at the thought of people randomly opening up my profile to look at my picture.
[BE] Making demands after HR fuck ups,"So I'm in the process of relocating to another country, for another position within the same company.The multiple HR people of the department keep fucking up my paperwork since the beginning by not talking to each other. My internal profile and salary have still not been updated after 2 months and 5 reminders, my relocation keeps being rejected bymecause they don't provide the proper paperwork (it's a company where people move around a lot, so they should be used to it), they can't even get my job description right, for God's sake. One HR makes some statement, which is false and then gets corrected by the others, but I need to dig in to discover it.I have to live to the other side of the planet and learn a new job. What they are doing to me is immensely stressful, when you take everything combined.For the record,they already messed up my previous assignments paperwork, and other high up people in the company let me hanging for 4 months without answers for other matters, that impacted my life quite a lot (like relocation decision, extension of missions,...).I don't blame anybody directly, but the entire process/department.This is a lack of respect and at this level, borderline incompetence.Can I make demands to compensate my pain, like 5-10% extra salary / 5 more paid holidays and maybe threaten to quit?I'm not indispensable (no one is...), but I've been there more than 4 years and know the people and the processes, which is very important in my new position. I do enjoy working there, but I hate this lack of respect.What do you professionals think?Edit : thanks all for the advices. Reason is coming to me after the initial fire and fury."
[UK] Need Desperate Advice in Addressing/Abruptly leaving Toxic Work Environment,"I left my previous company (engineering consultancy) on good terms some months back looking for something new. I found another consultancy closer to home that seemed like a great fit. It is a young and friendly team and from the beginning I thought I made the right choice. I was interviewed by the head of the discipline in another city, but I never met my line manager until I began working. Now after almost four months, I really cannot stand working with him and it has taken a great toll on my mental and physical health.While the rest of the team is really good to work with, he has shown himself to be very belittling, demanding, blunt, and overall difficult to work with. It's as if I am both working to meet deadlines for clients but have to continually watch my back to make sure he does not get upset about a minute detail on a spreadsheet. In terms of work, he is quick to nitpick any sort of small detail, does not show any encouragement whatsoever, and is never quite satisfied with my work even if I was up until 2am the previous day trying to get it done. Needless to say, he is not the kind of person I can go for help in project work, so I'm left to address ambiguities of my work on my own and hope that when he reviews it, he will agree with my approach.It's just has not been a healthy working environment and I want to leave. What's sad is that everything else about the team is amazing. However, as his only report I feel I'm the only one that really gets to see this side of him although I can see that the rest of team is a bit uncomfortable when it's comes to him. It's almost like a school bully scenario, where one simply does what they can to not get their attention.This month I have done what I can to get out, I've been sending applications and have already had a few interviews but have yet to hear back. The hard part is having to explain why I want to leave after only 4 months at the current place. From reading online, it seems prudent to never mention management issues so I've come up with an explanation that work is different from what I was expecting. In general I feel that I'm throwing up red flags since I'm changing so suddenly, but I'm not sure how I can deal with that.In the same vein, if I was to quit (which I could do with my savings), I'm afraid of then having to find a reason to explain what I did without the interviewer assuming I'm the issue. So I'm stuck in a really bad place, although I would quit even if I didn't have a job as it is too much. However, the practical side of me thinking of my future prevents me from doing so.Beyond this, I wanted to ask about how I can deal with references when I eventually do leave. There's another more senior engineer that I get along with and occasionally work with, that I could ask but I'm wondering about what I say when I leave to not ""burn bridges."" I keep being conflicted between making up some reason about being overworked instead of saying that it has been due to my line manager. Since I'm afraid that if I'm honest, I might be considered the issue and will not get a good reference which will then lead to the initial issues once more of not being able to secure a new job. The other thing is that I do need this reference since I have not been in the UK long and this is only my second job here. So not providing one from here might also throw some red flags.This is to say that I feel trapped in my current employment, but due to future prospective job opportunities, I am unable to quit as it might impede my employability further. I suppose I'm just wondering if any of you have gone through similar experiences and how did you deal with it. I would appreciate any advice."
[RI] Recession Layoff Question,"I am a salaried remote employee that has been working at my company for 3 years and have a very good rapport with all of my colleagues and managers. I have been thinking about going back to school part time and using the benefit the company offers of having them pay for it. For the folks that worked HR during the last recession, when looking at whom to layoff, is using the school payment benefit something you would use as a negative towards them and put them in the pile of possible layoffs?TIA"
[NY] Medical Documents,"HiTo give some background, our company went fully remote during the pandemic for two years. We were told that we are now fully back in the office earlier this year, maybe June?Some people did not take this well and quit. I was indifferent, not happy but you do what you gotta do. As I started coming in, I noticed many people were not. Someone on the team came in the first day, then WFH till last week when they found a better position elsewhere. Their boss is overseas (HQ is in a different country) so they didn‚Äôt notice or know they were not in the office. One team consisting of 4 people is entirely WFH and they come in every now and then to collect stuff that they ship to the office. When they come in we chat because it‚Äôs nice to see them. I know for fact that they don‚Äôt have any special case going on other than work life balance and their boss made it work.I recently was diagnosed with an illness/injury (end of last year). This is an illness that has no cure and will continue to get worse with time. It is all about pain management at this point. It causes me to be excruciating pain with triggers like riding the train, long car car rides, sitting for prolonged periods, among other things. I went to physical therapy while I was on a WFH schedule and it was helping a lot. Then when we were ordered to go back to office it started to get worse again. But I was still going to therapy. Then they cut me off, insurance will not cover.With the added commute of 5 days a week and sitting for 9 hours a day my body could not handle this level of aggravation. So I collected my medical paperwork that I had and requested a hybrid schedule. Long story short, it got denied by the lady that works in HR.A week later I am hospitalized and it‚Äôs been really rough lately. My PCP wrote me note saying I cannot come into the office and need to work from home for the next 4 weeks. I sent it in.I get a call from my PCP saying my job has been calling them every 5 mins for paperwork and if I have anything additional. I get my pain management place to expedite send over the documents to my PCP.However I had to sign a HIPPA document for that. Does my employer have the right to all my medical history?  Do I have any privacy in this case?"
"[CAN-ON] Signed offer letter, just waiting on background check. Am I safe to sign an apartment lease at this point?","I signed my official offer letter for a new role in Toronto, Ontario yesterday. I'll be relocating for the role. HR said all that remains is a background check, and I've been given a starting date (Nov 14th) as well as a letter of employment to provide to a landlord.Am I in the clear to sign a Nov. 1 apartment lease at this point if I have no concerns about my background check? I don't think I'll quit my current job until after the background check clears but this is all new to me so any advice is appreciated."
"[IL] Will having a MS in International Human Resources from France help or hurt me, should I return to the US?","I always told myself I‚Äôd do my masters in France. I‚Äôm 24/f from the US. I did my undergraduate in nonprofit admin and French and graduated in 2021. I worked full time as a recruiter until last November, then I went to teach English abroad. I‚Äôm now back in the US seeking a MSW because I like to help people, especially connecting with those who are not from the US. I realized a few weeks in that I don‚Äôt want to be a social worker and am now contemplating doing a MS in International HRM in France.My reservations are if this degree will be of any practical value, should I return to the US. It requires internships and allows you to gain work experience. Any thoughts are appreciated."
[CA] Nepotism in HR,"Hello!I had a quick question. Our company hired a new HR Director and after a week, he hired an HR Generalist. He changed the rate of pay by nearly 45% from an hourly position to salary. It also happens to be his sister, this was not disclosed but something I found out. He also hired a temp sales assistant with a different rate of pay higher than what we usually pay. This employee is also a friend of his and neither of the two positions were ever posted internally or externally. I was curious if this is allowed in HR in California?Thank you!"
[TX] I've been Mistakenly Underreporting my Hours,"Hello all,I got my first salaried position out of college about 6 months ago and it has been going well. When I first joined, I was told to make my timesheets equal 40 hours, which is how I allotted my time.Fast forward a few months, things got really busy and I was working well over 40 hours. However, I was still reporting my standard 40 hours (because when I joined that is what I was told to do). Nobody said anything, and I finally decided to ask a fellow coworker and they said I should have been reporting the hours the whole time.This whole situation kind of irks me because I have been working really hard and I don't feel like it is going to be recognized through the timesheet process because I was told wrong and didn't think much past that.I guess this comes down to my question: Is this something super important I need to bring up? Obviously, I will start reporting my full hours, but it it worth causing a stir?"
[MD] Am I overreacting about being touched by a coworker?,"I started working at this place about 3 months ago. At first this coworker was mean when I asked for help (I'm in training) but after being confronted by management they changed their ways. Come to find out that they have run several other workers away because of their actions.Fast forward to last month when I was checking a customer out they came behind me and started caressing my shoulders multiple times. I froze in panic and said nothing. But the next day I told them ""do not touch me"" and they quicky said ""ok"" like they wanted me hurry up and finish talking and go away.Recently they've started again by doing rough pats here and there. And then a few days ago when they were leaving they full on touched my back. This time I got a coworker as a witness.I want it to stop immediately because now I'm not being listed to! I feel like this person thinks it's a game. They also feel inclined to question me almost every shift about what I'm doing and should I be doing it. Mind you I could be standing for a second and they're on my neck! Asking me why I'm rubbing my hands together or why am I standing at the computer. This person has had several issues yet they're still at this company and no one wants to deal with the problems this person will cause if confronted. I get the touches may seem minor but it feels like a control thing because I'm young. At this point I feel stuck like I'm not being taken seriously. I need some help here."
[WA] Can employer remove emails exchanged in the employers portal that I forwarded to my personal email?,"(WA) I know it sounds ludicrous, but I can not locate the emails I forwarded from my work email to my personal email. I only have emails that originated from my personal email? Is it even possible for an employer to delete an email exchange even from someone‚Äôs personal email? I was terminated by a public school district and I‚Äôm pursuing unemployment insurance."
[PH] Are there still some ways to negotiate salary after accepting the job offer?,"[PH] Recently, I accepted the job offer that my new employer sent to me.During the time that I was negotiating for my salary, they didn't give me the salary that I asked for because they told me that my years of experience and ""my great potential during the interview"" (as they said) were not much relevant to the skills and experience of what my new work needs (which makes a great point). They also said that they still need to invest in my training to tailor fit me into my new role in the organization, and believed that the package they offered to me is a representation of what they think is fair based on my experience.I accepted the job offer since their reason is fair enough, and their offer is way better than what I am currently earning.Then, days after accepting the job offer, I remembered about my License (as a Mechanical Engineer) and thought about using it as another means of negotiating for my salary.I don't want to have a bad impression on the company as I may have a higher chance of starting to look like a liability to them, but are there still some ways to negotiate salary after accepting the job offer? After all, we want to have the most of the opportunity given to us.PS. I am currently completing the pre-employment requirements, and am thinking about asking the recruiter why are they not asking for my PRC License (an aggressive way) or giving them copies of my PRC License as an additional pre-employment requirement (a passive way). Are these ideas fine?"
"[Ga] My wife is being laid off but will be paid for a couple months and get a severance package at the end, can she go ahead and get another job?","Like the title says, my wife is being laid off by her company. She is given the opportunity to post for other internal opportunities and they will continue to pay her for a couple months while looking. If she does not take one, at the end of those 2 months she will get a severance package of 2 more months all at once.She is not interested in staying, because the available rolls would be a major step down in pay and schedule, so she is determined to go external. If she accepts a new external roll before the 2 months is up, does she have to inform them? Would this cause her to give up the severance package? I know this is typically based on company policy, but the policy only states you can‚Äôt work for a competitor.Thoughts?"
[TX] FMLA / LoA Question!,"FMLA QuestionHi!Not sure if this is the correct thread, but appreciate any help y‚Äôall can provide!Here‚Äôs the situation:Me, 29yo female employed as full time project manager (salary + benefits) at a tech firm. My company provides Short Term Disability insurance for a FMLA leave of absence (60% of weekly pay, up to 12 weeks). I submitted a LoA request and claim is being evaluated now.The context - I am currently dealing with cervical spine stenosis / annual fissure (tear) in my c5-c6 disc that‚Äôs causing nerve damage from the disc space narrowing. My left hand periodically goes numb and I have trouble with bladder control. More significantly - I am in extreme pain at the end of every workday, it‚Äôs a dull aching the rest of the time. I am a candidate for surgery and am undergoing testing now (neurological + CT scan) to justify and schedule the disc replacement surgery.The injury was borne from being a hospice caregiver to my father this year before he passed, as well as working ~60 hours / week from under resourcing at my job (I used to take calls from his bedside at times). I took a 3 week LoA for bereavement but was forced to come back early due to leadership change.My question: this FMLA leave and request seems to be centered around a surgery date, of which there isn‚Äôt one yet. Truthfully - I can‚Äôt do this job anymore as I feel like the stress is literally eroding me. I‚Äôve been saying for ~7 weeks that I am drowning, if anything the workload has gotten worse, and this LoA is the only thing that has gotten management to listen. HR has been 0% helpful on all fronts.What happens if for some reason I don‚Äôt have the surgery during the leave? Leave is scheduled to begin 11/14 and my CT myelogram is scheduled for 11/22.My doctor will 100% sign off on needing a leave, but do I need to update my claim? What should I do??"

[CA] I just landed a job that I discovered was replacing someone on a temp leave what is HR planning?,"I was super excited after being unemployed for a few months to land a 6 month contract to hire role with a big company with good pay. I just found out today however (my 2nd day of work) that my role is/was replacing a someone who‚Äôs been on a leave and is coming back at the end of the month.Where does that put me apart from pinning me up against someone who already knows all the software and has good relationships vs a newbie trying to figure things out and will make mistakes along the way invetilby. I don‚Äôt know if I should bring this up to them or just secretly look for a new job. But I‚Äôm at will right now on this contract, I do need the money but I don‚Äôt want to invest time and effort into something that ultimately might get me fired for no reason.They told me that they will have her do a little bit of everything but it sounds like they don‚Äôt really have a solid plan in place for her which probably means they don‚Äôt have one for me either. I‚Äôm just so frustrated and exhausted because this is my 10th job I can‚Äôt seem to land a non toxic permanent position all I keep getting is these temp roles that never amount to anything and it‚Äôs lowering my self esteem and value.

Changing Payroll Dates in [CA],"I'm a manager at a small business, just 8 employees including myself. I'm HR, AR/AP, Operations, etc. I'm the only admin person as all the other guys are our technicians. The owner lives out of state so i essentially run everything except pressing submit for payroll.Due to how the owner originally set it up the payroll schedule situation is fubar. For example next Monday he will have me give him the payroll numbers for the payroll checks to be distributed Friday. The issue is is that next weeks payroll is for this current week and for next week rather than the prior 2 weeks so we are running payroll as if they were there every day of the week that we are running payroll. Its stupid and it leads to people being sick or calling off and them ""owing"" a shift from the following payroll.I want to change this as it gives me too much stress to keep track of. How do i go about swapping to where we are paying out for the prior 2 weeks in a way that wont cause issues for my guys? How do i phrase exactly what I'm planning on doing to them so that they understand why its changing? Just want to make sure im doing right for my guys making the transition."
"[CA] Management asking me to do double the work for a different job title that I was led to believe I already had, but never did.","Hello - I'll try to summarize my story as much as I can, but it may still be a little lengthy. (sorry)I've worked for a small company for over 7 years, and we were acquired about 2 years ago. A little over year ago, two employees left our company and therefore me and another person were asked by the acquiring company if we could take over the roles - which is a different job title (Marketing to Project Management). I agreed thinking my title would change and perhaps even a pay adjustment would eventually follow. (My fault for assuming)About 4 months ago, the acquiring company began ""restructuring"". The other guy and I were told that since we're now project managing, we would now be reporting to a new manager from the acquiring company. Obviously, my original boss from the original company wasn't too happy about his team being taken away. In the end, the ""change"" happened, and we've been reporting to the new manager.About 3 weeks ago, lay-offs happened and the person that had their ""role changed"" with me was also let go. I came to find out from my old boss that HR had asked him to let go of the other person. He told HR that he wasn't our manager, and that their ""new manager"" should be the one doing the lay-off.After discussing with my old boss, he followed-up on why he was still being considered as the manager for myself and the other person. Upper management told him that it was the best way to go about it without making a mess with ""cross company "" resources and management.I asked my new manager about my title, and he played the ""I didn't know your title didn't change"" role. Yet he was making the argument to upper management that myself and this other person should be under his management 4 months ago.As you can imagine, I'm not very happy that not only I didn't get a title change, I didn't get an income adjustment or bonus, but now I'm expected to handle double the workload of a different job title while still have my Marketing title.My question is this. Is this even ethical?? What are my options, leave?"
[CA]Received a job offer letter but not on-boarding documents or start date.,"So I worked at this place a few times through a temp gig app and they asked me if I would like to get hired. I said yes but I was gonna be out of state for a week but they said I could start after.Now it is the complicated part. Until the end of the month, I work with that company through the gig app. I told the manager and she was ""It's OK, you can work those shifts through the app since you can't really cancel all of those gigs and avoid penalties.""I received the job offer letter and a background checked which I passed. The supervisor informed me in person and told the manager it is up to her now for the schedule.The thing is I have not received any I-9 or an exact start date. They also hired a person who had experience unlike me. I have more interviews lined-up, should I keep interviewing? Or contact HR of that company to give me more insight? I am located in California.The offer letter states this too:""This offer letter is not a contract for employment.  Employment with our Company is at-will. It is not for a specified period of time and can be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without cause or notice, by the Team Member or by the Company.

Self Evaluation: Do I make it ‚ÄúHR official/on record‚Äù or just between my boss and I? [CA],"Hi. I‚Äôve been at my role for about 3 months and have to hand in my self evaluation soon. My boss/department head told us we had the ‚Äúoption for it to be official, so HR can see our self evaluation or unofficial‚Äù, the latter of which would mean it‚Äôs just between ourselves and our boss. Our boss of course also does an employee evaluation, which I would assume goes on our HR record? (But I also don‚Äôt know?)What is the benefit for having a self evaluation be on the record? And if an employee opts for this, is it possible a manager may take it the wrong way somehow?I have a reasonably good relationship with my boss, and though I am still learning (and a little wobbly), I can‚Äôt imagine I have major cause for concern about my employee evaluation, given the feedback so far has been mostly positive aside from constructive criticism as I‚Äôve been learning.. which I think is to be expected.I would like to eventually (like 1-2 years from now) get promoted to the level above my currently position, but again, I wouldn‚Äôt know if that means I should be making these reviews ‚Äúon record‚Äù, given my boss is fairly senior anyway, and would be the one to make that call."
Working remotely with non-communicative manager [FL] and [IL],"Hello,My manager and I both live in Florida but work for a global ""ad"" agency headquartered in Illinois.Situation:I'm seven months into a new position having been recruited by my manager directly. Our small team is 100% remote and the culture seems to be heavily reliant on chat and emails and is very meeting-averse. This usually results in tasks being assigned via long format emails or very quick chat messages with links to Google Docs and/or presentation decks, followed by a very brief and unstructured 30-minute MS Teams call.Over the last several projects, I've received assignments that lacked clear direction or were so vague that it required more detailed instruction and specifics regarding the actual action to be made, the people involved, and roles and responsibilities. We've had several miscommunication mishaps over the months as a result of us not being aligned.  I've made several recommendations on how to resolve some of these issues, but these have usually been met with a ""no.""Most of the issues I've identified are the result of lack of clarity, lack of information, or limited knowledge. I don't want to put my manager in a bad position, and have asked for a meeting to discuss these situations and resolve them, but my manager appears to be resistant to it. We are supposed to have weekly catch-ups, which consistently get canceled (usually 5 minutes before the scheduled meeting). Sometimes these meetings are rescheduled and canceled again, or canceled and never rescheduled.More specific to my question for this group: I worry that this behavior is going to reflect poorly on my performance and personal record with the company (which I really like and would like to stay at). I feel like I'm trying to do everything I can to resolve the situation but am running into walls. I'm over-communicating, sending weekly and sometimes daily reports/updates, taking initiative where possible, and delivering above and beyond when possible. But I feel these attempts are actually making it worse. There have been times my manager and I won't communicate for a week or more, or situations where I'm assigned projects, make a suggestion that my manager is opposed to... then I'm suddenly removed from the project only to find out later that my junior colleague took it over and implemented the suggestion I originally made. And, because the work we do is design/communications-related, I've offered to take part in any presentation meetings to help present these concepts and ideas, but have never been invited.It's been 7 months and I still haven't met anyone outside of my immediate team. And so I can't tell if this behavior is isolated to our small team, or is indicative of the entire organization culture.In August, every employee at the company was supposed to have their annual review meeting to define their personal objectives and KPIs. It's October and I haven't had mine yet. My colleague has had hers, but the last few times my review was scheduled, it was canceled.What are my options? Do I report this to HR? Do I have any recourse? Should I look for another position in the company or just move on?"
[TX] An on-call employee is creating a schedule for my staff and trying to convince them to threaten to quit. How do I word my email?,"I work for a nonprofit shelter and make the weekly schedule. We have permanent staff as well as on-call. The on-call employees give me their availability and I make everyone's schedule 1 week in advance. Currently, we are understaffed, so we have some on-call staff members working full-time and even overtime if they want it, which is never required even for our full-time staff. A few of our on-call staff actually do a lot of OT because the money is great and the job is not stressful. I manage 2 shelters and if we don't have enough coverage I go in. I am supposed to work 2 days on-site and 3 at home, however since we're so short staffed I am there a lot more, I went in last Saturday and came back Sunday night. I don't expect this of anyone else, I am the manager so I do whatever needs to be done to make sure our clients are taken care of, I just wanted you all to know I am not asking them to do anything I would not do.Now my issue is one of our on-call employees does not want to wants to dictate her own schedule weekly. She found an on-call schedule online and sent it out to the rest of the staff and me. She told me that it would be a way to make sure everyone only works one weekend a month and the others agree with her and are not happy with their schedules. No one has complained to me at all, I have an open-door policy so if they want to talk about anything my office is always open. If someone wants/needs to be off they just tell me and I make it work, I don't even require 48-hour notices because I honestly know life happens and some days you just need a mental health day, we work with DV victims so it can take a toll. And her coworkers are the ones coming to me with this information.This employee is calling her coworkers and telling them to come to me and complain and threaten to quit. I am not worried about losing anyone, the job is easy and very convenient for people who can't work a regular 8-5 schedule. I have spoken with her and she does not care. She told me at this point she is going to create a rotating schedule and present it to everyone. I am frustrated because she is seriously undermining me and trying to create drama where there is not any. I want to know how I should properly handle this. I want to send her an email and will cc HR and my boss. How should I word this email? I know it has to be professional but a big part of me just wants to tell her ""If you don't like it, quit!"" I won't do that, however.TLDR: On-call employee undermining me and creating a work schedule that is rotating. I schedule on-call staff based on availability and need and they have it 1 week in advance. How do I word this email asking her to stop and that she is being very unprofessional?"
[OH]Can I still give a 2 week notice considering this is the resignation policy?,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôve decided to leave my job due to workplace bullying and being overworked and underpaid. If you‚Äôre interested in the details I would be more than happy to share because it‚Äôs actually pretty terrible. I‚Äôve shared the issue with other people and all have suggested I leave because it seems like I am being micromanaged and bullied.I went through the organizations employee handbook and it says that there are steps an employee needs to take in order to be released from their contract. It says that the organization will only ‚Äúattempt‚Äù to accommodate this request by recommending release providing the following guidelines are followed:‚Ä¢ The employee MUST inform his/her coordinator that they are investigating other employment opportunities at the time the process begins‚Ä¢ The employee must keep the supervisor up-to-date during the process. This information includes all relevant information such as school systems involved, interview dates, and possible timetables.‚Ä¢At the appropriate time, the employee must submit a letter of resignation to the superintendent or chief of Human Resources & talent office with the proposed termination date.‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúX‚Äù benefits will end date of termination or with non-renewals end of contractI am confused because it seems like it is not as simple as giving a 2 weeks notice which the handbook says is required. So let‚Äôs say I haven‚Äôt been looking for other jobs. Can I just submit the two weeks notice? I do not have a teaching contract with this organization. It says that anyone with a teaching contract cannot accept a job in another public school district unless you are properly released from your contract. I asked Human Resources to send me a copy of my contract and they responded via email that we do not have actual contracts.It also says ‚Äúall employees are encouraged not to leave during the fiscal year, however, a two-week notice is required upon resignation to assure re-hire status. No employee will be released until a suitable replacement is found.‚ÄùI would appreciate any advice or support for this. Thank you!"
[UK] My manager talking about me to others,"So I had my first performance review with my new manager last week - in our workplace we have a tool where you can request feedback from your colleagues so your manager can see it. In the performance review, my manager asked me what I made of the feedback I received and so on which I didn‚Äôt really think anything of it.Until today, where I had a 121 with one of my colleagues whom I asked feedback from and they told me that prior to my performance review - my manager had put in a meeting with them to ask how I‚Äôm doing! I‚Äôve never known/heard of any managers doing this and my manager didn‚Äôt disclose this to me in our performance review either.I then went to look at my manager‚Äôs calendar and see another meeting there with another colleague that I work with very closely.I don‚Äôt know what to make of this as they didn‚Äôt disclose any of this to me - should I be nervous about this? I felt the performance review went well but now getting mixed feelings based on this."
[WA] Manager is Confiding Suicidal Thoughts to Employee (me),"TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts.My job started a week and a half before we were all sent home for COVID two and half years ago or so. She is the bottleneck for communication with the company, and we have many issues and incompatibilities, but she's a nice person and so I have not been good about work boundaries (I have my own mental health stuff and non-confrontation challenges).Her health has been deteriorating this entire time resulting in her having to take a lot of time off. Recently, in venting her frustration about her health she mentioned that it's bad enough that she wished she could just kill herself. I was so uncomfortable, but knew that if I told her I was, she'd feel bad while already feeling suicidal so I just gave comfort.The thing is, she's already not a good manager and makes me nuts unless we're talking about non-work stuff. So, I don't want to even deal with the emotional labor of being her impromptu counselor. Because I haven't been assertive, I don't know if can suddenly start now without it being a massive issue. But I seriously don't want her to talk to me about this topic.Additionally, this is my first real white collar job outside of retail and food service, which weren't great for HR assistance, in my previous experience, so I'm really unsure how to even go about doing anything or what it would look like."
[CA] How to approach interviews for jobs for which I'm wildly overqualified?,"Hi HR pros.I'm burnt out. I've spent the last decade in management consulting working an obscene amount of hours, travelling almost every week and I just need a break. I could competitively be applying for Sr Director / VP level positions in F500 companies but I just don't have it in me right now and want to take it easy for a few years. I don't really need the money but I also don't want to just do no work at all so I've started applying for some local analyst / BA positions that are 4-5 levels below what I'm coming from professionally and a massive pay cut and I'm having a hard time convincing the corporate recruiters that this isn't some sort of practical joke or something.I'd prefer not to lie and dumb down my resume in my search for a nice simple 9-5 and would appreciate some guidance on how to convince these companies that I'm actually a serious candidate."
"[WA] Salary with paid overtime, being sent to a work conference.","Very small company. Two owners, I manage the business, they ignore me until I need something from them or they need something from me. I make the money for them and keep them happy.I know this isn't the standard, but I'm a salaried employee and I still get paid for overtime. I requested this as part of my promotion and they were happy to put it in writing. My hours are half onsite and half work from home, and I do the WFH bits when it's convenient for me. This works pretty well for everyone involved.Typically if I need to work more than my standard 40 hours, the WFH bits can be shaved off to make up for it. IE I work four hours onsite on a Saturday, I don't do my WFH on Friday to even things out.I have a work conference out of town Thursday-Sunday. I'm flying to and from. How much time should I consider 'work' time, and what would be a reasonable amount of time to ask off in exchange? Is there a standard behavior in this sort of scenario?Thank you for reading!"
[AR] [DC] Position eliminated‚Äù or fired?,"Our national marketing team was recently reorganized. We gathered near at our HQ this week to discuss the new changes. Shortly before the second day of meetings, my boss asked if I could talk. During this rather impromptu meeting in public, he shared that my position was being eliminated, and that I could consider a new role that includes my current responsibilities, plus three other (rather major) marketing functions which I‚Äôm not qualified for. He also shared that I‚Äôd need to relocate to Arkansas by Feb 1. He knows my partner‚Äôs job is in DC and we recently moved into a new home last month. I was not given a job description or salary offer during the conversation, and followed up to ask for it.Employer is based in Arkansas. Employee works in Washington, DC.Questions:Legally, would this be considered being fired? For unemployment, etc.Do I have any recourse? I imagine Arkansas is pretty business friendly.Any other considerations / advice on this situation is welcome."
[CA] exit survey questions,"Long story short, I decided to quit my job after having a terrible experience at the company, and thinking about it for a long time. I got my exit survey emailed to me around 3-4 days after I quit (at my company they don‚Äôt do a 2 weeks notice even if you offer, the day you quit is your official last day) and I had started it but hadn‚Äôt finished/submitted it yet. I was honestly pretty upset with the company when I left, and I had a lot of feedback to give, so I wanted to have some time to fully collect my thoughts and figure out the most professional way to articulate everything before submitting it.  (At my company you get sent an exit survey instead of having an actual meeting with HR)I was going to submit the exit survey today (about 1 week since they sent the survey) but now it is saying the link is expired so it‚Äôs too late.  I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal because I already left, but I never really had the chance to give any feedback while I was there so I basically just have a lot to get off my chest. Wouldn‚Äôt HR have to disclose if there is a deadline to submit the exit survey feedback? And if not, do u think it‚Äôs likely for them to re-active the link or still let me submit it?Also, what does HR actually do with the information from the exit survey, and how quickly do they share the info? Like would it be obvious which employee it was coming from?"

[OH] Bad Interview,I just had an EA phone job interview for a job that I really want at a company I‚Äôd love to work for for an amazing job with a great salary. Unfortunately I feel like I really bombed the interview. :( I already sent a thank you email to the interviewer but I am wondering if anyone has ever sent an email asking for a second chance interview and how to write up that request professionally. I‚Äôm thinking I could explain that I was feeling under the weather/dealing with a heavy migraine. I‚Äôm sure it could not hurt to ask? Any thoughts?

[TO] As a conversationalist should I purposefully not include a Cover Letter?,"Ok I let me explain. I'm  a recent graduate and most of my internships I have gotten were from jobs where I never submitted a cover letter. I have been taught that having a good cover letter is very important (something I am currently working on).I'm a conversationalist, and I think I do well in most interviews (I think LMAO). My issue is that I am not the best writer. Though I can do well writing, I much prefer getting into a room with someone, sitting down and talking, rather than trying to expand on my experience and skills through a single paged document paired with my resume.So is it ever a strategy or does it ever make sense to purposefully forgo a cover letter when it is not required? or does not including a cover letter only lower my chances of getting an interview and a job?Many thanks for any responses!!!"

[IA] Employee just walked out‚Ä¶,"Weird situation.  Employee was having a conversation with the boss.  The boss asked for some clarification as the employee had given a confusing response to a question.  Now, this employee has been very difficult to have a conversation with over their employment.Instead of answering, employee stormed out slamming a door.  Hour or so later came back and dumped uniform shirts on my desk without a word.  I asked what to tell the boss - ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù was the reply and out the door he slammed again.In Iowa, am I required to payout his PTO?  It does state clearly in our handbook -The Company will only compensate employees for unused PTO when the employee works throughout the notice period and is not terminated for misconduct or cause; otherwise, unused PTO will be forfeited.Iowa has been changing some laws and I want to make sure my employer is covered.  I do a large portion of want would be considered HR work, only because we are such a small company.   Boss believes that under the circumstances - the PTO is forfeit due to the employee just up and walking off to not return."

"[CA] FMLA ending, need to start Short term disability (std) leave immediately after","Background: Wife has been with tech company in Midwest for 15 months and super stressed between work and caring for mom with dementia. She‚Äôs on FMLA now (paid parental care leave from work also kicks in for six weeks) and the 12 month period ends next month 11/15.Situation: Due to caregiving her mom and spending time in the nursing home and witnessing other patients and her mom‚Äôs poor health, she‚Äôs developed a debilitating anxiety and depression. Unable to sleep, heart palpitations and overall burned out. The doctors are suggesting she go on psych meds ( Zoloft) and also asking her to take some time off to relax and recuperate.Decision: she has decided to continue with her work leave beyond FMLA. Doctor and friends have advised she transition into a short term disability (std) leave right after her FMLA ends, so that way it will be a smooth transition and she doesn‚Äôt have to go back to work and encounter any more stressors. Her STD is running concurrently with her Fmla so she will have 26-12 = 14 weeks of paid std remaining she can take.Question: can her employer fire her for taking the short term disability right after Fmla ? And even if they fire her will she be able to continue getting the short term disability? What other issues does she need to be mindful of.Thanks for your advise and comments.

"[SE] My company is moving to a new office space, which is causing some issues for me","The company where I work is moving to a new office space. In the transition, we are also moving from arranged seating to an ""open workplace"" with free seating.My problem is that I work with image- and video editing, product design and development, some light VFX work - basically tasks that are pretty hardware demanding and colour sensitive. This means that today I have two calibrated monitors and a tower workstation PC.The problem is that I need to follow the new policy of free seating and A: Need a laptop and B: Need to calibrate or work around whatever monitor I am placed infront of each day.Edit: I should mention that I am basically the only one at the company with these requirements. We have a photograpger - but she works remotely, as does our graphic designer.Is there anything I can do to mitigrate or work around this? What demands can I make?Edit: I have talked to both my boss (new since 2 weeks) and the owner. The reply I was given is that ""policy is policy"" and no exceptions will be made. This is most likely due to the ""free seating arrangements"" not being a popular move and most would prefer a permanent desk. Should also mention that it is a small company with some 20 employees in total.I am also unsure if there is a laptop that can actually ourperform my current workstation.

So, I sent a thank-you email to the line manager that interviewed me, and I got a reply from him, saying congratulations and stuff. Does this mean I‚Äôll 100% get the job?

[AZ] Preemployment drug screening & prescriptions,"This is for a behavioral health job (admin position) in Arizona, non governmental.My wife has just signed a job offer, pending results of a background check and drug screening. She is on prescription for a controlled substance that is being tested for. She tested with Lab Corp.When she went, she brought her script with her and offered to show them. They refused to take the info, and said someone would contact her later about it after the results come in.That lines up with everything we have read. However, after she gave the sample she asked how long it would take for results to come in, and when to expect their call. The lab tech then told her that they give the results to the employer, and it would be the employer who contacts her.This last part goes against everything we have read. Does this sound right? It should be the lab, or their medical review officer, who contacts her, and there should be no reason for the employer to know anything about any prescriptions she has, according to everything we have read.Any input is appreciated."

[NY] Should I file a complaint against my manager with HR?,"I was moved into a newly acquired company under a new manager a year ago as part of a restructuring, and my manager and I don‚Äôt have the best relationship. I don‚Äôt trust them, and I feel like they are trying to freeze me out of the business.This past year, they basically kept me on ice while I continued to manage my accounts on my former dept‚Äôs technology platform, which was being phased out.Management called the restructuring a merger, but basically the employees have been left to solve all the issues ourselves, which includes waiting for my accounts to transfer to the new org‚Äôs operating environment.I don‚Äôt think my manager has supported me during the merger or made me part of the new org.For example, they don‚Äôt hold team meetings. They communicate poorly, and they don‚Äôt hold individual meetings. So there‚Äôs little feedback given or received, and I‚Äôm not really part of a team. There are also little things like not turning on their camera on Teams calls. Exception, if their boss is also on the call, then the camera comes on - but not for direct reports.Recently, with the start of the new fiscal year, our dept‚Äôs director (my boss‚Äôs boss) appointed me to lead part of my manager‚Äôs team alongside another team lead, but my manager has undermined this. Before I could start the role, they did an about-face and told me to stick to my current duties.They are one of those why-because-I-say-so bosses, and their tone has also become a bit harsh in emails. ‚ÄúYou must not‚Ä¶‚Äù. I respond much better to a friendly ask, like most people.I escalated this to our director but she doesn‚Äôt answer my emails. So it seems mgmt wants me to deal directly with my line manager, who isn‚Äôt replying to my emails. And really does not seem to care.I have a longer list with more examples collected this past year, but I really don‚Äôt want to escalate this to HR. What other options do I have to protect myself from this bad actor?TLDR: Should I report a bad manager to HR? They are not supporting the company‚Äôs merger and I feel unable to do my job for our customers."
[IL] I dont know how to ask this question,"[Context, 27 year old male. Degree in information systems]. So ive been with my current company for about 2.5 years (started first week march 2020). In september 2021 i was given a review that basically said i was failing to meet the standards set by my boss. I was devistated, but attempted to turn things around for the better. I tried to work harfer and smarter. Then, back in April, i was approached to do training for a promotion to a new position (think level 1 software engineer going to level 2) but needed to complete the training. The training is 6 months and has nothing to do with my current job. Anyways, im currently in the training  I had a meeting with my boss and asked about what will come after the training. He said an evaluation period. He also said, while improvement was made on my end, he still wasnt happy with my progress before the training. He said, and i quote, ""my work didnt bring value to the company"" and the training was ""a generouse offer by the company"" to me. That really rubbed me the wrong way. Part of me wants to find another job but im afraid to look for new opportunities because i fear they will contact my current employer and they will give a negative neview about me. Then not only willni be out a new job but ill have the stink of  my boss knowing i tried to leave on me. I dont know what to do and the whole situation has made me very depressed. Im not sure what im asking here but i just need advice."

Consequences to having ethics [NC],"Hey there, AskHR. Long-time listener, first-time caller (as it were). I have sort of an ethical dilemma I'm faced with. I'm a newly minted leader at my company and we recently hired a new CXO who I report to, directly. About a month ago, I was at dinner with said CXO and our entire department (which I lead). We were celebrating a few recent new-hires and having dinner at a crowded restaurant. An important note, I'm wearing a company shirt at this dinner so we are easily identifiable.While we waited for our food to arrive, this CXO suddenly and apropos of nothing in the conversation, drops the N-word. My jaw dropped as I nervously looked around. He then proceeds to explain how he would never say the [says it again] in an offensive way to anyone - he's not a racist. But if he were playing some really competitive basketball, might call someone the [says it a third time] in the spirit of competitiveness.I quickly changed the subject and we moved on. The next day, I set up a call with my boss and called out his behavior the previous day, professionally, explaining that not only did it offend employees, but me, and probably other patrons, and because I was wearing the company polo! He apologized and said it would never happen again.Since then he has made a few other comments, for example using the R-word in reference to a current team member (behind closed doors). Actively ridicules other leaders and employees in front of others. He has also verbally threatened my and my employees careers several times. He's creating a toxic environment and I feel a very clear need to speak to HR. But, I also want to not get fired or worse. To be clear, I have a selfish interest here. This person is very well-known and liked in our industry. He has the connections to completely blackball me in addition to firing me. I understand that there may be anti-retaliation laws in place, but I very much doubt this would stop him.Should I report him and potentially risk my career? Apparently another employee who recently quit already mentioned it to HR, but it sounds like they're not doing anything about it."
[CAN-AB] Employee let go without cause by unhealthy manager. What can be done?,"I work in a Not for profit between 250-500 employees.Yesterday my coworker messaged me on LinkedIn that her manager terminated her. A few moments before that this exchange happened between myself and my coworkers manager. This is not my manager. This is another manager from another program. My manager is aware of this exchange.Manager: Comes into my office and snaps, ""I need you to call HR right now!"".Me: Are you unable to call them yourself?Manager: No. PLEASE. She walks back to her office.Context: I don't know what's going on, but I have an idea my coworker is being fired at this point. As the day before my coworker came to me and said her manager has been coming at her a lot. I suggest to my coworker that she bring this up to HR or her manager's manager is she feels comfortable.Today coworker told me they indeed sent a message to Manager's manager to discuss Managers behavior toward them.So I have an idea and some context to this situation. But when Managr came into my office and snapped at me to do something for her. I felt she was demanding me to do a task she was capable of, calling HR. And I was working on my own projects. Had she came in and said he I need support, I would have responded more positively. But I don't like being snapped at.Anyway. Today coworker informs me HR has terminated her an the letter says without cause. I have not seen the letter, but I beleive my coworker. I have no proof but I beleive coworkers Manager fired them so they could not talk to Manager's manager.Coworker's Manager has been the reason at least 4 people have left the company in the last year."
[CA] Can my boss cut hours if I ask for reasonable accommodations?,"I feel weird asking this because I‚Äôm actually the person who writes the majority of policies for our company but I reached a circumstance that I‚Äôm not entirely sure the legality of it.Recently my health has been declining. I‚Äôm a business manager but I am hourly. My boss and I have a great relationship so these last few months they‚Äôve known about my health. Recently I‚Äôve had even worse symptoms to the point where I am considering reasonable accommodation for hybrid work.My boss was trying to be friendly and make a comment saying she can make me part time so I can focus on my appointments but for one, the amount of work required from my position, part time wouldn‚Äôt work and 2 I‚Äôm already losing out on hours for all my appointments.I‚Äôve never taken a sick day, my bosses have known about all my appointments days in advance. I have left early maybe twice in the last year.My boss is also the owner of the company and my HR representative. I don‚Äôt have anyone above them.*just want to add an edit that emphasizes I DO NOT want to be part time. My bosses are suggesting they will cut my hours due to my health even though I‚Äôve been working 40+ hours a week consistently. I NEVER asked for less hours. Their offer to make me part time would cause more of a hardship on the company. I know this because I literally handle all the finances. There is no one to train my position or take my position.To me, and my experience in HR and with my bosses, it feels like they want to use my disability to save money (I‚Äôm one of the highest paid senior staff)."
[TX] Cancellation of short term disability without notice but still being payed into,"State: TexasHello all, My wife and I are expecting our first kid in December and she has been paying into short term disability well before the pregnancy. Our doctor advised us to start the process now that way when the baby comes we will be all set but when my wife asked her HR lady about it, she informed her that ‚Äúnot enough people signed up for it so we decided to cancel it‚Äù. Obviously shocked by the news, my wife asked why did I have to mention it to you in order to be informed about this? HR lady replied she was going to get to it eventually‚Ä¶ We are shocked and so lost because we rely on both incomes to keep a roof over our heads and food on our plates. Does anyone have any recommendations on what we can do because we are stressing so hard now. She has been into a cancelled policy for god knows how long. I am now thinking of getting a second job outside my current military job due to this."
[OR] Background check?,I'm a new graduate nurse who is applying for a new job after leaving a past job during the probationary period (7 weeks) after mutually agreeing with my manager that the unit I was in was not a good fit for me. I recently accepted a new nurse position at a new hospital that is offering more support than the last one I was at. The only thing I need to do before starting is the background check and references. Does anyone know what I should expect when they are doing the background check? As a side note: I did not list the last position on my resume as advised by fellow nursing peers as it was during a probationary period and it being too short. Not sure if this will impact my background check in anyway.
[CA] Should I tell my prospective/past manager about major surgery?,"Hi! I am a graduate student who has interned at a company 2x. I am still in their system as an on call employee, and was supposed to work for them this past summer. They send out returning offer letters the day you leave, and offer no extensions, so I had to sign yes or no over a year ago, and I said yes. However, I had a verbal agreement with my manager that if I failed my exams, I would be unable to return as an intern as scheduled because my PhD has to come first. (about 50% of people fail this exams on the first try so we knew it was likely)I failed, and emailed him, but it turned out he was promoted to a different, more technical role and there was a new manager. I informed the new manager that I had to back out of my agreement, and he was very accomodating, offering to push my start date (it was too late bc as soon as I failed I took on research load after the retakes since I needed to fill my summer) and they took it in stride, and I said I would love to return in the future, which they said they would really like!Now, a 3rd manager [who I know from my 2 summers there but was never my boss] has asked if I am coming next summer, as through the grapevine ""I would love to return in the future"" meant I was PLANNING on coming specifically NEXT SUMMER. They have been holding a spot for me during recruiting apparently and need to confirm and have me sign a new contract.I, in theory, would love to work there next summer-and want to retain my relationship with this department in this company-But I have a prophylactic double mastectomy scheduled-I will be out of commission for months. I have no choice I cannot come, and I will be uber behind on school work so I cannot come off cycle.My main question is which will hurt a relationship more: Me ""flaking"" again without justification, after in their mind I promised to come back on a set timeline, or them starting to worry I am medically complex (even if they are supposed to not care, they 1000% will, based on my peers experiences with chronic medical conditions and employers)."
[OR] How to work with a boss that doesn't listen or communicate with you?,"My boss doesn't seem to put much thought into the information I provide nor respond to my emails. When I do receive responses during verbal they are always ambiguous and if I ask a question I get a stern look from them that says ""you should know what I'm saying"" along with a verbal ""what do you mean?""It's disheartening when they respond to others emails and disregard mine.What are some good strategies to get better communication especially email responses with non-ambiguous answers."
[AU] is my pay Fairly Balanced!?,"Hey everyone, i just discovered this community and I‚Äôm not too sure if my thread relates to the the community but please give your opinion on my dilemma. I work in a small retail store on a casual hourly pay. Our store has about 15 employees and everyone is casual. At one shift the store is managed by one staff all times. I am a full time uni student and i work about 3 night shifts 8 hours each which helps me to balance out my study properly and paying my bills. I have been working here for past 2 years. On night shifts we have 3 staff in total (including me) where I usually do 3 shifts and other 2 do 2 shifts each. I was asked by my store owner and manager that one of the night staff was going overseas for a month and half (6 weeks) and if i would cover his shifts. To which I happily agreed as i had a month of uni vacations after my exams and i found this as an opportunity to save some additional money and contribute to my uni fees. I also took few shifts off in my exam considering that i could recover the money doing more shifts in future weeks. When the other staff finally took off for his trip i saw the roster and i had the same 3 shifts but 1 of 3 on weekend ( penalty rates). I asked my boss and he said that the other colleague wanted to make bit more money than usual so he gave him 2 extra shifts. He believes that its fairly balanced since i would make about 850 dollars a week and the other colleague doing 4 shifts would make about 1100 a week. I usually make  780 a week doing 3 shifts and other colleague who did 2 shifts made 550 a week. How is this fairly balanced. I relied upon these shifts and i had some important decisions that this extra$ 3000 for 6 weeks would help me out to carry. I feel very sad and depressed. Considering that the boss would always bitch about other staff to me and say that i was his best employee. he didn‚Äôt considered me for these shifts and he himself assumed that i was in no need of extra money. I mainly work here for money i had sacrificed my health staying up at nights and disturbing my biological clock, my eyes have been twitching lately because of lack of sleep, i have gained weight and lost all my social life working night shifts on weekends for 2 years. Please advise TIA"
[CAN-ON] Does Denying a Large Raise Request Poison the Well?,"Is there ever any worry when someone proposes a significant raise that the well, so to speak, is poisoned if that request is denied?For background: I work in a mid-managerial marketing and business development role in a very successful, medium-sized law firm. The role was actually created specifically with me in mind. However, I had just lost my job at a previous firm and, for risk of inadvertently pricing myself out of my own job, I low-balled myself. I think I have since proved the value of my position at my firm, but now feel like it is a drastically underpaid position - making considerably less than a first-year associate.I've done some industry research as to what someone in similar positions across the US makes, but those seem extraordinarily high, especially in light of how the 2 people whom I directly report to (executive non-legal positions) live. If they are making more than the research for my position says, then they certainly don't live like it (not to say that's a bad thing).I'm proposing a raise somewhere in the 50% range of what I'm currently making, which I know is extremely large. I'm worried that that may be out of line with what my managers are making and that they will be worried that such a large raise request (and their rejection, presumably) would indicate my level of dissatisfaction there. To be clear, I'm very happy here from a cultural and work standpoint. I just think my value to the firm, in billable time generated, is significantly more than what I am currently being paid, according to my estimates."
Mother in law 6 months to live FMLA [NC],"The policy at my job states that I can use FMLA for care of a family member including my spouses mother. Pretty much I've been supporting my wife since we just got news that my MIL has 6 months to live due to a heart condition. I was only going to take a day of PTO, however my pto is high,  about 3.5% so my supervisor suggested fmla for the week. I'm wondering what would be the care that I would be offering to my family member. I've been taking my spouse to see her mother, watching our child so that she can see her, as she's in the hospital. I don't want to be denied FMLA for not actually having a specific ""care"" that I'm offering. Can anyone shed some light on this?"
[MT] Seeking advice - co-worker continues to come to work contagious,"I‚Äôm seeking guidance on behalf of a family member who is not on reddit. They work at a small company (approx. 50 employees) and one person consistently comes to work with contagious illnesses (colds, flu, stomach, flu, even COVID). The company does have a policy that encourages employee to stay home when they‚Äôre sick, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be enforced ‚Äì or at least not for this person, who seems to buck at authority and just comes to work anyway. My family member has not been with the company long enough to earn sick leave or paid time off. So whenever they get sick and have to stay home, that‚Äôs unpaid time. Additionally, their spouse has an autoimmune disorder, which places them at risk for more significant symptoms, particularly when it pertains to upper respiratory viruses. Since starting at this company, my family member has ben sick 6x as a result of this person coming into work sick. They missed an entire week of work (and wages) in early September, due to this co-worker coming to work with COVID and passing it around the office. At that time, the co-worker was given a ‚Äútalking to‚Äù about not being at work when sick. But over the past two weeks, that person has repeatedly come into work with a stomach flu-like virus (GI distress, diarrhea, vomiting) and my relative finally caught it. And, again, had to take unpaid time off to recover.Staying away from this person is not an option. They share an office area and the co-worker is one of those toxic people that ‚Äúallows‚Äù their stuff to ‚Äúbleed over‚Äù to my relative‚Äôs work area, is always breathing down their neck, looking over their shoulder to see what they‚Äôre doing, etc. My relative is trying to find a different job, but wants to minimize the damage (financial and health wise) while in this process. They also have a concern about not giving an opening for the manager to say she‚Äôs been blindsided by my relative‚Äôs decision to seek work elsewhere. How should they approach their manager, knowing that this will be a repeat complaint?Is there a better way to make a complaint and request that this co-worker be made to stay home when they have a communicable disease? Does it go too far to ask that this co-worker be moved elsewhere, so that if they come to work sick, my relative is not being so constantly and directly exposed to it? My relative cannot be moved, because they work in a front desk/reception capacity and have to be where they‚Äôre currently stationed. What about asking for the ability to work from home when the co-worker is sick, so that if they choose to come to work while infections, at least my relative can protect themselves? These are all ideas that I have been discussing with them, but we‚Äôre not sure how to best introduce them, or how to best approach the manager, regarding these concerns?"
[CA] Is it appropriate for my workplace to have my sister be the one to request me to come into work or stay longer when someone calls out?,"I (19F) and my sister S (21F) both work for a Safeway/Albertsons company grocery store in the southern California district. I‚Äôve worked there for about 7 months now and my sister a little over a year.About 2 months in they started having S personally call me on her phone to see if i can come in to cover a shift or approach me to ask if I can stay longer. I asked S why they have her do this, she claims that our supervisors told her that they don‚Äôt have my cell phone number on file. I know this is false because our bookkeeper and a supervisor has called me into work several times from the store phone. I even came to one of the supervisors and gave them my phone number again just in case. Despite that, the problem still persists.I heard some negative things about the store‚Äôs management from job application websites, and I was hearing from S that people would get frustrated with the poor management and leave after a month or two. I do admit that I‚Äôve had my fair share of poor service from my own management and have been searching for jobs to leave this one for.EDIT: Yes, I have previously told my supervisors that I would prefer if they did not do this, as they are making my sister take time out of her work to do something that they could easily do.Is it inappropriate that my supervisors do this?"
[CA] My Boss Goes Shirtless At Work And Takes Ice Baths Here,"Is this allowed/legal?I work at an extremely small company, whose employees are technically not even employees, and are paid as 1099 independent contractors. There are usually 5 or 6 employees working every day. The business is also ran out of a residential area, in a house converted into a recording studio. Both the 1099 employee situation and residential business may not be legal, but my specific question is about the shirtlessness.My boss has lately gotten into the new trend of ‚Äúice bathing‚Äù, where you sit inside tub of ice water for like 5min at a time to improve your immune system. He has installed an ice bath at our workplace, and is regularly seen shirtless with a bathing suit by both male and female workers.Today, he has brought a friend with him and they are both taking turns in the ice bath, both shirtless. They are also using the employee bathroom to shower before and after.Is this ok? Is this legal? Is this indecent exposure? Or have we forfeited a right to complain by working as independent contractors at a residence?I‚Äôve never really worked in traditional work environments so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs normal, legal or acceptable.Thanks for any insight or help!"
[IL] Museum Department Director Reaches out,"I was offered a position at a very well known nationally accredited museum. We are in the negotiation faze and I was offered well below what HR got back to me with. After I told the recruiter I would be comfortable with 3k more than my initial offer (the max of the listed salary range). I did some research and realized that I'm leaving so much money on the table, so I want to re-ask today for 5k-10k more than the max for the position. There also isn't any savings in place in the offer I received (I asked about this and how it can be implemented or if they have discarded this from their packages), I've read about some horror stories of people's offers being rescinded just because they asked for a living wage and am afraid of that outcome, what should I do? The Director of the department emailed me this morning too instead of the recruiter to talk if I wanted to. Is this a good or a bad sign? I really want this job, but I don't want to be struggling because of inflation, rising costs of living, or this recession we're in. I do think they really want me to join, I want to keep the offer on the table though.Edit: I did accept the offer with the initial ask which was for the full range offered. Thanks so much for everyone's help!"

[TX] Upfront costs for new job. Not sure if this standard,"I am about to close on a new job that I‚Äôm really excited for. The CEO & people seem great, it‚Äôs $20k more in salary but requires a relocation to TX and to be in office. The relocation budget ($15k) isn‚Äôt dispensed until I acquire an address and utility bill in the new city. Leading up to that, I‚Äôd have pay to fly myself out to the office and for lodging while I look for a place and work at the office. Basically, the upfront costs are fairly significant. I‚Äôve been at the same employer for a decade and am struggling to understand if this standard, or too risky? Everything else about the role and company checks out.

[NJ] Boss said something really racist in my 1-1 meeting yesterday. It is really really pissing me off.,"So  I had a meeting with my boss yesterday. He was berating me for some  slack message I sent out. I sent out a message saying ""I will let my  colleague continue this conversation. I am just helping her. I have some  work to do."" He was berating me because I said I have some work to do.I  don't know why I said that this, but I said that I saw people get into  shouting matches at my previous company and none of them were fired. I  made this up. Nobody at my previous company had any shouting matches or  anything. I don't know why I said this. At this point he gets really  riled up. And says ""We don't do that stuff in America. Maybe they do  that stuff in those Asiatic countries. Maybe they do that stuff in the  Bangalore office. But here in America we don't do that stuff"". I am an  Indian and I have been living in America for 7 years now. Surprisingly  this is the first time someone said anything racist to me. My boss is  an Asian too, but not an Indian.His  behavior is really really pissing me off. I can ignore the rest of the  shit that he said, but this thing that he said really really hurt me.  His behavior is effecting my work performance too. Now the problem is  that he said what he said in a meeting, verbally. Can I complain to the  HR about his behavior? I can't switch jobs right now because of  Recession.Edit 1: I have only worked 1 full time job before this job. That job was in America. My boss knows where I have worked. I think we discussed how the build system works in my previous job atleast 50 to 60 times. We discussed at length the pros and cons of static linking as was done at my previous job. There is absolutely no chance that my boss doesn't know where I have previously worked.  Even when I corrected him and told him that my previous job was in New York, his response was that New York is different and doesn't really reflect American work culture.Edit 2: I was helping my colleague by posting on behalf of her in a public Slack channel. I have tagged her atleast 2 times in comments. People were asking me questions in that channel about her project that I was not able to answer, so I said ""I will let her lead the conversation. I am just helping her. I have some work to do."""

The CEO went on about how she loved my experience, thought I was the perfect fit etc.I emailed to follow up on a written offer and the recruiter asked if I‚Äôd be open to an offer $30k less than the verbal offer with a reduced title because ‚Äúthe team has a concern regarding your salary expectations given your overall number of years of experience‚ÄùI plan to decline of course, but what gives?

Does an employer need to pay out 2 week notice after telling employee not to come in once notice was received? [CAN-ON],"My wife was the Baker at a local cafe, she gave her two weeks notice last weekend and her boss showed up at our door within an hour to berate her and take their key back. Her boss gave her a 15minute speech about how giving her 2 weeks notice was not fair since they have 3 small kids and that this is a small town so word will get around and impact the business my wife is trying to grow for herself. They said they don't want her to work another shift for them.The husband of this boss then proceeded to text my wife the next day with 7 paragraphs of shit talking down to her and saying she should have provided multiple months of notice.These people are very shady business operators who like to skirt regular rules (such as not paying their staff for stat days) and manipulate the staff. Which is funny since their day jobs are as a cop and the other is in the military.My wife hasn't heard yet on whether they will be paying her out for these final 2 weeks.Is there any guidance that anyone can provide?They intimidate her with the way they talk and will likely try to not pay her the final 2 weeks so I wanted to see what her options would beShe has been employed by them since Def 2022 if that means anything and her employment contract dictated a 2 week notice would be mandatory (for which she provided)Side note, she also completely created the menu for baked goods and has shared these recipes with them thru a Google doc for which she is the document owner. They have requested ownership of the doc, does she need to give it to them? Her employment contract was a very standard one and was not specific for a baker (she was the only baker they've ever had, she has the same employment contract as the baristas)."

[MN] Director making Uncomfortable comments about my upcoming Maternity leave,"My site director has been making uncomfortable comments concerning my upcoming maternity leave. Here are some examples of the comments:""You can just hold that kid in until that's done right?"" ""Don't have that baby too early, we need that done by the end of the year."" "" I'm sure she will just answer calls when she's gone.""There have been more but they are basically all along these lines, and I unfortunately haven't been documenting the frequency of comments, or exact wording.I have given the feedback to my manager, who reports to our site director,  that these comments are making me uncomfortable and that I don't feel supported in trying to figure out a plan to either resolve my projects or come up with an alternative plan if I can't finish them due to mother nature's timeline. His response was to schedule a meeting to come up with a plan and to assure me that site director is only joking.My questions:  How should I respond next? Should I file a complaint with HR because it feels like my concerns are being side stepped and im still uncomfortable? Do I have a legitimate complaint to file with HR?"
[CA]Do I have any right to be upset at my manager/coworkers? struggling with RA,"So I work at a grocery store overnight and do stocking, was recently promoted to a key Carrier. About a year ago I started having severe foot pain to the point I couldn't walk and would limp around because I wouldn't want to call in and have them do more work. Well I have the hardest set (aisles) as they are canned items and juice which is rather heavy for myself especially this time of year. I was told when I first came to this store this set was temporary because I was taking over for someone who was on medical leave and as soon as he returned he would take it back and I would become a ""floater"". They apparently really liked the way I did it and decided to keep me on it. Okay cool, no worries. Well my foot pain got to where I could no longer handle it and my podiatrist suggested I take off some time (just a few days mind you), so I asked for a couple days but was refused. After a couple weeks my tendon (posterior tibial to be exact) ended up nearly tearing. So she took me out on disability no ifs ands or butt's for 6 weeks. Well all that time while that foot (left) was hurting I was putting my weight on my right foot. And developed plantar fasciitis in my right foot. So now both feet are screwed.  Anyway, I came back from disability and that night they ordered extremely heavy for me and ended up not helping. So that morning my feet were so swollen I couldn't fit in my shoes. I had to call in that next night and ended up in a soft cast. I asked the store manager for an easier set, something for me to settle into and work my way up again. Like they did for the coworker I was covering for to begin with. But he said no, he likes things how they are. So I kinda just sucked it up and didn't want to cause drama. Fast forward to now, I was again in severe pain but damn near everywhere and was finally just diagnosed with RA. Was put on leave for 3 months to begin taking medication to make sure it adjusts with me since the last medication had me in the ER. My first night back was last night, and again they ordered EXTREMELY heavy (they purposely ordered small while I was gone only to order big to have me refill it) with no helping me again and I managed to limp my way around. So now my knees, feet and shins are swollen. If I were to ask again for my set (aisles) to be changed, do I have any right? Or is that me not being able to perform my job? I'm kinda confused and just scared honestly. I've been with this company 10 years and just now dealing with this disease is new and learning how to work with it is terrifying for me. This job is kinda all I know at this point in my life unfortunately. My managers for whatever reason won't work with me, but maybe they don't have to and that's why.

I've asked HR when the information about insurance products will be available and have been advised that more information will be released next week.I've always worked for companies that provided information two to three weeks ahead of open enrollment. This seems a wee bit late. Does anyone know if the US government has any regulations as to when companies must release information about insurance products ahead of open enrollment?
[NY] How to use 160 sick days?,"How to use 160 sick days? My workplace union provides very good medical, annual, and sick time?

[UT] Anxiety attack during a meeting. Should I speak up?,"I was having a meeting with my CFO and a few other executives to go over a large project I had been working on.

[FL] Tuition Reimbursement Repayment,Are there any laws regarding employer provided wage advances that require repayment within 12 months? I recently left an employer and owe them $3889 for a tuition reimbursement program I participated in.

I‚Äôve asked them to identify what law this is and have not received an answer.
[NY] Why is religious background not taken into account of a company's diversity goal?,"I am applying for jobs in the USA and noticed that every single one asks (and sometimes requires) my...RaceGenderVeteran StatusDisability StatusNever do they ask for my religious background, which I'd think is a key ingredient to having a diverse workforce... imagine a company with equal race and genders, but they're all the same religion (let's say Christianity)... a jew (0.2% of world population) would be very excluded from this workforce..."

[KY]Is this allowed?,"Over 2 months ago i requested time off. Specifically from Oct. 20-Nov.6. October 19 would be my last working day and November 7 would be my first working day back.

"[CA] Does ""#LI-RemoteCalifornia"" mean that this job is only remote for people in CA?",I see jobs that say for example  #LI-Remotestate.  I assume when ever it mentions the state that its only for people living there? Or basically the hours to be worked are for that time zone?

[MN] Will getting something in writing help me?,I'll be getting a  promotion as a Department Lead soon.

[FR] Why interviewers ask for the names of other companies you are interviewing with ?,"I had this question during interviews so many times and it just annoys me so much because I don't know the motive behind it and I always imagine it's a bad one.I'm not talking about companies in general asking if you have other processes, that is completely understandable. I don't even mind if they ask generally about the sector of the other companies you are interviewing with. But often they ask this and then they ask ""What is the name of the company""?I see literally 0 good reason to ask this question other than a bad one. But I don't want to jump to conlusions so do you have any ideas ?"
[UK] is it ok to resign 8 months after taking a 6 month unpaid sabbatical,When I plan on resigning it will be 2 years since I asked for a sabbatical. It will be 8 months since I returned from my 6 month sabbatical. I have been at the company 7 years.I like the company I work for however I‚Äôve stagnated in career progression and I could earn a lot more as a freelancer. I would plan on hopefully freelancing at my current job (not right away of course) as it something a lot of people do in my industry. Therefore I don‚Äôt want to leave my employer with a bad taste and not hire me again.I get on well with my manager however I did get in trouble for working on my sabbatical - it was a misunderstanding and in the end no action was taken against me.Will they resent me for leaving after only being back 8 months?Thanks
"[MN] Have a reasonable accommodation that is approved, but have a specific question","I applied for and was approved for a reasonable accommodation through my HR office. I have had intermittent FMLA for migraine flare ups for years. Within the last year I applied for a reasonable accommodation (not being required to travel more than 50 miles per day for work and also not being required to work past a certain number of hours per week).My workplace has tons of employees so my accommodation does not have a huge problematic affect. With that said my accommodation was not signed off/approved using the same verbiage as my request. I had stated not to be required to travel more than 50 miles per day. My neurologist went a little above and beyond and in the reasonable accommodation request wrote ""... no travel required more than 50 miles from work site ..."". My HR department then wrote in the reasonable accommodation approval ""no travel 50 miles from work site."" I figured just leave it and not bother saying to change it to what I wrote (no more than 50 miles travel per day) because either works for my situation, even though I believe it is somewhat overkill.I am able to travel 100 miles in less than 24 hours - just need to take breaks. I have a lot of people, including my HR boss and my other bosses on social media. Could I even remotely get in trouble if I was to travel say 100 miles away and post on social media? For some reason I think I would because my accommodation says no traveling 50 miles from work site. My friend told me I am overthinking this, and that my workplace accommodation only is for when I am at work and I am free to travel 200, 300 or more miles a day on my off days.I then responded with ""maybe you are right, but maybe you are wrong. . . Since I have a restriction on the number of hours I can be forced to work, that would mean I cannot get a second job, correct?"" On that question they were a little more hesitant to say yes or no.So HR experts, am I free to travel and post on social media on my off days if I got above the travel restriction of what my HR boss approved? Nowhere in the travel restriction does it say anything about what I do on my time off, this is implied, in my opinion, only relating to my work hours.To be specific, if I travel more than 50 miles in a single nonstop sitting I about 75% of the time get a migraine. If I take a long break, I can travel another 50 miles. This is why in the original request I put this. It was my HR person who slapped on the no travel 50 miles from work site.My other friend disagreed with my one friend and I and said I could absolutely get in trouble if I was to post a pic of me even 51 miles away..."
[FL] does my boss like me or it‚Äôs all in my head,"Okay so this all started happening when i got this new job a few months ago. my boss is an attractive man that easily are a lot of girls type. when i first started i was more to myself so I wouldn‚Äôt engage in any kind of flirting with anyone because I wanted to make a good impression first. I never thought anything of it at all but then I slowly started realizing my boss would always say hi to me when I walked into work and would stare me down mainly my eyes. mind you we work with 100+ employees( he doesn‚Äôt say hi to everyone like this). he‚Äôll always just stare at me and smile, he‚Äôll mess with me and joke around saying stupid work related stuff, he‚Äôll come up to me and tell me I‚Äôm such a hard worker. He‚Äôll also just touch my arm or shoulder really gently when I‚Äôm not looking to let me know he‚Äôs saying hi to me if he hasn‚Äôt had the chance to. I always wear my hair down at work literally every day since I started. I put my hair in a bun recently because I got really hot and I noticed he kept staring ( he‚Äôs also never gave me any compliments that are inappropriate, just very innocent compliments.) but then he finally tells me when we are next to each other that he‚Äôs loving the new look and smirks at me. he is very friendly to everyone there but in my gut I feel something different especially with the tension we have any time we speak to each other. He‚Äôs definitely not obsessive or always worried about me but just when he has time he‚Äôll make it fun. He doesn‚Äôt really stare and gaze at me if we are working in different areas only sometimes but mostly when we walk past each other he‚Äôll just make a little joke or stare in my eyes and smile. the main thing for me that I just want to know is if the touching means something because he does not do that with everybody at all. He‚Äôll also wait for my reaction but it‚Äôs very very innocent the touch"

[NY] Background Check (NYC),"Hi everyone. I've been on reddit for many years (under a different name) and posting under this new username for personal reasons. I'm truly ashamed and embarrassed to ask this. So, I hope I can get some sincere advice from professionals on this sub reddit without any backlash or anything.I've been employed in the accounting profession for the last decade. Unfortunately, due to a parent's illness, and a very rough period in my marriage where spending and budgeting was a major source of conflict and disagreement between my spouse and I, we hit rock bottom and filed a chapter 13 approximately 2.5 years ago. The filing was dismissed 6 months after the filing date. After many years of excellent credit, my credit report looks like an utter mess. Many delinquencies, charge offs, collections and of course, the chapter 13 filing. A few months after the dismissal, my spouse and I came into some money and started settling all of our debts. While I still have about $36k in debt to settle, I am working with all of my creditors to settle these accounts and expect to be done by the end of this year.I've been interviewing with companies for inhouse Controller level positions and am worried sick that once they run my credit, I'll be rejected. I've just completed a second round interview with a company and things are looking promising. I have a family and am just trying to move up a bit and earn more to provide us with better living conditions. I should add that both my spouse and I have worked very hard over the last few years on our issues, and because we were essentially forced to live without credit for some time, we've learned much better money management techniques and work together as a couple when it comes to our finances. We've also been approved for a few credit cards too over the last year and have been using them very responsibly, making on time payments. We are doing really well today in terms of rebuilding positive credit history but until all of the derogatory stuff gets removed, our scores and report will look not good, to say the least. I don't think this matters much but my score is around 629 today, which is a massive improvement from 2.5 years ago.My apologies for the long wall of a post but I'm just wondering if anyone can offer some real world advice. It's embarrassing to me to have filed, and it's been eating away at me for years and will continue to, but even more so in that the field I work in is generally thought to be synonymous with handling finances (while I do check up on account balances, I really don't manage money or deal with it in the way the general masses think in any of my accounting positions). Would greatly appreciate any advice/comments on how to handle this situation like this. Thank you!"
[MI] Mandatory Training,"Michigan Manager wanted to change the processing system out of nowhere. Told everyone there would be mandatory training to go over the changes. Scheduled my training an hour before shift on a day I have prior family commitments. We‚Äôve been on mandatory OT for the last 11 MONTHS (do it where and when you can so long as you hit X number of hours a week), I sincerely cannot miss what I have going on Wednesday and just don‚Äôt feel close enough to or trust this manager enough to go into detail about why I can‚Äôt clock in early that specific day. I‚Äôve been hitting my mandatory ten hours a week, every week, and have never run into this type of problem before (this is also a new manager that just started <6 months ago whereas I‚Äôve been here for 7 years). I offered alternatives of after my shift started that day or early on one of the next two days after that because I‚Äôll be available but I was still threatened with a write up if I do not participate. What gives?? Do I have an obligation to tell her specifics about every second of my day or is a family commitment more than enough because it‚Äôs outside of my scheduled working hours? I feel like it‚Äôs just another petty threat but this is turning into a consistent thing so I‚Äôm about to quit my job over it and need opinions."

[PA] Hostile Coworker What to do?,"I started a new job It is the same company but in a different building. Before I started someone Facebook messages me and wanted to welcome me to the job. She said she cleaned out some drawers for me etc. She said she was that we will be equals and that neither one of us is each others bosses and we are to work as a team. And that she applied for the job but didn't get only because I was there longer. I thanked her and didn't respond anymore. I started and the first few days were fine other than her being a little bossy. Then one day the person training me couldn't come in that day. So this coworker that Facebook messages me had to train me. I did a check on a material and it came out bad. She told me to add water to it. I did that and she messages Quality Control at the other building to explain what happened. The person came over had to quarantine my material. I guess the water made the situation worse. But nobody blamed me. They were blaming her for it. The next day she calls off. The following day she was being passive aggressive and kept telling me she won't be doing all the Shit Jobs etc. That I wasn't her boss. So, I emailed the plant manager and had him talk to us. He said that I was her boss. The next day a coworker said that she told her I was pluging my ears and wouldn't talk to her. Making stuff up.Then today she was talking to someone while the 3 of us were working. She wasn't talking to me and it wasn't about anything important. I  walked away to grab something I needed. She came up to me and said I was being rude because I walked away. I said you weren't even talking to me. She said she's not putting up with this. I said I'm not arguing and walked away and told someone in Management. Management asked each of us privately what happened wrote down what I said. And said they needed to talk to upper management and will get back to us. What should I do at this point?"
[CAN] Errors in employment contract,"Hello, this is my first post on reddit.Recently I got an offer from a big accounting firm. I need to sign the contract using Docusign.

[DC] HR reply to green card sponsorship: We will look into this later. How to move discuss this further to lead to a more definitive / positive response?,"Hi everyone,I have been working at this company for almost 3 years now, being on H-1B visa since last year. Today, I asked someone at HR for green card sponsorship and they said that they will look into it at a later time since I have plenty of time left on my visa.I am not entirely sure on how to make HR look into this matter faster and with more significance. Should I tell that about how long the PERM process takes and that I have already been working for a number of years with them? Should I mention my good performance reviews?I am flying out of the country and getting my H-1B visa stamped in the next 2 weeks. Hence, I don't want to push them so much that they lay me off? Is that even possible / legal?I would love to hear from someone who has had similar experience. Thank you so much! :)"

Is it likely my job offer will be refunded due to debt? [MA],"Hi everyone! I'm hoping/wondering if anyone has any knowledge about credit checks and how HR uses them to determine if an offer would be rescinded. I've iust been offered a new iob in Finance but due to a mvriad of factors have $27k in credit card debt...typing that makes me feel ill. I've never missed payments or anything like that, but I'm scared that when HR pulls my credit they could refund the offer. Does this seem like something that might be likely? Also worth noting I've got a car loan and personal loan. But does just being in debt send up enough red flags for them to refund the offer?"
[UK] should I get bank holidays back in lieu if I‚Äôm on emergency standby on the day?,"Employed in England. Bank holidays make up part of my holiday entitlement (20 days + bank holidays).As part of my job I do out of hours emergency callout for a week at a time. We get paid a retainer for being on stand-by for the week then time and half / double time on top if we get called depending of time of day. This in itself I have no issue with and quite enjoy it if anything however I am butting heads with my employer over what happens if i‚Äôm on call over a bank holiday. Being on call is restrictive - I have to be ready to respond whenever I‚Äôm called meaning I cannot go too far from home/my area, I cannot go for a long walks or bike ride, drink, go out to dinner etc.So bearing that in mind, in the event I‚Äôm on standby over a bank holiday, I cannot do as I please due to work commitment/requirements and so I‚Äôm my opinion regardless of whether I get called out on said bank holiday, I am still technically working and should either have the day paid as a regular work day or get the day back in lieu. My employer on the other hand claims I am not working and should not get the day back in lieu as call-outs are ‚Äòunscheduled‚Äô works and so do not apply to the normal working time directive.Keen to hear what your opinions on the matter is. I can‚Äôt find too much info online about this."

I admit I‚Äôm not savvy with business approaches and I should have asked for more starting, but now it feels like I‚Äôm too new to really try again now.Should I maybe wait til the end of the year to bring anything up? Should I bring anything up at all? If I were to ask for one, what pay should I be shooting for?

[MA]started a new job and given the wrong salary contract to sign,"Hi! I am looking for some guidance in addressing an error HR made when signing onto a new position. In my interview I was told my salary range would be categorized under a specific step as it is a union protected position. I wanted to negotiate my salary, but when I received my offer letter it stated my salary was going to be higher- so I did not feel the need to pursue negotiations.When I was formally put into the onboarding system after my letter was signed and returned to HR I noticed that my salary was listed as a lower step. I immediately reached out to HR and that‚Äôs when I was informed that they made an error and sent me the wrong salary.I have still not received a new contract or signed anything that states that I am on a lower salary step, but I am being paid the lower amount.I asked to negotiate at this point, but was told that I could not. I am wondering if there‚Äôs any law or argument specific to HR‚Äôs error where I can advocate for the contract I signed and what I expected to be paid?"
[NL] Final interview for significantly higher position,"I applied for a position within my company (but different country) and this week I have a final round of interviews with the local ExCom.It‚Äôs a senior HR role and based on the discussions exceptionally demanding, working with very high rank managers (all male) who have high rank attitudes. Throughout the interview process it was made clear to me that even though they see a great potential in me, they have reservations about my rather young age (F31) and therefore the level of respect I would be able to get from the stakeholders.Any tips on convincing them that I can handle the pressure and build mutually respectful relationships? I will be very thankful."
May need to take short term leave to care for my Husband but my Employer doesn't qualify for FMLA. How do I make sure I don't lose my position? [KS],"Located in Kansas. My(f35) husband(36) was diagnosed with Heart failure this spring. While the meds and life style changes have improved his condition, he is still struggling on a daily basis. Last week they scheduled his first heart surgery. While the surgery should be simple his recovery, estimated 2-3 weeks, will be rough and I may need to stay home to care for him and our 3yo son. Unfortunately we don't make enough for or qualify for in home care.My husband is a contract worker for a small company and his leave will be unpaid. I am currently the bread winner and our health insurance is through my employer. I only have 35hrs of PTO left and I don't want to use it up, in case I need it at a later date. He has no short term disability insurance, and mine won't cover him or me for his illness. My employer has less than 50 employees which means I won't qualify for FMLA protection.What is my best course of action? How do I care for my husband without losing my job?"

[TN] Need help wording an email to boss about working outside my availability,"As vague as I can be for security purposes, where I work is very short staffed and the next 3 months we have after hours events that need extra staffing. My boss and my bosses boss work very closely with the whole department. I am a fairly new employee (less than a month) and when I interviewed with HR and my bosses boss we all agreed that I would be part time and only work certain days. Now I work the event hours and regular shifts on the days I've agreed to work no problem. Now my boss is telling me that I need to help cover more shifts because they're so short staffed and mentioned that his boss is pressuring him to make events mandatory and schedule whoever and whenever they need the help. Now obviously this presents a problem for me. I want to address this as an email to my boss and cc my bosses boss. How do I kindly word that I can only work my availability and that's all I can do? I don't want to come off as unhelpful, or picky, or demanding. I just want to not be pressured to work more than I'm able to."

I‚Äôm the only person who can do some of the work I do in the department and I‚Äôm fairly certain they would try to work it out with me.How do I bring this up to my current employer to see if they can do something for me so I stay? I already know what it would take to get me to stay; a $1 raise and the ability to work 1 day a week in the office without transitioning to the 2 days a week they‚Äôre planning in the future OR a $2 raise even if I have to go in twice a week.

I posted wrong location tag on purpose as I know my manager and colleagues lurk here sometimes.So laws here are very different I assume.What I'm actually asking is not from the legal aspects but from proper behavior methods.I started to work in a store about 2 months ago after a long period of unemployment. I also have a slight mental disability.I earn minimum wage by hourly rating, no monthly pay.Since started working there I saw many ""red lights"" alarming me about the Manager's behavior.Please advise what to do?Very often work hours are from early morning or up to late night. In which buses are not available to get me home. As a result I had to take a taxi at my own expanse a few times and even walk for almost 2 hours by foot several times when taxis weren't available. Taxi drive home costs more than I earn daily so doesn't make sense for me. The manager is obligated to pay for transportation but only cover bus rides."

Wrong salary in contract? [SE],"Hi,I applied for a principal role which was above my experience level, with appertained salary expectation range of 960-1020 000 per annum.I did very well in the interview process and they decided to give me an offer. However, ""as not to rock the boat‚Äù in the company/team with older people having the principal role I was given the title of senior.I will have the same responsibilities as in the principal role, but the recruiter told me that this would lead to a lower salary, 750 000 per annum. I accepted it as I think the company and position is a great fit for me.Now they sent me the contract for me to sign and it suddenly states a salary of 990 000 per annum, matching my salary expectation of the initial role. Keep in mind that it took them quite some time sending me this contract since ""it had to be verified by the HR director"". The tile stated in the contract was the senior role and not the principal role, so they at least changed that.Should I ask them what happened here, or just wait it out until I get the first salary?Could the recruiter have been mistaken or did the HR people mess up?"

I already have a offer letter and I did not talk about the signon/joining bonus because I was under impression that I would get it from my current employer. Please suggest."
[CA] HR is enforcing a buddy system when leaving work but my buddy makes me wait too long,My company is big but my department consists of 8 people. We are located in a different area than our main company so it‚Äôs just us in our corporate office environment. There was a creepy guy who kept hanging out in our parking lot watching us come and go and my coworkers and I told our manager who told HR. We were told to enforce the buddy system and not be at work alone and if you‚Äôre not finished with working by the end of your day you can take the work home and continue it. Most people have a earlier clock out time so it doesn‚Äôt affect them. But another coworker and I are the last to leave so naturally when its my clock out time I want to go home. Last week there was a day where I was standing waiting to clock out and my coworker who im supposed to clock out with made me wait 20 minutes until she was done sending emails so we could both leave together. How do I tell my manager in a nice way that I just want to leave when my shift is over and not feel tied to someone else. I can‚Äôt keep waiting on my coworker.
[NY] Wife experiencing direct and indirect racism in the work place,Wifes boss is an extreme racist and believe is superior to all and above any rules. Some examples of his racism would be us living in a very mixed neighborhood and getting a response like ‚Äúi heard they like to eat alot of watermelon in that area‚Äù. Will drop racial slurs frequently as well. My wife is 90% Nigerian I would say but the boss believes she is soley Hispanic. None the less this behavior is wrong and disgusting and want to know if any action could be taken. Hes said way worse but id rather not say that here. Infront of his clients as well. My wife is extremely uncomfortable going to work lately due to the increase in this behavior.
"[MA] I-9, incorrect name on SSN","Hello!I have an I-9 I will need to fill out eventually but just had a question,I got my name changed legally through naturalization last year but I lost the original copy and the name change document which are needed to change my name on my SSN.Luckily I filed for a new passport before I lost those so I have a passport with my correct legal name that matches my application details.I was wondering if an incorrect name on my SSN will affect my I-9 even if I use my updated passport for my document? Thank you!"
[WA] Employer only showing one hour per day at day rate,"Hey guys, I say the post from the guy getting hundreds of hours at $1 per hour and it reminded me to ask you guys about my payroll situation, the yin to that poster‚Äôs yang I guess.I work on contract offshore, and get paid a day rate while at work.  Company has set it up so that payroll(paylocity) shows 1 hr/day and that hour is paid at our full day rate. I already can see issues with taking unemployment since it would be 100% not possible to fill the 680 hrs/year requirement; is this something the company would be able to correct by contacting UI?  Any other potential pitfalls I‚Äôm not seeing or good reasons why they would want it set up this way?Thanks for everything y‚Äôall do, I appreciate ya"
[IN] Can my employer decrease my hourly rate for a decrease in scheduled hours?,"I get paid $20/hour for working 40 hours/week. If I reduce my hours by 20% and I work 32 hours/week, can my employer decrease my hourly rate by 20% as well?If the above is the practice that a company follows, do you think someone going from 32 hours to 40 hours should get a 20% increase in the rate?"
"[CAN] - old role, new responsibility, new pay?","I have more than 5years of experience and I have my CPA.

[CA] employer deducting $$ from salaried employees,"I just started at a new company and recently found out that they deduct money from salaried employees who are under their monthly minimum client hours. If an employee is under their monthly minimum, it is usually due to cancelations, etc. it is not the employees doing (like missing appointments). This feels highly illegal to me and I‚Äôm curious to know an outsiders opinion."
[UK] Is this bullying?,"I have this coworker who makes jokes at every word I say. (I‚Äôm a grade higher to him at the job but he is older than me). I‚Äôm more qualified but he suggests me I should learn more do some certifications so I‚Äôll be an expert. He tells other coworkers that I keep all my knowledge secrete (I have taken many sessions to share whatever work I do with them)It took me a long time to understand that he is taking jabs at me (I‚Äôm autistic and don‚Äôt get social clues sometime, I have not disclosed this at work). I have had enough and told my boss that he‚Äôs behaviour it‚Äôs affecting my work and my boss reacted positively in the beginning he said if he does that again let me know and I‚Äôll take strict action against him.But in next meeting my boss brought up this conversation and told me to not take him seriously he‚Äôs just having some fun he isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúmonster‚Äù I think he is. For sometime he had stopped the bullying behaviour but now he has started this again. Everything I say in a meeting there comes a joke flying out of nowhere. And I don‚Äôt know how to react to that I just freeze and don‚Äôt say anything no one says anything laugh it off. But after that I feel so angry and agitated. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this?Everyone else treat me with respect and I have done some great work at this place my salary is higher than this guy and I think why I should be the one to be looking for other job and not him?What should I do in this scenario? Is there a way I can stop treating me like this?"
[TX] How can parental leave be used?,Current DoD federal employee that has signed agreement with my supervisor and agency to use 12 weeks of paid parental leave intermittently after our child was born. We have another toddler that normally receives care so my spouse is able to provide full care to our newborn.  We are planning to travel as a family and I‚Äôd like to use parental to care for our infant as my wife will be busy and need to provide attention to our toddler. My supervisor is questioning my use of parental leave for this reason and is under the impression. When I mentioned travel he said parental leave should only be used for doctors appointments and for our newborn to receive medical care. I tried asking my HR department and they said they would need to verify. I did a quick search and found eCFR 630.1203 subpart L (i) and how it generally states it used to care for the newborn and also for bonding. Can anyone provide additional context on this? Should parental leave be taken strictly for medical appointments and do I need to provide such detailed information to my supervisor each time I wish to take parental leave?
[CAN] bad credit score,"Hi, I just missed two credit card payments of under 100 dollars because I thought I set up auto payment.

Is that overdue gonna destroy everything?"
[CA] questions about post offer background check?,"So I signed my offer letter, got my company laptop sent to me, I have created all my accounts on company systems and I just received a background check email.So background check companies compare the application candidates fill out on their site vs the resume the candidate sent in when they first applied for the job? I messed up on some dates on my resume by a few months, but double checked before filling out the background check and used the accurate info for that. Also, when filling out the application, are candidates supposed to give the prior employments supervisor contact information or the business contact information?"
[FL] Co-worker is stalking me/trying to get me fired,"I have a co-worker that started late 2021, he asked me out after he was there for about 2 weeks. I declined.Here is the backstory to the current situation:Fast forward to March 2022, I was injured badly at work, and need surgery. In late April the doctor evaluated me and decided it was too dangerous for me to drive. So from May until now I've been stuck at home (my manager decided my position isn't a work from home position) on what feels like house arrest. In this time I've been trying not to lose my sanity, and went on vacation at the beginning of the month. This is the same vacation I take every year (for the last 6 years) with my mom, and we go volunteer for 5 days and vacation the rest. I called my adjuster at the beginning of August to make sure it was okay for me to go.After 2 weeks of calling and leaving messages, which were never returned, I just asked another adjuster I managed to get on the phone. She said it would be fine as long as I don't miss any appointments, and I follow my restrictions. She notated it in my file and requested I get a call back. A week later, still no call from my assigned adjuster. So I call again, and ask the same questions, and get the same answer. Don't miss appointments, and don't break restrictions. Again no call back. I had another Dr. appointment, talked to him about the vacation, he gave me better pain meds, and wanted me to get a cortisone shot, which I can't schedule, my adjuster has to. This was mid September, it's now October 16, I went on the vacation and still no call about by shot. UGHNow for my coworker, who we will call Steve. After I was told by the doctor I can't drive (originally it was no driving or even riding in a vehicle, but the would mean I couldn't even get a ride to appointments, so that was removed) and was stuck at home, Steve began stalking me. I was warned by some of my employees and other coworkers, in addition, they also told me that Steve had begun making lewd comments about me. I asked them to report it, but with our reporting system the complaint is recorded and the person whom the complaint is about is allowed to listen to the audio, this makes it easy to figure out who made the complaint. Even though retaliation is not allowed, I've observed Steve berating employees, and making threats, and not being coached or disciplined.Anyway, I would post old pictures of me running (captioned as such and some were even reposts from 3 years ago) and mention how I missed running or hiking or whatever activity was in the picture. Posting was an outlet, and I got a lot of positive comments from friends and others who had the same injury and the process they had to go through. I also got suggestions about how to help manage the pain, or activities I could do that wouldn't aggravate it. So it is very helpful. I have also gotten countless messages asking about an update, and posting was a way to reach everyone concerned. Because I can't drive, sometimes my friends would come get me and take me to the beach to get me out of the house, I'd sometimes go 2-3 weeks without leaving my house, so these beach trips were a huge relief, and I would post a picture. Steve would go out of his way to use a friends social media to save pictures to show my boss, and claim I must be faking because I'm at the beach, and smiling. He bragged to my coworkers about using his friend's social media to get pictures of me.In addition, I finally went on my first vacation in a year, I posted a few pictures of me standing and volunteering or just standing with friends. I had told my boss about the vacation, my bosses boss, and, as mentioned above, tried to do my due diligence with my adjuster. This was not a secret trip by any means. While I was on vacation, my coworker called and said Steve was saying I must be faking because I look happy, and it looked like I lost weight (I haven't, but like everyone else I can be a little vain sometimes and I'm not going to post an unflattering picture) and I must be racing because no way I would just volunteer and not compete. (which this is completely verifiable as the competitor list is released publicly and I'm not on it, plus its a championship event and you have to qualify, even if I was healthy, I am no where close to good enough)  Steve told my coworker that my boss told him to watch out for anything suspicious. I don't know if my boss actually said that, because the coworkers that keep me informed said they never heard anything like that from him, or if it's just Steve saying it to hide the creep factor. But he is borrowing friend's Facebook and Instagram accounts to save all my pictures. I also saw him drive by my house when I was walking back, with my crutches, from checking the mail. I live in a small, closed loop neighborhood, he doesn't live anywhere by me, and there would be no reason for him to be there. I don't know how many times he's driven by my house, but it is creepy. I can't think of any reason for him doing all these things except for me turning him down for a date.I have no idea what to do. My mental health is in the dump, I'm frustrated it's taking this long to get surgery, I'm angry that my boss is allowing or maybe even promoting this behavior, I'm disappointed that they don't understand how awful this is, and I'm scared that this guy knows where I live and I don't know how far he will go. I just want to go back to work and have a purpose. Because of my mobility issues I can't even vacuum, I've passed out from the pain more than once, I'm basically a breathing lump. I also live alone, which is incredibly scary. One of the times I passed out from pain and fell on a crowbar and woke up in a small pool of blood.I need advice, I am so overwhelmed.Edited to add:When I was initially told I can't drive, my boss threatened to discipline me if I didn't get a ride from a friend or take an Uber to work. He was educated and told that I can't be told to spend my own money to get to work when my injury is workplace related, and I can't be disciplined for that. I feel like he is resentful because of it though."

[SC] accommodation for an employee with disabled spouse,"Does disability accommodation apply a to the spouse of a disabled person?  We have an employee who has a disabled wife, (the wife works somewhere else not in this company). He comes to work at random hours, sometimes 10 sometimes 12.

[CA] Employer using inaccurate hours to offset inaccurate pay rate.,"I'm new to this community but hope I'm in the right spot. I work on call in addition to my salaried position. My call back (when I am called in to work) rate was mistakenly changed to $1 per hour in the system so my (thousands of employees) employer has simply been using inaccurate hours to offset the inaccurate pay rate to result in accurate pay per pay period. I have asked about it and been assured that there is no problem with this work around. This results in hundreds or thousands of extra ""hours worked"" on a given paycheck. The stub will show my usual 80 hours of salaried work at the usual rate, then hundreds or thousands of extra hours worked over the two-week period at $1/hr. Often far more hours than there are in 2 weeks. I haven't been able to find a concrete reason that this may be a problem down the line but it seems fishy. Social security reporting? Unemployment reporting? Tax reporting? EEOC reporting? Other? I'm in CA. Thanks for any input."
[DC] FICA exemption maintenance,"FICA exemption eligibilityHow are you guys checking on whether individuals on an F1 visa have been here for 5 years or not? is it customary to ask when they begin working for us so we can determine whether or not the employee is eligible for FICA exemption? Our legal counsel just updated and said yes but wondering how logistically others are handling this. Do you guys use a form ? In the USCIS subreddit someone suggested using their opt paperwork but the paperwork doesn‚Äôt necessarily coincide with an individuals entry date.Also, shouldn‚Äôt we also ask for the date that marks their 5 years in the US so we know when to add FICA back on(assuming they are still our employee)?Thanks in advance!"

[NY] Is it possible to get a health insurance enrollment extension?,"I got a new job recently and am not eligible for health insurance just yet. The office had open enrollment for everyone which I didn‚Äôt think applied to me. Apparently it did.HR said they‚Äôd ask ADP to give me an extension.

The calculated amount on the paystub puts the rate at 15/unit.How should I approach my HR/payroll department?

[VA] warning at work,"During my 1:1 with my manager at the end he let me  know that I‚Äôve had about ~3 complaints about how I  communicate with some colleagues. In my whole company there are only two people I work with closely and I‚Äôm assuming it had to be them. He didn‚Äôt give exact examples and said that this isn‚Äôt a write up but a warning.He had to hop off our call but we‚Äôre doing a follow up next week to discuss it more. I can see how I come off this way to some colleagues. I‚Äôm always on the go with my role / driving so I‚Äôll use voice text to respond to messages sometimes and recently we had a big contractual thing hap and I vented to a colleague thinking it was a safe space to do so. I know realise and learned to 1: never do that over slack. 2: colleagues are not your friends.I acknowledge that I need to do better with this and will only reply when I‚Äôm not in a rush and I am at my desk. I do however think that it‚Äôs a misunderstanding as most communication is done through slack and now my colleagues interpret my tone wrong.However, from everyone‚Äôs experience in this subreddit,  can I recover from this?

[NC] Question About Leave and Workplace Harassment,"Content warning for general discussion of trauma, particularly sexual harassment in the workplace.Hello HR pros, I‚Äôm seeking advice regarding a leave of absence situation. I have diagnosed PTSD resulting from a few different traumas, but notably a sexual harassment/assault that occurred a couple of years ago by a colleague. My company‚Äôs HR department was super supportive at the time that I made the report.At this point in time, I‚Äôm finally able to process everything that happened in therapy and I‚Äôm dealing with intense PTSD symptoms. My therapist believes that I need to take a month or more leave from work to focus on getting better while staying away from triggers.So my question has multiple parts:First, should I disclose my PTSD diagnosis to my company? What would be the benefits and drawbacks of this? Are there any accommodations I should ask for aside from time to attend my weekly therapy sessions?Next, if I do take leave, would there be any reason not to let my company know that the reason is due to the harassment/assault I experienced at work? Would this help with approvals, or would it make things more difficult?Finally, is there anything else I‚Äôm overlooking here?Thanks so much in advance."

[OH] Employee constantly threatening with ADA.,"Let me preface with this: Yes, he should be fired. Trust me. I want to. Every day.So, long story short, we have an employee who is making everyone miserable. He went from model employee to a living nightmare. He is using ‚Äúmental health issues‚Äù and ‚Äúchronic illness‚Äù for reasons he‚Äôs like this. Examples, 30+ minute bathroom breaks in addition to his regular breaks, leaving early, being late, and calling out multiple times a week, snapping on other employees and just overall being mean/rude, and then citing the ADA as to why we have to accommodate him and can‚Äôt question him. We‚Äôre a small company with no real HR department and we can‚Äôt really deal with him suing over ADA violations.  We have done everything to make him ‚Äúhappy‚Äù. Let him pick his own schedule, included him on bonuses he didn‚Äôt deserve, help pay for dr bills and therapy, everything. The latest stunt is now changing his address with our payroll app to an out of state address we know he doesn‚Äôt live at and we think it‚Äôs because the taxes are lower in this other state or he‚Äôs trying to revive benefits there as well.Can we ask him to provide proof he moved or that his address changed? Can we even ask for proof of his mental health and physical health issues since he‚Äôs requesting accommodations non stop? Can we get in trouble if he changed the address for fraudulent reasons? Or can we just fire him without an ADA issues?Sorry if these are obvious questions, I just don‚Äôt know."
[PA] Can this be submitted as a case for receiving back pay on a salary increase?,"Myself, as well as some other employees (in a full-time rotational program) recently received a salary increase, but were told we would not be receiving back pay on it since a date had not been given for the raise.

[CT] challenging coworker,"Connecticut challenging coworkerI have a coworker who has been a challenge for me to work with since I started at my job a few years ago. She is  does the same job I do along with a few others, and we work remotely currently. She is very confrontational and goes from 0-10 over nothing, she attempts to give herself the lightest workload possible, refused to help train our new coworker leaving it basically to myself because of staffing issues, and she‚Äôs just a bully. I try to limit talking to her as much as possible but it‚Äôs not completely feasible. She causes dysfunction in the group especially if she feels she doesn‚Äôt want to do something she throws a tantrum. Yesterday while trying to have a conversation about our workload (that I share with her) i requested to make a change on something we were working on editing as a group and changing it around as we do from our manager (normal process we do, she gets upset everytime) and she refused and said she‚Äôd quit first because she just doesn‚Äôt want to split that part or do it at all (it‚Äôs expected we all know how to and are willing to do this part of the assignment). I attempted to stay calm but she continued to escalate and then accused me of saying things I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm done with this situation, problem is that if I talk to my manager I‚Äôm afraid things are going to be much worse. She and another coworker in our group are very cliquish so it‚Äôs them against us kind of thing, but seems mostly focused on me. I don‚Äôt trust her and I don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôll retaliate, I‚Äôm also afraid to risk losing working from home. Any advice is greatly appreciated, my husband says ignore her my friend says talk to my manager. I try to be nice to everyone and I worked well with others in the past."
[IL] Is it bad for me to omit grad date from my resume? I keep being asked about a gap and I‚Äôm tired of it,"I graduated last summer 2021, I didn‚Äôt get a job in my field until 2 months ago. However I am looking to move on to other positions now. I was asked about it yesterday by a recruiter and I was thinking it would stop after I started working but it hasn‚Äôt.

Will the background check company still deliver on the court records even after the employer clear? By clear I meant the employer forcefully went and put the report under court records  as completed. Also do these reports show a person still under probation, but they have a CWOF so it‚Äôs not a conviction. Will this still show ?"
[NC] Waiting a long time to get an offer‚Ä¶,"I am in a very bizarre (to me) situation. My final interview for this job was 9/9. On 9/30 the recruiter, who is a third party contractor/consultant, told me the hiring team wants to make me an offer. Slow, but great news.Then, a week of silence. I emailed the recruiter for an update on 10/11, and she promptly replies with something vague about ‚Äústill waiting on offer details from the Reward team but some stakeholders are taking longer than anticipated.‚ÄùSo it has now been over 2 weeks since I was told I‚Äôd be getting an offer. I cannot imagine what is taking so long after the decision has been made. Shouldn‚Äôt they have a pay grade and such identified before posting the job?I can‚Äôt think why the recruiter might be lying to me. Even if I‚Äôm the backup candidate and she‚Äôs trying to ensure I don‚Äôt take another offer, you wouldn‚Äôt say an offer is coming right? You‚Äôd say something like ‚Äúno decision has been made yet‚Äù or something.This is a massive international company over 20x the size of my current employer. I‚Äôm wondering:will I ever get an offer or are they stringing me along in someway I‚Äôm not seeing, and;should I interpret this as a red flag that this is how the company operates day-to-day and it‚Äôll be a nightmare trying to get anything done there (or have a career there if this is even just HR)?"
[NY] My new manager keeps trying to undermine me and downplay my success. What are my options?,"Been at my current job for 2 years and for the first 1.5 years, I had a great manager who really uplifted me and helped me grow. He nudged me to take risks while having my back and I was able to succeed and grow my own team of two direct reports. I built a reputation as a strong performer, was given multiple recognition awards, and a promotion. I also developed a reputation across organizations and have led many company-wide events. Basically a lot of people know me, like me, and respect me even though I‚Äôm just a middle manager. Leadership told me that they see a bright future for me at the company.My manager left 6 months ago for something else and his replacement was a distant, but internal transfer. I was not asked to interview him and most people suspect that he was a budget hire (we don‚Äôt pay as much as the rest of our industry).The new manager IMMEDIATELY struck me as a problem because he made bold and unsubstantiated claims of what he did in the other department. Furthermore, he had little interest in what I worked on or what my strategies were for our team and claimed to have all the answers. I made many attempts explain how he was misaligned with what we do and what our actual problems are, but it was futile. He had his one speech and his buzzwords and just kept repeating them in meetings. I realized that we couldn‚Äôt really work together, so just kept doing my thing and ignored him.He met with many teams and and orgs quickly developed a bad reputation among them. Everyone could see that he was just a smooth talker who claimed to be a visionary. Maybe he really believes that he is, but few others else do.So I kept doing my thing and ignoring him, but then he found out how powerful my reputation and brand are. Instead of continuing to uplift me and partner with me, he chose to hire a new manager in between us. This manager was his former colleague and seemed to believe in him.Now, both of them are starting to push me out of the picture and utilizing their authority to do so. They are replacing me in important meetings and downplaying my achievements by promising that they can do it better. They proposed a big shakeup to our org behind both mine and my colleagues backs. They have secret meetings with my partner teams and claim that they‚Äôre the new points of contact going forward. I find out about all of these shadow meetings from the other attendees who are confused and telling me that they prefer to work with me instead.I raised this to some leadership, but they brushed it off and told us to figure it out ourselves. They are happy with the work that is getting done (mostly by me) and don‚Äôt want to help with conflict resolution.I‚Äôm sure that my new and toxic managers have their own side to of all of this, but I believe that they are feeling threatened by my success and insecure about their lack of capability. They probably can‚Äôt get me fired because of my broader reputation and so are using their authority to slowly sideline me. They literally use terms like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre resetting the partnerships.‚ÄùSince leadership won‚Äôt help, would going to HR help? I can show documentation of how they misrepresented facts, hid decks that called out teams for things they didn‚Äôt do, and withheld important info from me and others. But could they retaliate by saying I‚Äôve been insubordinate by not blindly following their new ‚Äúway of working‚Äù?It‚Äôs been really stressful and the job market is not so great right now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm almost to the point of sucking it up, but I don‚Äôt want to give up‚Ä¶ was leadership not telling me something about me and chose to knowingly go in a new direction? I‚Äôm so lost now‚Ä¶"
[CA] [QC] just found out that a recently hired person (1 month) reporting to me is looking for other jobs. Is this enough to ask the person to leave before the end of his 3 months probation period?,"Location - Quebec, Canada"
[NL] I am afraid of getting fired.,"I am a student studying a bachelors degree in a university and work as a logistic employee. I am a non-eu student so I had to get a work permit to work for the company. My manager is furious on me for applying for his position(will be working with him), the vacancy was an entry level job and just asked bachelor degree thinking level. He basically told me that I am 18 and that I am immature because of that and also that I am moving too fast. He said that it was like backstabbing as I didn't inform him about my application. He had the authority to reject my application and he did it. I understood his opinions on me and proceeded to apply without informing(to reduce his influence) for a entry level position(internal vacancy) that is related to my study. This position was not in anyway related to him so he didn't have access to my application. But he came to know it from my co-worker and now he is threatening to not extend my contract because of this and he said he will contact the recruiting HR and tell him/her that I am not a good profile. I have tried to talk with him before about my motives but he has decided that I am not capable of doing any other job without even knowing my capabilities and qualifications. He said that I am not working hard and I asked him if he had proof of it and he replied that if I had any proof that I worked hard(there is no monitoring system). I believe that he is building up reasons to fire me or not to extend my contract. The HRs here doesn't really care about these conflicts. The hierarchical level here is too much, the higher position's word remains final and cannot argue against it. Cant really search for another job as approval for work permit is pain in the ass for recruiters.Is there anything I can do. Please let me know.Thanks in advance."
[CA] [NV] verification of salary?,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to read my inquiry.I have a manager at my job who is asking me to verify a potential employee‚Äôs salary.It is my understanding that this is not lawful in California or Nevada but I want to be explicitly clear on this when I report back.Can anyone confirm?"
[NY] Does end date show up on background check?,"Hi everyone -On Monday I gave my two weeks notice at my current role. I was deep into a few processes, and wanted out of my horrible position ASAP and knew I would get an offer soon. I have just gotten one, but I am wondering, on the background check, will they see my end date? They said the check will happen next week, and my last day is that Friday. I just don‚Äôt want any questions raised about why I‚Äôve already quit, etc etc. It would also be nice to get some time off in between.Does your end date show up in a background check?"
[CA] Am I being illegally underpaid?,"Hello all,I'm trying to fully understand my situation here and not jump into any negotiations with my employer without the full picture and make sure I have a complete understanding of California Law (which I probably don't).For context: I work for a start-up company in California, and am currently being paid a 40k yearly salary. I recently discovered that for a smaller company (<25 employees) the minimum yearly salary is 58k.Even with commission I don't really come close to this figure. Is this something to bring up to my employer? Is there something that would make me unqualified for the minimum?Thanks so much for your advice in advance."
"[IL] I reside in IL but this position will be fully remote with the base location in CA. In negotiations for start date at new company, asked for a start date 2 months down the line, should would it be prudent for me to give the reason for the later start date.","So I have been told by the HR rep that an offer is incoming (i know, nothing definite, but i want to be prepared for the situation).  In my last round of interviews, I was asked for my start date and I asked for 2023, when asked if there was a reason I said it was part business related and part family related (have a lot of vacation planned for the holiday season and don't want to  take most of my PTO at the start of a new company when i've been saving for it and covered by my current job).  They seem to want me to start earlier and mentioned that they would able to pay for my PTO and provide ample more, but also stopped the conversation there as it was more of just a finalization of the first round.The business related side of things is: I have a small chunk of change in stock options that vests in November, and also have a 12% bonus that gets paid out the first paycheck of 2023 (this is based on company performance and as our current company just finished it's fiscal year the financial report was sent out and we're doing well.  Historically, it's 12% * a business modifier factor depending on how well the company did.  Last year it was 123% and this year seems like it'll be trending the same way).While i don't have the exact number for a new salary, i have a range, and it certainly wouldn't be enough to cover the bonus and stock options that will be accessible shortly.Would it be kosher to disclose these items if the start date is further discussed?"
[MA] Employer Insurance Opt-Out program discrimination,My full time employer offers $75 per week to anyone who will opt-out if their insurance and provide documentation of their own.I filed for it and provided my parents insurance (I‚Äôm 23) they refused and said they do not accept people under their parents. Does that sound correct? Something to do with section 125 or form 2015-87
[CA] Leave options for difficult pregnancies,I‚Äôve had a rough pregnancy. At 16 weeks and still throwing up almost every day. Work and stress and truly exacerbated my symptoms and I‚Äôm wondering what my options are for taking a break.Would it usually just be FMLA? My company gives us 4 months for mat leave but I feel I need relief now.I can reach out to my HR department but trying to get a temp check first.
[CA] drove company vehicle for 3 days on a suspended license. what should I do?,"A few years ago I got a DUI. My lawyer didn't settle until about 6 months after the incident and when he did my license was suspended. I didn't know license was suspended and drove company vehicle for a couple days before realizing my lawyer had settled and license was suspended. At that point I told the County what happened, DUI and everything. It took a few weeks but I eventually returned to work and everything was fine.Fast forward a couple years to this week. My auto insurance was canceled and the SR 22 that needs to be filed with DMV was canceled and my license was suspended. I didn't find out until after I had driven a company vehicle for 3 days. When I find out I didn't drive any longer and now my license is fine and valid.At my yearly annual review, HR runs my driving record or something and the license suspension will probably be mentioned along with DUI and other stuff. There's a chance they find license was suspended and check back and find out I drove county vehicle those days.Should I come clean or just wait and see if they find out? If they do find out, I could just say I didn't drive the company vehicle that day and they would have no way to prove I did. What should I do?"

Missing Pay [NJ],"I was recently hired for a 9-5 job, however after the first day of work I was promptly let go because it turns out the work schedule was actually NOT 9-5 but actually a 10 hour work shift M-F. This wasn't communicated to me by my recruiter who got me the job and I wasn't able to work those hours so I understood being let go.Here is where the problem starts. I was told by my recruiter that I would be getting pay for the work that I did on that one day but it has now been almost 3 weeks and I haven't received anything. I reached out to the recruiter and they said they would check the status but I haven't heard back. I also reached out to a higher up regarding my missing pay and I haven't heard back from them either.I'm not quite sure what else to do besides constantly sending them emails about my missing pay. I'd appreciate any advice on what else I could possibly do!"
[PA] I got laid off yesterday for the first time in my life. I'm not sure what to do. Any tips or advice/,"Yesterday, I got laid off from the company I was with for almost 4 years. I felt completely blind-sighted, even though in hindsight I shouldn't have (they were laying people off left and right and I work in the training department).They said my position ends November 1 (which is surprising because a lot of people they have been laying off recently were told their position ended that day), and they're offering severance as well.I guess I'm looking for tips, advice, what to do next, etc. As the title states, I've never been laid off before.Also, I guess it's good that they are keeping me until November 1 (right?), however- I'm having a hard time picturing myself being able to focus or feel motivated to produce quality work for them. But I want to leave on a good note- I have a good rapport with my manager and her manager.Thanks in advance for the help."
[UK] Should I be informed of a grievance outcome if the grievance was against me?,"I have no faith in the company's handling of the process. I had an investigation, and was never properly informed of the grounds of the grievance. I know the case is finished and HR have been given the decision to communicate, but the outcome hasn't been sent to me. Its causing me a great deal of stress and feels like I can't move on until I know what the outcome was one way or the other."
HR Question [MN],"Hello Reddit,I have a serious HR question. My current company where I work have a bad track record(Bad management, retention of worker ,etc.). But That not the issue I'm, facing. In our workplace we're expected to wear safety glasses and steel toe shoes. We have one employee(Money) who don't wear both of them in a daily basis. I have brought this up to HR but they only caught her once without safety glasses. They didn't check her shoe( black croc shoe with black sock). I understand that It would be hard for HR to check or monitor things because I work 2nd shift(10hr shift). Most of the HR would leave soon after we start. But this person is part of a clique/group in the company. This group is make up of Supervisor(King Kong), lead( John Doe, Lisa), Trainer(Moon) and worker(Money, Karen, Sally). The boss would cover them for taking excess break + smoke break, not wear safety equipment, clocking them out or fixing their time card. Recently I reported an employee to my Supervisor(King Kong). Let call this employee(Karen). Karen would purpose yell and talk loudly and make decision without the Lead(John Doe) Input or without talking to us about her changes. She would move people to train in different station because she feel like it. Even though she not a trainer or lead. My boss would take her side and said it's better to train everyone. But he didn't hold any meeting with the groups. I report on her(Karen) to Supervisor(King Kong) that I don't like her yelling. She would come up behind us and yell at us. It would cause me to Jump/Spook/Scare me. I told Supervisor(King Kong) today that we work with machine and heavy equipment. What If drop a 10 pound parts on my thigh, hand, feet's (That why we wear steel toe shoes). Also what If my hand were touching the machine. What If I got spook at that time and my hand get caught in the machine? After telling Supervisor(King Kong) this he had a long talk with Karen. But somehow Sally involve herself into this mess. Supervisor(King Kong) came back to me and told me that how she talk and act. So ignore her. Toward the end of today Karen and Sally would try to provoke me to get a reaction from me. What should I do? They're trying to retaliate and the boss is covering for them. I just want them to stop yelling so I won't get injured. Should I escalate this to HR if they do something funny?"
[MN] Is Web Cam and Screen Recording Policy of Contract Remote Workers Legal?,"Received an offer from a company for a year long contact, and they have a web cam recording policy where I sign to consent to being recorded ‚Äúto ensure I am the person they interviewed‚Äù during the duration of my contract. I am not in MN, the companies are.This is extremely alarming, because I work remotely since I and my infant have health conditions (daycare not advised), so we have in-home childcare (nanny for 40-50 hours a week). I am also still his main food source.How does this even hold up? I am going to assume that if I refuse to sign, the offer will be rescinded?"

[AZ] Phone confiscated as soon as I clock in,"So as the title says, once I clocked in my boss had seen me from the corner of her eye and immediately yells out my name to come to her office. No explanation she demands me to hand her my phone and she will keep it for the entire shift.I start my shift and I see that everyone else is allowed to have their phones and AirPods on. Mind you I work at a front desk for a ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù resort and my coworkers go to the back while I‚Äôm at the front desk working my ass off and they‚Äôre on social medias watching videos and my boss is on her phone showing them pictures of her grandchildren. They‚Äôre laughing and doing nothing. I was pissedI go to my (unpaid)break and I don‚Äôt get my phone back either. I had to constantly get up from eating to make sure I wasn‚Äôt going past my break because there‚Äôs no clocks at the break room. So I‚Äôm annoyed.Before she leaves she hands me my phone and says that if she sees me with it again I will get fired. She said she got a complaint that another employee from a different department had seen me with my phone 20 mins before my shift ends. I‚Äôm legit done with my work it‚Äôs downtime. I have nothing else to do.Is my boss allowed to do this? Why am I the only one being held under strict rules.

[NV] Non-Compete Help,"California/NevadaHi hello! I have a quick question in regards to Non-Competes. I signed one in 2020 when I lived in the state of California and have since moved to Nevada. I left the company back in March and was upfront about the company I was moving to and technically it was a competitor but on a low level. Unfortunately my position was recently eliminated and I applied and got a job at another company that is also a competitor but on my much deeper level. I‚Äôm concerned the first employer that I mentioned will find out that I‚Äôm at this new company and will try to fight me. I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm at risk given I signed this agreement when living in CA (address on document)? Also, does it make a difference that I had another job in between this one? The agreement was for 1 year and restricts me from working for any competitor in the same industry. It will be up in March 2023. Help! Thank you!!"
[CT] FMLA,"FMLA- Connecticut Hourly EmployeeI‚Äôve been with the same company for 20 years and have FMLA for a chronic condition. Out of work with a work injury now, and they made me qualify for FMLA  (along with workers comp).I notice when I check my FMLA leave times for both accounts, they show the same amount of time has been taken. Is this taking away from time I‚Äôll be able to use FMLA for my chronic condition when I return? It shows the same amount taken for FMLA and Connecticut Family Leave.If I‚Äôm out of work say three-four months, will that make me ineligible to re apply for FMLA when mine expires?

[CAN-ON] Do I need a revised job contract for WFH?,"My company went 100% remote in 2020 and has repeatedly said they will not be going back to in-person work, ever.

[CA] Bonus payout on last day of employment,"Below are the facts of the case:Employee has quarterly bonus agreement with company based on some sets of goals.Per HR written email, the bonus will be paid out on the first paycheck after quarter end.July pay periods were 7/8 and 7/22.Employee was hoping to get the bonus on 7/8 and resign on 7/11 with last day on 7/22.Apparently the bonus was not processed on 7/8 payroll and most likely will be processed on 7/22 payroll which is also the last day of the employee.Will the employee be entitled to the bonus?"
Salary Negotiation Backfire [NY],"Hihi HR experts.So I've been in a scenerio where I think the recruiter was a little inexperienced and mentioned the budget to the salary for 120k and then she goes back to me the next day and told me it would be 90-100k, would I be okay with that. I go along with it and say yes so I can speak with the ppl hiring the role instead of getting cut early on.I go through the entire interview process and was praised for how I am the ideal candidate and perfect choice.I get back to the HR phase of the interview and I am offered the role for 90k. told them no still believe and feel the role should be in the 120k range... And that's my number. Then they come back with 100k....and at this point knew I should keep pressing at least once but gave in and took it because it is the most ideal thing for my career.What should I have done better next time?"
Resigning with Negative PTO [CA],"First time posting, please let me know if anything goes against rules.I am resigning from my salaried position with a CA company in Los Angeles.I have been working this position for 6 months and have not received any employee handbook other than a procedures guide for the actual work we're doing. No employee guidance really. I have asked for a handbook and been told that they are working on updating it. That was over a month ago. I asked again this week and specified that I was asking because I needed ""any document I can refer to at this time to better understand how to proceed with certain procedures and actions as an employee"" and was given a response of ""We will take care of this next week after the deadline.""If I didn't formally request the PTO, and it was confirmed that I never received any company policy on employee PTO, can they deduct the negative PTO from my final paycheck?My main reason for asking is because I have negative PTO from July when I was exposed to covid on my last day of vacation and had to extend my time off from work. I did not formally request PTO for the extended time out of office, but I received it anyway leading me to severe negative PTO (-66 hours then but worked down to -54 hours now).6 weeks later I had a meeting with HR and the president confirming that I did not have PTO policy given to me and I was not aware I was even receiving it until after it was too late. They confirmed that they had not explained it to me and I did not have any employee handbook other than a procedures guide for the actual work we're doing. That was in late August. Still no documents now.I would like to resign and have my last day be this upcoming Tuesday. Due to lack of handbook/guidance on resignation, how should I proceed?"
[CAN] Has your employer asked you to make odd policies?,"My current situation is this:I'm the only HR person at my small start-up company and I'm taking courses while working.We have an employee who has used all their vacation time for the year. The owners/my bosses want to give the employee an additional 2 weeks of paid time off.I suggested this would set a precedent where other employees will want the same treatment and there's little to back up a 'no'. The most fair/best course of action is to grant everyone extra time off (for similar reasons at the very least) or no one gets that extra paid time off.The owners now want me to write a policy saying they have the freedom to be generous to any employee as they see fit.I think this could be viewed as favouritism/pitting employees against one another for special treatment.How realistic is it to write a policy that gives the bosses the 'freedom to be generous'? Can this actually, legally be done?"
A chemical engineer and energy processes with 3 years as an account manager (sales) experience in a top 500 Electrical distribution company [MX] currently studying abroad a Master in Finance [IT] . How this adds up? Have you seen it? It fits certain type of profile hard to find?,"So I studied chemical engineering with a minor in sustainable processes and then tested the coorporate world for 1 year in a advanced development commercial program of rotations an then 2 years in a key account manager position in a top 500 company of electrical distribution. Now I decided to study abroad a master in finance focuses on Green Energy Market Finance. Now I am having doubts in how this will help my career cause I hope to at least continue my current career since it was great salary and in a top 500 company, now I am afraid its just a waste of time. I study the master because I like to study and right now Finance is of my interest but I hope If I decide to go back to the same career path it boosts my career, it was a good salary tbh. I want to study this master cause I feel sometimes finance sector is missing the understanding of engineering and make decisions based purely on finance."

[MI] Raise due to retention/workload,"Hi all! Im an engineer that works with vehicle safety. My team is supposed to consist of 6 engineers, 1 lead engineer, and our direct manager. Our team has yet to fill 2/6 engineering positions so the workload is already a lot. One engineer, we'll call him ""X"", is about to leave for the exact same role at another company that is offering $20k/year more. This will mean we have half of the engineers needed. Workload will be redistributed and even worse off than it is now. Me and X have the exact same prior experience and started at this company at the exact same time as well, which was only 7 months ago. I also know he was already making 2k more than me.How do i go about asking for a raise due to these circumstances? And how much is acceptable? Im currently making $73k. Is asking for $80k too much?Very interested in hearing the HR input on this!"

[NY] Previous company asking for reimbursement of overpay after termination.,Hello. Company is in NY and I am now in PA. My previous employer sent me an email 2 months after my termination stating I was overplayed and they are requesting I pay it back.Previously the company attempted getting money from me  asking me to pay an insurance premium after the insurance period lapsed when I did not ask them to continue the insurance after my employment.

[CA] Insurance terminated 1 month before layoff,"I was laid off from my job at the end of July 2022. However I recently received a notice in the mail from my insurance stating I owe them money because my coverage was terminated in June 2022. I did not receive any other notices or communication about this change.I called the insurance company and confirmed the termination dates were all in June 2022 on their end, when I thought I was covered through July until I was laid off. I have emailed HR a few times asking them to look into it and have not heard back.Is this legal? Is there an agency I should escalate this issue with if HR at my old company does not respond?"
[MA] Does having a higher level certification hurt my chances for a job?,"I recently applied to a job opening for an EMT at a fire department not far from my house. This fire department is switching from all volunteer Emergency Medical Services to a combo paid/volunteer. Technically I am overqualified for the position as the requirements are a Massachusetts EMT certification, CPR and 2 years experience as an EMT. I hold a Paramedic certification, Advanced CPR certifications and I‚Äôve been in the field for 9 years. While this position is a lower level than I currently am in my profession. It‚Äôs a municipal job with town benefits and it would only be a small pay cut compared to what I‚Äôm making now (I work for the lowest paying agency in my area and Massachusetts pays better overall) would being overqualified hurt me in this situation?"
[AL] Is my boss sexually harassing me?,"I have been at my current job for a little over a year. This all started a couple of months after I started my job. I think my boss is sexually harassing me. It started with him asking if I was up for a ""challenge"" with him. He has been asking me to help him with picking out women's items for himself. I was always uncomfortable with it but never felt like I could say no or tell him I was uncomfortable. Even when he asked. I didn't feel like I could because he's my boss and I also thought he could have issues with his gender identity. I wanted to be supportive of an older man who didn't know how to express that. He has given me his personal money to buy holiday decor for the office and asked specifically for ""cute"" and ""girly"" things for his office as part of our ""challenge"". He has asked for my opinion on women's hairstyles he wants to try and if I thought it was too obviously feminine. He has asked me to pick out women's shoes for him before and tried to buy us matching women's shoes. He will wear androgynous clothing and ask if I noticed or what I thought of them. The entire time this has been happening I was uncomfortable and it felt... off but I didn't know how tell him that. He has asked me to buy girly office supplies for him too. All of these have happened repeatedly for about a year now. He is incredibly petty and unpleasant to people who he does not like. I also did not want to come across as transphobic. I truly do not care if people wear clothes not designed for their gender. I support and affirm the trans community. Recently I found out he has done the same and more to two other female co-workers. One he sent photos to of him in women's clothing, of lingerie asking which he should buy and wear, and he also changed into women's clothing for her with her in his office without telling her what was happening or for her consent.For better context, we work at a university. I have the lowest position on campus and he has one of the highest. When he found out I'm taking a class that gets out late he offered to let me stay the night at his house so I didn't have to make my hour commute back. It seems nice on the surface but given everything else, it seems not appropriate either.Am I being sexually harassed and do I have enough to go to HR? If they do nothing about it but he finds out then I still have to work directly for him."
[NY] Better to start on-boarding or wait?,"[NY] I was up for a position I really wanted. After a successful second interview in which the company was encouraging, I didn‚Äôt hear back for a couple of weeks.    In the meantime, I accepted another job which I am less excited about because I gave up hope on my preferred job. I am supposed to schedule my on-boarding today for this second lob. So, today the interviewer of the job I really want asked me to meet her boss for a third interview.  I don‚Äôt want to burn any bridges. Is it better for me to start this job if there‚Äôs a good chance I would leave very soon? Or is it better to not waste their time on-boarding me and let them move on with another candidate?  I don‚Äôt know which is the more professional thing to do."
[NC] US Federal employee holiday pay questions,"This post is fairly specific in who it applies to, and I'm cross-posting to a few subs that seem applicable because I've been looking answers to these questions for a few years now and can't seem to get any that are consistent.Apologies if you have seen this post in a different sub. If you know of a better one to post in, please let me know!Posting from my phone. Sorry.For context, I work in the U.S. and am a Federal employee, so OPM rules apply.Facts/evidence/references are what I'm asking for, because it affects people's income and I will need to be able to point to something and say ""this is why"" when finance (or whoever) comes asking.I am about to put out the 2023 work schedule and I have a weekend holiday situation that I have questions about. I‚Äôve had this question in previous years, and gone through multiple people/levels of both finance and HR and can‚Äôt get a consistent answer from anyone, so I‚Äôm hoping that someone here can shed some light on the situation ‚Äì and provide more than just opinion (i.e. references/documentation) ‚Äì so that I have something better to go by when explaining this situation to other people. ¬†Here is a description of the issue: ¬†"
Being recorded in the workplace [UK],"so my colleague has just informed that my bosses have been watching us on cameras, ( we were not even aware that they had installed them). The reason the boss even mentioned it is because he was watching them sat down doing nothing for like 20 minutes. We have looked on the system and cant find any cctv or anything so I am assuming they have been watching through their personal phone, we have googled it and it says to record us they need to let us know for our consent but they did not ask us anything, apparently its been going on for maybe a month or less. When my colleague spoke to the boss he said make sure not to tell anyone else also he said that these are a specific kind of camera where he doesn't need to tell us about them. I am just confused about what to do, its my first proper job so I don't really know anything about this kind of thing so any advice would be appreciated!"
[PA] Question regarding Philadelphia's Fair Chance law,"Fairly straight forward question here, in order for a company to have to adhere to the law, does the company have to be based in Philadelphia, or just the employee?"
[PA] Resigning after two weeks?,"I started a new job, in an entirely new field, last week and realized on my second day the position was not for me. I resolved to stick it out for the week, speak to my supervisor about my concerns, try to address them, and develop a back up plan. By Friday, I had suffered through an average of two panic attacks a day and had none of my concerns addressed. This week I worked on a back up plan and was told by my old boss I could get back on the schedule (part-time) as early as next week and I‚Äôve started the interviewing process with a company I‚Äôm much more familiar and comfortable with, in a field I‚Äôm much more familiar and comfortable with.My question then is, when talking to my supervisor about resigning would it be appropriate to give two weeks notice even though my entire role is simply training at this point? Or would it be more appropriate to just leave after this week is over?"
[VA] Discrepancy in application and background check?,I recently realized a mistake I made on my job application. I have been with the the same company for 5 years now and the dates I put between internship and full time were around 2 months off. How detrimental is this for a background check?
[IE] Resign and Face a Nice boss,I got an offer for a similar role but with a 30% bump in the salary. I recently got promoted but I‚Äôm still below salary average‚Ä¶ might not be the most important thing but with all the price increases around here it became a concern. Love my team and I enjoy what I do and my boss is the nicest person I‚Äôve met in a work environment. I‚Äôm feeling bad for wanting to leave because of money. I don‚Äôt know exactly how to approach my boss with the news‚Ä¶ should I meet them and explain why and planning to leave? Should I send a resignation letter first? This is the first time I‚Äôm planning to leave a company without the feeling of ‚Äúhope this place burns down‚Äù.
[IL] my company is promoting me to a position with a lot more responsibility without discussing salary,"Hi I need some advice on this situation. I began working at this company as a support position two months ago. I mentioned to my manager that in a few months (once I get more familiar with training and feel confident in my current role, I‚Äôd like to step into a manager role. Next thing I know, I got an email scheduling training to transition my role where I‚Äôd be taking on multiple projects. Salary was never discussed even though there‚Äôs a drastic difference in responsibility. I have a lot going on in my personal life and I know if I take on a much heavier work load without compensation I‚Äôm going to get burnt out. I also just started and this is my first job post grad so I‚Äôm not sure how to approach this situation regarding compensation because of timing.Do you suggest I mention a pay increase now before I‚Äôm too deep into training? If so do I talk to my supervisor or HR?If they don‚Äôt offer pay raise, would it be okay to decline this ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù and focus on my current role?"
[CA] Is it typical for recruiters to ask you to provide your W2 before you interview?,"I had a recruiter at a firm (who seems employed by the firm, not a 3rd party recruiting firm) reach out to me last week about a role at their company.  I'm not actively looking for a role, but it seemed interesting, so I had a call with the recruiter last Friday.  We ended the call that I was interested in interviewing, and she thought I would be a good fit for the role.This week, we had some back and forth over email (and her email seems legit from the company) about scheduling an interview.  We settled on tomorrow at 11 am for the interview.Earlier today, she called me to confirm everything for tomorrow and ensured I got the zoom meeting invite.  Then she wanted to confirm my salary expectations because the hiring manager saw my resume and is interested in my background.  So I gave them to her, but she didn't react either way, so I assumed she was okay with my salary ask.I received a VM and an email from her late this afternoon asking for my latest W2 to confirm that I'm currently making within this salary range.  I thought that was an odd request because what I'm asking for is pretty standard for my type of role.  I'm an enterprise technical architect and if you go on salary.com what I'm asking for is within the typical salary range for my role.I responded to her email asking for more details about why she requires this information.Is this a typical/legit ask from a recruiter? I've been working for over 15 years at several companies and have only provided W2 if asked during the background check after accepting an offer.   I'm not comfortable emailing my W2 to a recruiter since it has such sensitive information.  I haven't interviewed in about 2 years and have been working at this company for 6, so maybe things have changed a bit since the pandemic?  I'm not sure would love some input from this forum."
[NJ] Thoughts on a Buddy System?,"Hi everyone~ My company is trying to implement a buddy system for obvious reasons: employee retention, engagement, reducing siloed departments, etcI have all my ""equipment"" *90 day checklist *list of buddy activities *logistics on how to pair buddies *dates for launching *evaluations Etc.I feel like this is one of those things where we'll get however much we put in...so my dept can give out checklists and guides and activity ideas all we want but if senior buddies are too busy to take care of their junior buddies...well, there goes that and...probably my end of year bonus...jk we don't have that anywaysDoes anyone have any experience with integrating a buddy system? Things that work? Things that don't work? Incentive ideas to get people motivated but an incentive that doesnt become the main focus? Am I approaching this the wrong way entirely?Thoughts, opinions, concerns, suggestions...I'd love to hear everything and anything! Thanks!"
"[CAN] HR in companies with high turnover ie frequent firings/layoffs, how does it affect you? Things like career, mental health, networking, relationships etc?","Just curious about HR people in this situation...is this a skill that they brag about on their resume or is this a task that can burn bridges and have consequences on their long term career? Do they enjoy it and take pride in doing it professionally or does it mess with their head?Edit: So I'm asking because at my current company, the HR manager is only seen when people are being let go and this has led to her inadvertently cultivating a negative, executioner like image/persona.Will this person be hirable at other companies? Will she have good recommendations, hiring prospects for other jobs? What if she ends up in a company where one of the people she let go was in a position of power?"
Advice Needed: Recruiter laughed at me when I tried to negotiate my promotion offer by phone. How can I submit a complaint and still negotiate the offer? [TX] goverment job,"Update: I accepted the offer and am drafting a thank you email to my supervisors. I will not email/address the recruiter. I am applying for jobs outside of this company.I work for a TX government entity. This is my 5th year at the company. I was promised a raise a year ago. Today, I was contacted by a recruiter for my title promotion  and raise by phone. He offered me $12K more than what I currently make. I said yes during the call but called back to try to negotiate my salary. I asked for at least $2K more. The maximum for my current position is $7K more than what I was offered. I was denied any change in the offer, so I asked about the maximum yearly promotion rate. The recruiter laughed at least twice. I asked him what was funny and he said he didn't know the answer to my rate question. I ended the call quickly, because I was so furious , felt dismissed and humiliated. After the call, he emailed me an official offer email.How should I handle this situation? I am looking for advice and/or draft edits. My ultimate goal is to speak with a different recruiter and negotiate the salary before I accept the offer. I am leaning towards replying to his email and CC'ingHR, my supervisor and Employee Relations.Here is my email response draft so far:Thank you for your email and offer of (dollar amount) for the Coordinator position. However, I found your attitude during our second phone conversation completely unprofessional. I do not appreciate that you laughed repeatedly while I tried to negotiate for a salary that is closer to the maximum of my current position and asked about the maximum yearly merit rate. There was nothing funny about the conversation.¬†I would expect even a new recruiter to be knowledgeable about general company benefits. Instead of laughing, a more professional and appropriate response would have been to refer me to a coworker that could answer my¬†questions.¬†In my 5 years at (this company), I have never been treated this way by a recruiter. It is so shocking to me that an acquisition 'specialist' would behave this way. No employee should be laughed at and made feel lesser than regardless of their title.¬†I wouldn‚Äôt want another candidate to have the same negative experience I did.¬†Before I can seriously consider this offer, I am requesting that a different recruiter, preferably your supervisor, contact me to discuss this position and the benefits further. I have taken the liberty to cc my supervisor, HR, and Employee Relations."
[WV] Can I split how employees are paid?,"Is there a way to pay employees both an hourly rate and a piece rate in a production environment?

[FL] Dependent care FSA forfeited,"My spouse contributes to dependent care FSA. We have about $2,500 in the account serviced by Wex.Her employer merged/bought by competitor around June 2022. FSA servicing was transferred from Wex to TriAd. Wex says that all funds should have been claimed by end of September 2022 and that the funds have now been forfeited.I‚Äôm the partner responsible for submitting claims.

[MO] FMLA violation??,"Since I've started on intermittent FMLA leave I have had both my supervisor and the big boss add job duties to my workload. My spouse has Non-Hodkins Lymphoma and I need to take him to his Chemo treatments or just care for him when he's been too weak to walk. They have both written me up for not being able to complete things by the time frame given me and causing major problems for the department. One of them even stated that ""They are productive when they are at the office, however..."" basically saying that 2 weeks earlier I had told my supervisor that I would be at the office 4 days per week, and then I ""called off"" (their words, not mine) 3 mornings that week and one whole day. Nothing said about why. It was because my spouse had new symptoms which were very unexpected and serious, just before his last Chemo treatment. So serious that he was admitted to the hospital.Again this week, he has had new symptoms and again I took FMLA to get him seen by the doctor. The result is scans, tests, and specialist doctor visits this week and next. I fully expect them to try to write me up again.I feel like I want to tell them that they are violating my FMLA leave, but I know they will see this as just me being defensive and will go through with it anyway.I just want confirmation that they are violating FMLA law, and if anyone can point me to where I can get printed information about this to use, that would be great.Thank you for your time, and assistance."
[FL] Should I preemptively call HR about my coworker telling other coworkers I'm a racist?,"[UPDATE]Thank you all for your help and advice. HR met with her and the boss last week. She is now accusing 4+ more people of racism and refusal to train. I heard from another coworker that she is lying about her experience. The boss asked for a copy of her resume, but no one was about to produce it. I'm more than a little frustrated because I'm scheduled to work with her this week. I expressed my concerns and I feel that they've been ignored. I'm tired.I work for a national company based out of Florida, so that is where corporate HR is located. We travel around the country for work. One of the people I work with when I'm at my home location just told our manager that I refused to train her because she's brown. First, I did train her. Second, I'm not a racist! I'd never say anything like that and I'm sad and angry that she would make those accusations. My manager told me she was investigating, but I'm wondering if all of you think I should go to HR preemptively to let them know I am aware of the accusations and that they are false. Thank you all for reading."
[IL] surgery and time off,"I work in Illinois, live in Wisconsin. I am a salaried employee with lots of PTO. Here is my situation:In August I notified my boss and HR in writing that I would have an upcoming surgery, which they both acknowledged. At that time I put in for a week off for recovery, which was approved. I was told we have to use up PTO before FMLA, no problem, I have the time.In September I sent a reminder email to both of them, and at that time explained that my only restrictions were to be driving and lifting, but I would be able to WFH as long as I wasn't on pain meds or having complications (which I'm not). This was again acknowledged by both of them.Now(10/12), I had my surgery 10/7, received and submitted my doctor's work release for WFH, and have been working normal hours the last 3 days. Today, I asked that my time be adjusted to reverse my PTO since I am working, as previously communicated, and my boss emailed back that she wants me to return to the office, and I have not been cleared to do so. I sent her the original email, work release, and my time punches (I still punch even though I am not required to), and if needed I have other time stamped activities I can provide to prove I worked.This is actually the second time after a surgery they have done this, and last year I ended up returning to the office 1 day after an appendectomy without any work release.Is this legal? If they fire me is this something I could sue over? I'm looking for a new job anyways but this is bogus."
[AL] Boss consistently asks us to work through lunch.,"Alabama. Healthcare Admin/Communications/Internal Comms.I really enjoy my job, and I like all of my coworkers, including my boss. They all treat me and each other well.I‚Äôm not sure whether I should even complain about this at all, but I wanted to get a consensus of what was normal.For some context, when I was recruited for this job, the recruiter gave me a certain hourly rate. When I actually started, my boss was confused when I asked where and how to clock in/out. Apparently they had requested I be on salary, like everyone else in my department. So I was put on salary. My paycheck is the same as it would have been if I worked 40 hours a week on the original hourly rate.However, my gripe is that my boss is asking me (and my coworkers) to work during lunch fairly often. It usually isn‚Äôt the entire lunch, but 3 days out of 5, we only actually get to eat about 30 minutes of the hour we were told we‚Äôd get.I make a pretty decent amount of money per hour, and just wondered if it was wrong for me to feel like I‚Äôm getting gypped. I‚Äôm working about 8.5 hours a day and getting paid for the hourly equivalent of 8.Again, I understand that I‚Äôm luckier than many others and that having only one or two things I dislike about my job is a blessing. Just looking for some perspective."
[TX] Forced use of remaining PTO/Sick balance despite receiving Short-Term Disability,"Good afternoon!I just had a quick question. I recently had back surgery and currently on medical leave through FMLA. I found out that our Leaves department is forcing me to use the rest of my PTO/Sick balance despite receiving short-term disability after the 7-day waiting period.From my understanding, they can only force me to cover those first 7 days that were unpaid due to that waiting period for short-term disability. Am I correct in my assumption? I am going off of what I read about the Repa v, Roadway Express case."
[OK] I was fired over false allegations. How do I recover from this?,"Last year my employer fired me over false allegations. I was not able to properly defend myself at the time because I did not have all of the information. It took nearly a year for me to learn the whole story. I will give as much information as I can without violating my privacy.I worked for a place with a lot of rules, many of them very odd and overbearing. If I mentioned the name, many people here would recognize it and immediately have a bad impression. A few people would have a good impression. I was actually doing what I had trained to do and was in the position that I had always wanted. The pay was good for my field. I had a contract, but the atmosphere was toxic for many reasons. I was working with HR to build a case about the cause of some of the toxicity.The HR director asked me for some information. I had to contact 2 people no in my department to get that information. The people claimed no knowledge of what I was asking about. The next day their boss (a VP level position) comes into my office and asks me a strange question that made no sense to me.The next morning when I went into work I was locked out of my email and all other accounts. The HR director appeared and took me to my VP. I was accused of breaking a policy and placed on suspension pending an investigation. I had to turn over my keys, ID, etc.The next day I was allowed to give a statement where I denied the allegations. I could not make an effective defense because since I was innocent I did not know what evidence they might claim that they had against me. I wrote a follow-up letter explaining my side and once again denying the allegations. 2 days later my contract was terminated and I was fired.My unemployment was denied. I filed an appeal, which was finally heard a couple of months ago. During this hearing I learned a few things. Someone had entered my office and planted evidence.  I was supposedly warning about violating this policy in the past. 1) I never received any warning. 2) I never did what they accused me of doing. I swore under oath in front of a judge that I did not do what they had accused me of doing. They had 2 witnesses testify that I did. I learned that the VP who made the strange comment to me was the one who initiated the investigation into me. My lawyer was convinced that I was the victim of retaliation. The judge ruled against me.I am innocent of the charges against me. Most of my colleagues believe me. I got a new job, making significantly less than I did. My current employer does not care about this incident because they know me and they know how awful my former employer is. Emotionally and psychologically I am better off being away from that environment. Financially, I am in bad shape.How do I recover professionally from this experience?How do I explain this situation to future perspective employers?Thank you."
[NJ] should I tell my boss it‚Äôs about the money?,"I work for a decently sized financial/insurance corp. after a year, they said I can apply for other jobs within. I‚Äôm currently making $85k as a Business/Tech Analyst and I get a pension that‚Äôs fully vested after 3 years with the company, so I can‚Äôt leave yet. Already a year so I‚Äôm gonna start looking within.I feel bad because my boss has been super cool and accommodating. They‚Äôve had a not great turnover within the last year (I think 5 people left out of 9) & my boss has always asked if there‚Äôs anything they can do to improve. But I‚Äôve got 2 years to save for our new construction home & want to enter a DevOps role.My boss is gonna immediately question me leaving his group. Should I be honest and say it‚Äôs about the money & career progression or should I Strictly stick with career?"
[KY] Employee harasses and undermines me at work. How do I protect myself?,"I started a new job as a manager about 8 months ago. Generally speaking I love my job. My hours are very reasonable compared to my last career, I like my coworkers and I find the work we do to be very fulfilling. There is one major issue though. Part of my responsibility is managing a small part time staff. I am having major issues with one member of this staff (let‚Äôs call her Jennifer). I will start off by saying I have not taken on disciplinary responsibilities yet because our boss wanted to mitigate my professional responsibilities til I have a chance to learn how to do my job. I was made aware of this before I was hired as it was in the job description and I am totally fine with it.The first few weeks of my job before I was officially hired I worked at a special event my company sponsored. Jennifer was a staff member at this event too. I completed a minor task incorrectly and Jennifer berated me to the point that it made me extremely uncomfortable. After that incident she made it a point to follow me around and  give me really nitpicky feedback so I made it a point for the remainder of the week to be polite but distant.For the most part I have continued my strategy of polite distance. When I know Jennifer is coming in I put in my headphones, put my head down and work. (Which is not hard because I have a lot of responsibility and I am still learning how to do my job) Unfortunately Jennifer‚Äôs behavior has escalated to the point it is very difficult to ignore.Jennifer emails me frequently about things that are outside of her job responsibility that most of the time I am already dealing with. A lot of the time she cc‚Äôs my boss and sometimes she‚Äôll go speak to my boss directly if I don‚Äôt respond quickly enough or do things to her liking. Jennifer also goes above my head and makes changes to the program I run without consulting me. About a month ago she consulted with our technology coordinator and scheduled a meeting with him without discussing it with me at all. Several things like this have happened since I started in my position. Recently she has started getting into our shared drive at work and editing public files I have not edited to her liking.The worst incident that has occurred involved her screaming at me in front of the rest of our office staff. The issue was she wanted me to order a machine part and I didn‚Äôt do it. (I communicated with her beforehand i would not be ordering the part and why) I don‚Äôt feel comfortable giving her feedback because of her erratic behavior. I felt like this specific incident was intended to ‚Äúput me in my place‚Äù and Jennifer is used to bullying others to get her way.I have had multiple meetings with my boss and Jennifer. I have been told Jennifer has a history of treating people in my position badly. Another employee told me this was extremely frustrating for the last person in my position. My boss is fairly new to our company and I think she‚Äôs pretty great. She has limited Jennifer‚Äôs hours in the office and always takes my concerns seriously. All of our PT staff are buddies and I think there is some concern they‚Äôll all quit if Jennifer is fired and our company will be left in the lurch. Jennifer and her friends have been with our company for the last five years so I have some doubts she‚Äôll be dismissed any time soon.What should I be doing to protect myself and my job? Do you have any advice on dealing with this kind of person from an HR standpoint? I limit my interactions with jennifer as much as possible (which is difficult because I don‚Äôt have a private office), I communicate with my boss immediately when there are issues and I try not to meet with her if nobody else is present. My anxiety is sky high whenever I interact with Jennifer in any capacity. It is starting to have a really negative effect on mental health and I find myself really fixated on this issue."
[CA] Are coaching and mental health consultations really anonymous?,"We have professional coaching and mental health sessions available as a free benefit. I could use them to address issues like anxiety, impostor syndrome, negative self-talk, improve communication skills, etc., but I don't want my employer to know about it. Are they really anonymous?"
[CAN] Time off new employee,"I started a corporate managerial job in Canada at the end of August and training lasts about two months - still in training. Part of the benefits we receive is paid time off and I‚Äôll have about 4 days accumulated before the end of the year. If we don‚Äôt take the time off before dec 31, then those hours go to waste and you don‚Äôt get extra pay. General corporate guidelines is you shouldn't take time off in December for various reasons.So I am wondering does it leave a bad impression to use my paid time off hours even though I have only started recently? So really, after training, it‚Äôll be November and I‚Äôll have just that month to use 4 days off. Should I just let it go to waste or use it?"
Texas Over time question,"Can my boss require us to work over time and request we leave a few hours early the next day rather than pay us over time pay? We have an HR person, but she really only processes our payroll and has not been helpful in the past about HR related questions."
[PA] Requesting Accommodations for Mental Health/Learning Disabilities,"Hi everyone-Just looking for some guidance or feedback here. I'm based in PA but my employer is based in CA and has employees and offices in several different states and countries.I work remotely, in online support, and handle a variety of email, social, and chat support inquiries. When I trained for this position a year and a half ago, the company I work for was not offering any phone support channels and did not indicate they had any plans of implementing this in the future. Fast forward to 2022: earlier this year, my employer announced they would be implementing phone support but would start on a very limited basis with only select departments. They saw success with this, and recently, it was announced that they would be moving forward in making this a mandatory requirement for everyone in my role.If this was a part of the job when I first started, I would not have even applied. I have ADHD and have struggled with anxiety and depression for several years. These were only heightened during the pandemic - I deal with a lot of social anxiety now and struggle to keep up in conversation. This often results in momentary memory lapse, brain fog, and physical stuttering when engaging in ongoing verbal communication. I‚Äôve never wanted to work in phone support, but right now, I‚Äôm perhaps more ill-equipped to do this than I ever would have been prior to 2020. I acknowledge that this is detrimental and would like to work to improve this over time, but it‚Äôs not something that can be done abruptly without increasing my stress tenfold, and I have several other responsibilities outside of work that will suffer if my job causes me to panic every day. Overall, I really like the company I work for and it would be really difficult for me to switch employers at the moment, but the anticipation of this on top of several other changes has left me completely burnt out, anxious, and dreading work every day.In a recent meeting, my supervisor also noticed that this seemed to be causing me an abnormal amount of stress/anxiety and recommended I reach out to our HR team to inquire about potential accommodations, which was an option I‚Äôd never considered.HR informed me that in order to be eligible for accommodations I would need to have a Medical Certification Form completed by a physician or healthcare provider, and I‚Äôm honestly at a loss trying to figure out the best way to obtain this.My questions are these:1.) Due to some financial limitations, I‚Äôm not currently in therapy. I do have a general physician, but they can hardly even consistently get my medication prescriptions correct so I‚Äôm reluctant to go to them for anything (I‚Äôve been meaning to look for a new doctor, but truly just haven‚Äôt had the time). Would this be something my general physician would be able to write for me, or should I try and contact my last therapist (our last session was probably halfway through 2021).2.) I know some job applications require you to disclose whether or not you are ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù and in need of accommodation, which I usually decline because obviously, I don‚Äôt want that to impact my hireability. If I receive accommodation at this job, will I be required to disclose this to potential future employers as well?3.) Is this request reasonable? Imposter syndrome is absolutely at play here‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel like I can prove that these obstacles are enough to warrant accommodation, but simultaneously most days I truly believe I‚Äôd rather quit than go through with this. If I do, I‚Äôll be taking a big hit on my mental health which is the last thing I need right now. But if I decide to leave, I‚Äôll likely be taking a big hit on my financial situation instead."
[CO] Am I overreacting?,"Curious what you all think‚Ä¶ I work with all men, and I am a 25 y/o female. The lead/manager is 23 so not too much of a difference of age, and then my two other coworkers are over the age of 40.My lead/manager has been consistently on my case about things. I work hard and usually put my headphones on and get the job done. He‚Äôs been very distracting and attention seeking when it comes to me trying to do my job and is constantly making things difficult. Some examples are;flipping me off trying to be funny when I‚Äôve been listening to podcasts, so there hasn‚Äôt been much interaction.Pushing things that I‚Äôm working on almost tipping my project overAny time I have an idea to make things easier for us are pushed aside or ignored and I end up being made fun of for the suggestion.He‚Äôs been giving me all the more challenging jobs and I find that I‚Äôm asked to work harder then the other 2 coworkers I have.I understand as a leader you don‚Äôt have to listen to your subordinates, and essentially you are the one to watch over things are are not particularly the one who needs to do the job; when it comes to the way he is treating me as a leader himself am I over reacting or would it be worth discussing with the higher ups?"

Initially, I performed very well over achieving my targets and earnings lots of pay, then things went downhill and I couldn't perform, I don't know why.I was blasted at by my manager and eventually put on a PIP which I couldn't complete and I left the place before they could fire me.I joined a PE firm in a back-end role where I basically worked on decks, analytics, Billings etc. (Non-client facing work). After a year, apparently my performance wasn't up to par and I had to leave.Now, a common pattern in both the jobs was that I couldn't really figure out where I was going wrong..so i dunno...So, did I really fuck up things and I should have been more serious or I was not a fit with the culture at both the companies coincidentally???Any opinions??????"
[TX] Can someone help me understand my gross income?,"I make 43,419 a year I get paid bi weekly. Math was never my strong suit but I can‚Äôt seem to calculate my gross income that matches what Paycom has listed. My pre taxes pre benefits bi weekly pay checks. Can someone assist me with this?"
"[CAN] Rumor being spread about me and my cousin at work at we took off our shirts and were ready to beat a piece of shit co-worker, two particular co-workers have claimed that I have told them personally and are dead set on the story, how can I deal with this?","Alright so the story:Me and my cousin have been working at this one store for a long while now and there's this one stupid little shit of a merchandiser who feels like he has manager authority despite being at the store for less then a year, he is constantly pestering us as if he was a manager and he has finally got my cousin upset enough for him to speak to a real manager about this kid's attitude, the manager spoke to the little shit but he wasn't listening so my cousin and the manager both confronted him. After the confrontation this little shit has the audacity to say to my cousin ""7 years working here and you can't even be on time"". My cousin works harder then any of the other merchandisers and has more authority then some of the other managers, he comes late but he doesn't take break, so obviously this was quite a nerve stroke. My cousin began approaching the little shit but he wasn't going to hit him, he only wanted to get close to dare the little shit to say it to his face but our manager was behind him and held him back. The situation de-escalated and the little shit moped around for the remainder of the shift HOWEVER suddenly we get call from one of the managers, Trev, who are semi-close with the shit head and we have a conversation (Trev is the name I'll use for the rumor spreading manager), I know Trev is most likely the source of the rumors as certain things have been said to him in private that are also now part of the rumors. Anyways fast forward a few days things seem okay.. But then I get a call from the manager who held my cousin and she's telling me that two merchandisers approached her are claiming I told them ""me and my cousin both took off our shirts and were ready to beat this kid and quit."" The part about taking off the shirt was only ever mentioned to Trev, my cousin told him ""if things continue like this and you wont step up to the plate to fix it I wont mind taking off my shirt and quitting"" but now the rumor goes ""we took off our shirts and were ready to beat this kid's ass"" so we know he and the little shit twisted the story and started spreading rumors and somehow has these two merchandisers claiming I personally told them.I don't know what to do, I know my cousin is on the verge of exploding at these people and I don't want anything bad to happen, we work with one of the rumor spreading merchandisers tmr 4-10 and I don't want my cousin to blow up on him, there are cameras so I know if head manager wanted to investigate he could easily check the cameras and clear our names but the rumors being spread and the fact that now I am a bigger target because they claimed I personally told them makes this a lot harder to deal with, at least for me, if a fight breaks out I don't mind holding my ground but I am horrible with confrontation."
Peculiar Sentence in Offer Letter,"[NY] A full time offer letter (for a salaried position in the United States) includes a sentence ‚ÄúThe company may change your compensation from time to time at its discretion.""This seems odd to me as I haven‚Äôt seen this in previous offers from other companies.

[CA] Should I go to HR about a coworker who has created a toxic work environment?,"I work as a remote researcher in Indiana at my dream organization located in California.I used to love working where I work, but things started to go south once I joined a new team.On the team, there is a woman who we'll call ""Sarah"". She is known for being one of the best workers on our team (if not the best) but she is also very narcissistic and after getting to know her more, I'm beginning to realize that she's somewhat of a fraud and a bad person.Sarah and I became work ""friends"" pretty earlier on (I tried keeping my distance from her and keep things professional but I messed up and didn't have strong enough boundaries) and now I feel stuck in this ""friendship"" out of fear that she'll retaliate if I start to drift away or sever the relationship completely. She has already done this to someone on our team who she wasn't even that close with - her and another coworker used to talk everyday while they were in training; eventually he slowly stopped talking with her as often and now she talks shit about him and even sabotaged a chance for him to go to a conference with some of our other coworkers (she bad-mouthed him to organizer). All because she thinks he doesn't like her despite him being the nicest person on our team and never indicating that.I've been documenting some of the other things she's done which include:-Bad-mouthing literally every single person on our team (including our manager)-Publicly embarrassing our new manager by saying his idea was ""horrible""-Lied about the amount of work she got done (she said she completed something for me, but she never did)-Took credit for my work during a meeting I wasn't present at-Admitted to looking at another coworkers offer letter in AdobeSign (these are supposed to be confidential)"
"[IN] - Lied on CV & interviews about ""current"" job. Hired in Feb, fired in April. Before that I havent worked since July '21 due to mental illness hospitalization. After over 850 applications & 2mos from homelessness I risked lying hoping to slip through the cracks. Got hired. Bg check due tomorrow","PSUEDO - TLDRTuesday was my first day at my new corporate-type job and I have to consent to the background check by Wednesday. My dishonesty will come to light in the next few days and I will be questioned for it. I accept I will most likely be dismissed immediately once the verification investigation concludes. Despite this, I am reaching out to a few relevant subs asking for any and all advice, ideas, insights, etc. that might increase my chances of coming out on the other side of this still employed.I've been unemployed for 16 months. I have become desperate and willing to risk lying on the slim chance of slipping by background check employment verifications by using only people references ‚Äî either due to their process or individual HR incompetence / high workload.I knew it was a ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"" gambit. But after 16 months of no offers, draining my savings, maxing credit cards, raiding my retirement, destroying my credit, borrowing humiliatingly high amounts of money from family, having less than 2 months of expenses for surviving, deteriorating mental state, and close to losing my home and having to file bankruptcy, I felt like fuck it, why not, I‚Äôm not getting offers anyway.""It's easy enough to preach morality on a full belly.""After 14 years in my career, I never thought I'd be someone lying on their resume, and have chastised people in the past for doing so with easily-verifiable info like dates, degrees, etc. But rapidly approaching total financial destitution with no income for almost 2 years, going through a brutal divorce, and nearing another mental collapse, I have loosened my ethical lens to decide that yes, I will steal a loaf of bread to feed myself; the risk is worth it.My first attempt to return to work after my grippy socks hospitalization in February 2021, was in February 2022. It was a failure: I was dismissed promptly two months later in April 2022. This is the job I used as my ""current"" employer. That's six months of lies on top of the lie that I currently have a job.Prior to that, I was fired in July 2021 after 2 years of employment due to my admission to the psychiatric hospital that February because I exhausted my FMLA and PTO. This is where my life fell apart. Insurance limits meant I was released in May 2021 but unfortunately ended up there again in August 2021.I have tried my hardest to follow my own advice and treat finding a job as its own job. Since July 2021, I have applied for over 750 jobs with a few dozen interviews with over 1,000 ""engagement actions."" This includes applying, coffee chats with people who work at or have connections at companies I wanted to work at, interview homework assignments, round-robin or panel interviews, and networking events. This is both within my career and anything I could be remotely qualified for, including a ""survival"" job. I've also reached out to my local unemployment offices for help including career transitioning help since I've been losing hope that I can ever get hired in my field again. They‚Äôre completely overwhelmed and it‚Äôs been fruitless.I have worked non-stop without breaks since I was 16 and have been successful in my field for 14 years. The pride in my career, ethic, ambition, and character at work have been major parts of who I am. Getting fired twice for being unable to take care of myself for the first time in my life due to mental and emotional incompetence has been a ruinous blow to every facet of my life extending far beyond financial devastation."
[CA] told not to speak Spanish at work,"There is quite a long back story as to why I was told not to speak English by my supervisor. Firstly, the topic came across because my supervisor was already mentioning how she hates working at another site where the majority of the population speaks Arabic. She ended the conversation with ‚Äú-oh and by the way you and [coworker] can‚Äôt speak Spanish at your desks around other employees.‚Äù I was immediately taken aback and her opinion on employees speaking in another language was already making me feel uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt argue and just left but felt that what she said was not okay.Recently, an issue occurred between coworkers (that has nothing to do with me) and started when someone said something in Spanish and was asked to say it in English. It was very obvious the Spanish speaker was commenting on the other coworker, and the Spanish speaker did translate it to English. An argument came out of it, though I‚Äôm sure was never officially reported. Now, the non-Spanish speaking coworker is very close friends with my supervisor. Hence, my supervisor telling me not to speak Spanish. I‚Äôm sure the non-Spanish speaking coworker was also never reprimanded for a little stunt she pulled off after work (confronted the Spanish speaking coworker and yelled at her, was close to initiating a fight).I can see my coworkers argument being her excuse that she is only trying to make the environment comfortable for everyone, however I don‚Äôt think that was the correct way to go about it by prohibiting the use of a language while I‚Äôm sitting at my desk and conversing with other coworkers. Especially when half the workers speak Spanish and she made me feel uncomfortable stating how she felt about employees who don‚Äôt speak English at work.Seeing she‚Äôs only a supervisor to a large company, is she allowed to tell me not to speak Spanish?"
[WI] Can my employer do this? Please help.,"Hello all, and thank you to anyone who reads and responds.I put my 2 weeks notice into my employer last Monday as is professionally courteous to do. Tonight, while weightlifting I hurt my elbow pretty severely (I plan to go to urgent care tomorrow, I currently have low mobility and pain when flexing). I text my superior (who is also a friend) and told him that I wanted to use a sick day tomorrow which would be my last working day this week. He tried to strongly advise me against calling in saying that if I did so, my company would dig any and everything out of the woodwork to ""fire"" me so that they did not have to pay out my variable compensation or accrued pto for next year which could amount to a couple thousand dollars.I am not worried about losing out on the potential money, but if there is a way to avoid it that would be great as this was an incident I didn't mean to occur.My questions are as such.First, I guess is simply can they do that? I'm assuming they can since they know the loopholes, it seems unfair and it's not like I'm purposely trying to jerk the system, but I have a physical job and am in a fair amount of pain.Second, I am not anywhere near termination on our points system, if they forged that in a way that was used against me could I legally fight it?Third, is there any litigation at all that could protect me from them doing me wrong. I was a good employee, got good reviews and did my job well."
[CA] Leave of Absence options beyond FMLA,"In response to a surprise performance review from her manager and HR and to pre-emptively avoid a PIP conversation, my wife invoked FMLA and went on a caregiver leave for 3 months - to care for her ageing parents (with dementia).The 90 day FMLA is running concurrently with her Short Term Disability benefit of 180 daysThe FMLA ends next month and my wife has developed mental health issues related to stress about her parents‚Äô illness and her missing work and related duress. Question- 1. After FMLA ends can my wife immediately switch over to Short term disability and use up the remaining 90 days? And then if need be, can She move to long term Disability benefits ?

Non-Compete waived [TX],I was just released from my job and the company voluntarily let me out of the Non-Compete I signed.

"[NM] how do I deal with an employee with numerous ""life"" excuses - update","Not sure if updates are allowed? I can link the original if needed.I went back and forth on whether or not I should update.... But some interesting things developed and it felt like it needed it's own post, so here goes.Firstly, thank you to those who gave some really amazing reassurances, advice, and experiences. I knew this wasn't a spectacular or riveting situation, but the feedback was very helpful for me.The original update I was going to give was going to be somewhere along the lines of one commenter's person journey and how he turned himself around. It turns out, all his ""irrefutable excuses"" were verified fact. He did get delt at a few terrible cards from life at once and they had an impact on him in many ways.Last week, we had a solid conversation/discussion re-stating the expectations for his role. This summer he was hired to sell one product, then when I came on he was switched to learning a new product. Needless to say, he truly had been ""alone on his own island"", as we call it at work, for months before I came back on. He wasn't ""fully aware"" this sales switch was supposed to happen... and I find that hard to believe. Regardless, we re-calibrated. And he.. started performing? I was skeptical, but it was all looking on the up and up. And then, through some time, I started realizing more things. The ultimate realization was that we will be replacing him in the near future, but moreso because he chose to move on to a different occupation (he mentioned wanting to apply for a far more suitable job for him in conversation. Hey, man. You do you.).Sounds like a meh update, right? Why bother updating?And then I find out today what had happened yesterday...I get a PM from my boss on my way in to work that ""J is leaving at 1pm today to service his car before his RTO tomorrow."" And I simply responded ""OK then..."" He knows exactly what I mean by my response. AGAIN?! Another conveniently-timed out from work? And I get to pick up his duties? Fine. Whatever. The day is what it is.Today, it comes to light that J had a text altercation (vague for reasons) with a different dept's semi-coworker off the clock yesterday evening... We know some details, but not enough to comprehend any sort of ""why???"". This particular series of events is quite out of left field and we are all a bit whiplashed from it. He got himself fired.. this wasn't entirely how we all thought it would end. But, thank god.On a final note: My friends and I have seen a wide range of comers and goers in our industry. This one is just another one, really. And we all are going to have to live with never having any explanation at all as to why this one went out the way he did. Maybe one of these days I will actually write that book of all the different characters I've met in my travels...."
[NY] Hiring manager,"Any HR folks here? I applied for a high level job (think Associate > VP > MD > Partner) at a fortune 50 company a few days ago and just received an email from the hiring manager to chat about the role. I responded with some available times and he said he‚Äôd get back to me. Is this normal? I was expecting an HR rep to reach out, if at all, to do the typical screen call. The hiring manager stated they‚Äôd already seen my resume. Just looking for any insights. Thanks"
[NY] Promotion/Raise Shifting Goalposts,"I‚Äôve been working at a University that is the largest employer in our region for 10 years. I work in clinical research support. I‚Äôve been there the longest of my peer work group. I‚Äôve always received top reviews, and my boss has always remarked how invaluable I am. My skillset includes quite a bit of learned and institutional knowledge that would be hard to replace. I love my work group and have great interactions with my peers.For the past few years, my boss has wanted to promote me, to recognize the added duties I‚Äôve taken on and to help me grow in my career (my last promotion was in 2018). I requested that we push back the promotion during the height of the pandemic, as I wanted to focus on my current duties (often involving 12 hour days) and to hopefully be in a better position for a raise when the University wasn‚Äôt freezing expenditures.My boss has been working over the past year with HR to push my promotion through. For several months, the updates I received were that HR was just finalizing the last steps and it was on the last desk for sign off. A few months ago, my boss told me that she was trying to raise my job title two levels through the promotion. I was later told that HR refused to allow that. A little over a month ago, my boss told me that everything was nearly finalized and that my promotion would come with a 15% raise (she expressed that she had been trying for more than that).Today I touched base with my boss, as I‚Äôve been feeling strung along by HR. She told me that she was trying to fix things, but that HR had come back and refused to allow the 15% raise, as it would make me the highest paid person in my job classification in my department. She told me the latest range would be an 8-10% increase. She said that she would call new people at HR and try to fight for me.I‚Äôve been thinking about the situation, and honestly, I‚Äôm discouraged by the resistance and shifting goalposts from HR, especially as my boss has been the one fighting for me. As much as I love my work group, this resistance from HR is just adding to my burnout from the pandemic. I‚Äôm planning on talking to my boss to tell her that while I haven‚Äôt made any decisions, I am considering exploring the job market to see what salaries my skills and experience can get me. I know another department at the University has already informally offered me more than I would make with a 10% raise. I love my job, but I also have to think about my future.Is it a mistake to talk to my boss about my disappointment and discuss my thoughts about entering the job market again? Also, have you ever heard of HR departments pushing back so much when a supervisor is on board with a raise and promotion? Do you have any other advice on my next steps forward?Thanks!"
[MS] Can I get reprimanded for not meeting the standards of a job I didn‚Äôt want nor qualified for?,"During my interview with my current job, they told me what some of my duties would be which included user testing and technical writing. They already had my resume and I gave them examples of my web design work and more. The minimum qualifications didn‚Äôt require any programming, coding, etc. During the first week, I wasn‚Äôt really told about my duties but soon realized they placed me in a web development position; front-end to be specific. I spoke to my supervisor and she was confused with my placement too since she wasn‚Äôt included in the interview process to ask any technical questions. Basically, they confused web design with web development even though they planned on placing me in a technical writing position but when they heard web design, they decided I‚Äôd be best in the production area even though my skills were listed on my resume.When they realized what happened, they offered me a vacancy in a different division doing something I wasn‚Äôt interested in nor could physically do so then they told me they‚Äôd book classes for me to learn programming. A few weeks later, they said the classes weren‚Äôt in the budget so I tried learning from Google, YouTube, and other free resources. I just received my 6mo performance review and failed. Everything I was given that I could do wasn‚Äôt up to par due to lack of instructions and details even though I asked multiple times in person, email, and Teams. I did what I could with what I had. My supervisor said to get used to it because that‚Äôs how they unfortunately operate there. I added comments in my PR to make sure it was documented that this wasn‚Äôt the position I applied for and was not qualified for the position I was placed in.I‚Äôve been applying for new jobs but I also don‚Äôt want to get fired or written up for insubordination for not grasping JavaScript because of someone else‚Äôs mistake. Advice?"
[MA] Recently laid off HR internship due to ‚Äúbudgeting implications.‚Äù,"Starting off, I just want to apologize if this is in the wrong subreddit. In the beginning of September I had started a new HR internship at a mid-sized tech firm only to find out less than two weeks in, the HR business partner calls me into office stating ‚ÄúI have to lay you off due to budgeting issues.‚Äù I had even asked her if there were any issues on my part personally that I did wrong and she stated no, it‚Äôs just budgeting. I find out two days ago, that the same internship is listed on Glassdoor again which made my heart sunk. I had emailed her today regarding the position again and asked if I was laid off due to other reasons and that if I was, I would profoundly appreciate any advice on how to improve. My preceding two internships were at law firms and the HR setting was completely new for me but I still feel extremely sad because I feel like an idiot. Are internship lay offs normal and is it normal to fail at an internship as long as you learn from it? Any advice would help me, and once again sorry if this is in the wrong sub."
reaching out to runner up candidate [CA],"Tough choice between 2 candidates, and we made offer to one of them.

"[MI] When applying for jobs, does it hurt your chances if you confirm disability status?","I‚Äôve been applying to federally funded work opportunities, and they have a disability statement in which you can confirm, deny or opt out of answering. Having never applied to these types of positions before, I have never encountered this. Is this more of a statistics gathering question or is it reported on the application?The work is for federally funded universities.I have a chronic illness that qualifies as a disability and although it is chronic, it is well managed except for unpredictable flares that may require a sick day here or there that would be included in the benefits package. It would not prevent me from completing the duties of the position I applied for."

Like 60 seconds tops.Somebody will make reference to her quick bathroom break.She says ""oh yeah, I save time by not washing my hands when I pee.""And usually a few people will chuckle.I thought it was disgusting once but she's done it four times total now.She does it in meetings with C-suite executives and meetings with her direct reports.This woman is our VP of operations and has an MBA."
[NY] Applying to two different jobs at the same company and department?,"Hello,I've finished my final round of interviews to work at a dream company of mine. Initially I was expecting an offer last week, however, due to delays they said I should hear an update or next steps this week.I believe all the interviews went well and everyone was incredibly kind and friendly. So far, I have not heard back from them on the final decision yet, but I did notice they posted a similar (but different) job in the same department.I was wondering if it would be appropriate to apply for this second job with the same team given that I have not received an answer yet.Titles are both at the same senior level, the only difference is the specific operational focus of the position. I qualify well for both.I'd just like to hedge my bets by having the second job as a backup in case I don't get selected for the first one."
"[OH] Reasonable Accommodation, medical termination, disability retirement?","Lots of questions below, hoping someone has answers.I don't trust my leadership; they are only out for themselves and don't care about employees. It's a toxic work environment and it has affected my health. Anyhow, I ask these questions here because my ""chain of command"" are not there to help nor guide. They barely do their own work, so I have little expectation from their end. Anyhow...As a federal employee & a service-connected veteran, I've been on intermittent FMLA+leave all year (as I've done for the last 5yrs). It's been worse this year so I was out more often and now I've used up my FMLA before renewal time, and I'm out of leave. Since my leadership needed bodies/coverage this year, I would do remote-work to help and they've had me to work from home since March.With my FMLA running out for the year, I applied for Reasonable Accommodation (RA) in early Sept to continue doing remote work since I have issues being out of my home. My doctor provided their letter, and everything's done on my end. My leadership claims they don't have remote work available, even though I've been doing just that for them most of the year since they needed coverage. (Leadership lied to the RA and stated I hadn't worked all year, until I mentioned that I had paystubs & everything I do requires secure access/logs, proving I've been working from home all this time. Freaking jerks... See why I don't trust my leadership??)Anyways, they weren't able to find me a position that works with my reasonable accommodation, and so I'm at the stage where I have to sign an ""Employee Limitations on Reassignment Options"" form so they can continue looking for a position I can do, even if the position pays less, is in another location, part-time instead of full time, etc. (They have 40 days from the time I sign the form.) What I found odd was that the RA stated that if they couldn't find anything, I'd be ""removed from federal gov't"". I assume she meant medical termination, but that's not what her notification states.Meanwhile, I'd be on Leave Without Pay for the duration. I've already been without pay since Sept, and now I'm gonna continue being without income for the next 40 days..? I can't afford letting my mortgage go like that, or any of the other bills.What is a medical termination? How does that affect future employment?What are my options at this point? I didn't want to sign the form without knowing what I'd be signing away.And what happens if they can't find a position and the 40 days are up? What then?And ""removed from federal govt"" meaning what exactly, I can't get a job at all with the govt even if it's a different agency?And during this 40-day period, can I accept employment from elsewhere so I'm not broke/homeless, at least until I hear back from them? (I have a feeling they won't find a position for me.)Will being able to find employment elsewhere hurt my case any, even if the job is remote/work-from-home per my Reasonable Accommodation request?"
[TX] New Boss,Well it looks like a lot of changes are coming my way. My coworker left the company a few months ago and I‚Äôm also getting a brand new manager. Any tips during this transition?

[PA] How to begin the ADA process?,"EDIT: I'd like to add that I LOVE my job, I love working, and I spent my entire leave last year working hard to get better. I know fibromyalgia has a big stigma, but I can promise you I challenge it every day. I just want to make sure my job is protected if I take extra days beyond my sick time.(Unpaid is fine)I‚Äôm a teacher in PA, and this is my 4th year at my school, but I unfortunately do not qualify for FMLA at this time. I have a chronic condition (fibromyalgia) that impacts my entire life.Last year, I went on medical leave for the entire school year starting in November 2021. I intended to come back sooner, but treatment and additional diagnoses took longer than expected. I‚Äôm doing MUCH better now, but due to the nature of my condition, I can‚Äôt predict nor promise that I won‚Äôt use all of my sick days (which isn‚Äôt much to start with) this year.Additionally, I was (unsurprisingly) denied long-term disability in April after applying in December 2021. At the end of this month, I‚Äôm finally going to court for my disposition as the final step for my appeal. That in a sense should ‚Äúprove‚Äù that my condition is considered a disability, correct?I‚Äôve had intermittent FMLA each school year besides my first, but due to last year‚Äôs leave, I won‚Äôt qualify until next year. Can ADA protect me in the meantime by allowing me to have intermittent leave?Thank you in advance for any help."
[ND] Can my current employer find out if I have accepted another position if I don't tell them?,"Okay, so my current employer recently notified us that we are being laid off in November due to our client not renewing their contract with the company. They are offering a retention bonus to those of us who decide to stay through the contract end date in November, but they have placed eligibility requirements on that retention bonus. One of those requirements is that we cannot accept another job offer until after our employment has been terminated.So here's my question:I obviously have been job hunting and just accepted a new position with another company. They are willing to work with me on my start date so that I am able to work through the contract end date with my current employer. If I just don't tell my current employer that I've accepted another offer, can they still find out and revoke my retention bonus? The only thing that concerns me is that the new company is completing a background check as part of their pre-employment process and I'm worried that they will contact my current employer and they will find out that way. Am I overthinking this? I obviously don't want to keep working for my current employer if they aren't going to pay me the retention bonus, so I don't know what to tell the new employer with regard to my start date.Thanks in advance for your input!!"

[AL] What is taking so long to approve the job?,"I applied to an accounting role at an engineering firm in my area at the beginning of August. A few days later the hiring manager called me and set up an interview for a week or so later. I went to the interview mid-August and it seemed like it went well. The senior accountant that was interviewing me seemed to like me and showed me around the office. I asked her when they would make a decision and they said the end of the month. September rolls around and I call asking about the position, and they say they‚Äôre still interviewing. Two weeks later I call and I‚Äôm told they‚Äôre waiting for the job to be approved. Last week I called and it‚Äôs still not approved. This is a reputable company with 2000 employees so I know things wouldn‚Äôt move overnight but I‚Äôm worried they rejected me without telling me outright. HR managers, is this length of time time normal for hiring. Am I being impatient or is it a red flag that the job has been closed? I really want to work here and feel like I‚Äôm a perfect fit so I‚Äôm just curious as to what‚Äôs taking so long."
[NH] How Best to Handle Mental Health Disclosure with Work,"Trigger warning: mental health issues discussedI recently learned a family member may suffer from bipolar disorder. According to spousal confirmation, symptoms have been noticeable for years -- but nothing was ever disclosed to family, friends or any previous / current employers. More to the point, this issue was never addressed with a licensed medical practitioner.This family member recently began a manic episode, with symptoms ranging from delusional thinking / grandiose ideation, lack of focus, non-stop verbal spinning on tangential topics, forgetfulness, high energy, easy distraction, difficulty sleeping, the works. There is cohesiveness for prolongs periods, but it is not consistent and gets interrupted frequently by the manic symptoms. From my understanding, this type of thing has happened before -- but never to this extent and never over prolonged time periods.My family member fully recognizes everything currently happening is not normal and that it all needs to be addressed medically. There has been nothing but full cooperation shown to all the support offered and received. To this end, a trip was taken to an Emergency Room for a psych evaluation.The difficulty of American health system assistance with mental issues, however, is that everything is a slow series of steps. Step 1 includes getting baselines, ruling out medical / chemical reasons for current symptoms and determining potential for violence; Step 2 is getting on the calendar of an actual Psychiatrist for a full / proper evaluation, etc. It is a system ill-prepared to handle someone troubled but not in need of a mandatory loss of freedom for the protection of others.When this manic episode began, my family member had the presence of mind to inform a supervisor they were feeling unwell and needed to stay home. Sick time was used to cover days taken off during that week. As we round the corner into the second week of this issue, vacation days are currently being used until symptoms dissipate -- but no one knows if or when that will happen. This health issue provides nothing but uncertainty for everyone involved.Because my family member is an established remote worker with over a decade of experience and accolades with an progressive organization, there have been no questions about the lost time raised by the employer. One would assume this stance will change if once established deadlines start being missed or lost time becomes a problem.The caretaking team needs to understand, from an HR perspective, how best to address work during this crisis. Until there is an established medical prognosis (the ER triage is not the same as a fully psychological evaluation), it doesn't feel like there's anything we can say -- and once the issue is documented, there's still nothing from stopping an employer from releasing an at-will employee without cause. My family member also has rights as a patient to not disclose this issue, but if something doesn't change soon there will be inevitable consequences.This person maintains a role as sole monetary provider in a marriage with kids. It's understood by everyone involved in this support effort that a loss of employment means a loss of income for a family -- and the removal of health insurance so desperately needed in a moment like this.Any direction that can be provided regarding how best to address a place of work in the midst of these kinds of mental health crisis circumstances are much appreciated."
[CA] Paid family leave proof of relationship,My husband wants to take a few weeks of PFL for baby bonding when we have our daughter.

[MN] What is the HR investigation process if I submit complaints of bullying?,"I work for a small startup and am the acting director of my department. For the past 12-14 months, I have been subjected to what I now understand to be bullying, gaslighting and gossiping by our CEO. I wrote out every major incident I could remember over the past year and planned to share my experiences with the HR independent contractor that we use.I called last week to give the HR contractor a heads up that I would like to discuss some things, and gave them a general outline of what I wanted to talk about, without specific examples. I did use the words ""bullying, gaslighting and intentionally excluding and dividing employees."" The HR contractor told me that they would have to begin an immediate investigation, based on the language I was using, which would start as soon as we have an official meeting about it.My questions are: Is the HR contractor correct in that this sounds like cause for official investigation? What does that investigation process look like? Who is involved? My anxiety is through the roof right now due to constantly being subjected to the CEO's behavior, so I am contemplating whether this is worth going through the process or if I should just leave."
Question About Requested Time Off [CA],"I recently started a job and I requested some time off 19 days in advance and my boss said he‚Äôll fix the schedule, I even put a note on the days I requested on his desk. I came into work yesterday and saw that 2/3 days I requested off are now scheduled days. What should I do if he didn‚Äôt approve it even though I asked twice, a week before I saw this schedule. For context, when he said he‚Äôll ‚Äúfix it‚Äù I bought and set up airline tickets that day if not the day before.So basically I requested days off, he said he‚Äôll ‚Äúfix it‚Äù so I then bought tickets and set everything up and now a week later I come to see that the scheduled has me working on 2/3 days I requested off.Advice? Thanks!I can keep you guys updated as well!"
Time card responsibility [TX],"I just need a quick sanity check because I'm pretty sure this policy is not legal.If an employee doesn't clock out (either because they forgot or the system glitched) whose responsibility is it to resolve the punches?If the employee does not jump through the correct hoops to submit a time clock edit, is it legal to process it as a ""1 minute shift"" and make them jump through more hoops to get it fixed on their next check?"
[VA] Poor performance due to mental health and family,"How much do I talk about my family struggles with my boss, in my new job, where I am already struggling? And what can I expect from them moving forward?I applied to and was hired for a job at a large consulting firm that is definitely above my level of expertise. The pay and flexibility are great, so I want to do what I need to keep the job. Some of the stuff my colleagues are able to do, well, it's beyond me. I figured that with time, I could at least learn some of it, and maneuver my way to a different position if needed, and at worst, make them fire me. So far, I've been doing so-so, probably below average. There is no way I will get another job with this pay or flexibility without more experience and expertise. It's my first big girl job, so there is also some naiveness on my part here. Also, I have ADHD.Here's the family stuff. My mother was diagnosed with late-stage cancer a few months ago and is near the end. This has added to everything of course. My supervisor is aware, but I don't know if I should keep mentioning it at our weekly connects. I am emotionally and mentally worn out. My masking skills have been slipping. I've said things to her, while not rude, that are just a tad less tactful than they should have been. I have made small mistakes in simple client projects and am sensing some tension from my supervisor. It feels like I've slipped from so-so to barely hanging on. Not sure how much is in my head. To make things even worse, she is just not a structured type of person. She is very ""you're a professional, I will not micromanage you"". So I don't get much feedback, even when I ask for it.I am not sure if I will be fired, get a warning, or what will happen.What would you advise I do? What is likely to happen? How much should I play up or avoid discussing my family issues?"
[TX] HR gave misleading/questionable info on FMLA and STD leave‚Ä¶.,"I have a fairly serious chronic health condition. I‚Äôve been with my job for close to 1.5 years and have managed working full time well, but my symptoms have really flared lately to the point I need medical leave. I also have STD coverage through my employer.I brought up my need for leave with my supervisor last week and had a phone chat with HR about my options. Both were very supportive and my HR rep advised I would likely qualify for both FMLA and STD. HR provided me with forms and encouraged me to see my PCP asap. I then got a bit of sassiness/rudeness from upper management on my team - but I get it, having people out can be rough.However, after the weird stuff from upper management I received an email from the same HR rep with completely different and somewhat misleading/false advice-‚ÄúUnfortunately based on what you have shared with me yesterday regarding your chronic health condition that you mentioned was diagnosed in 2019, I do not believe that you currently qualify for a short-term disability leave or FMLA leave. If after seeing your doctor next week there is additional diagnosis or treatment plan please let me know and I can help you through the leave request process if your doctor feels you are unable to work. However without a medical document supporting your request for time off  to deal with your health we are unable to move forward‚ÄùFrom what I understand chronic conditions are clearly covered under FMLA? I read a chronic condition is defined as one you‚Äôve sought treatment for at least twice in the last year, which I meet. I also called the insurance company and discovered that chronic conditions are covered by STD after a 12-month waiting period, which I also satisfy.In any case- I saw my doctor today (as the HR rep originally advised- I was so confused by the email‚Äôs end as we had already discussed I would need documentation) and he‚Äôs fully supportive to sign off for FMLA and STD. So the point is kinda moot- I‚Äôm going to get my leave and hopefully my disability. Im just feeling a little icky about this. I work for a company that loves to tout its great benefits and human-centric culture. This experience honestly makes me feel discouraged from returning to the company after my leave.So AskHr, what should I do? Of course, I could do nothing- I‚Äôm going to get the leave I  need. I just find 2 things really unethical: the change in advice that seems to have been influenced by managerial needs, and that that advice is misleading/bordering on false. Should I file an internal or external complaint? Something else? Just feeling icky and kinda bummed that this experience has made me not want to return to a job I‚Äôm good at and previously enjoyed :("
[CA] HR Investigation - Investigated Party Translates for Co-Party,Apologies for the title. We have a complaint that a manager was giving preferential treatment to an employee because they are involved in a sexual relationship with each other. The manager being accused  is our only bilingual manager and the employee allegedly canoodling only speaks Spanish. The owners are planning on having the manager translate the interrogation with the employee. This is not a good idea obviously. Can anyone give me any advice on what would be a better solution?
[IL] Am I allowed to have a 3rd party witness during my meeting tomorrow?,"Hi all, I could really use some help before I go into work tomorrow. To make a long story short, my boss would like to meet with me to try to steamroll, for a third time now, working two Sundays from now during the am shift. I don't work Sundays period- I haven't in 7 years and she knew this before she hired me, along with the fact that I wear skirts period. I attend church faithfully, and she's respected it up until now. I requested off and RSVP'd for a close friend's wedding months ago and, due to a combination of extenuating circumstances and poor planning, she's saying I can't get it off unless I agree to work Sunday.The problem is, with how she responded to my text reply to her (I said I would think about it), I do not feel even remotely comfortable sitting in a meeting with just her with how hostile she was. I was shaking after the exchange was over, partially because she said she didn't want to discuss this over text, sent two more messages, and then tried to call me. All while I was on the clock (I sent the initial answer on my break). By Illinois state or federal law, aren't I allowed to have a neutral third party witness for this meeting? Unfortunately Illinois is NOT a one party consent state, so I could get in hot water for recording the exchange, which is why I want someone else in there with me. I tried to compromise with her by saying I would work a full shift that Thursday already (my other regular day off) no problem, but she tried to say that Thursday would be overtime because, ""You will be working Sunday, if you want the wedding off. I don't know what else to tell you."" Another big reason I want a witness or, if I'm mistaken about laws a recording, is because I'm worried it's going to be a he-said, she-said argument if she tries to retaliate over this. She's already made at least 2 blatently discriminatory comments in the text exchange, and I'd like to be able to document whatever else she says in the heat of our ""discussion"" tomorrow."
[FL] Missing Pay,"Good afternoon,I am hoping I may be able to ask for your advice.BACKSTORY: Around Sept 26th, my husband and I were talking about how short on finances we were. This prompted us to review our bank accounts vs our paystubs.I have been having for the previous month 200 deposited into two of my accounts, and then the remaining going into my husband's account to pay bills.When he checked his account, he noticed that he was only getting 300, he apparently knew the three hundred but didn't question it as he thought it was coming to my accounts.we looked at the first paystub and it should have been 1,127.02, however only 700 was direct deposited. they are stating a check was sent out for 427.07the second paystub should have been 1097.24, However only 700 was direct deposited and a ""check"" was mailed out for 397.24.At this time, we figured out that my work has been sending checks to the address we lived at last year. As soon as we moved, I updated the address.I redid all of our back account info on my end JUST IN CASE. This was done the Friday before pay.I contacted HR, filed a missing pay ticket and waited."
[KY]How to address issues with management team?,"In my office we have a supervisor scheduled 8-2:30 for 2 days a week and she works one 12 hour shift as well. After being at this job a few years she‚Äôs recently been promoted to supervisor. Lately, she has taken a relaxed position. She will NOT educate anyone on the team when issues arise because she doesn‚Äôt want to work the hours. Our office operates 24/7 and she will not address issues with night shift because of her hours. The director will also not do any education. My supervisor continuously sends out a generalized email anytime something happens and adds harder protocols /stipulations to the entire team. Since i have been there the longest aside from my supervisor she makes me educate team members but they will not listen to me. I have reported issues time and time again. Aside from this, i feel i know my job well. However, anytime someone makes a complaint to my supervisor she will take note of it and tell the complainer that ‚Äúshe will educate‚Äù said person that made the mistake. She will then get off the phone and tell this person they did what they were supposed to do. She does not investigate these claims or address any issue. She‚Äôs become inconsiderate by Permanently taking over another person‚Äôs desk and not notifying them this past week. This desk is always in use by the same 2 individuals. She left for an appointment before the next person arrived and left her personal belongings there. I did not get into that drama but I have been put in the position to listen to every complaint. I had to recommend to those individuals that they talk to her or the director. They took away our part time position that usually helps during busy hours because ‚Äúour staff was being made to go home early too much‚Äù. Our supervisor is the only person in the office that leaves early. Everyone else works a full shift and gives report to the next person. Therefore we do not have the option to leave early. Everyone in the office has all realized the problems but will not speak up because our supervisor is very close with our director. When i have brought up issues, during meetings with the team and one-on-one talks with the director and supervisor, I‚Äôve been demeaned in-front of the team and separately. Told that if I‚Äôm unhappy i should leave. I‚Äôm at my whits end. I have set boundaries stating i will not educate other employees on serious matters or anything more than generalized training. I‚Äôve kept my head down and due to corporate marketing adjustments i have just started making a living wage. I know I can‚Äôt fix it but I‚Äôm at a stand still. I‚Äôm getting reported for doing my job properly but get reprimanded by other managers for the same issue multiple times eventhough i have done nothing wrong according to my managers."
[CA] HR never came back for my I-9 identification documents after 3 months and I'm still missing one. What problems can arise?,When I was employed my driver's license was one month expired and my passport was stolen when my car got broken into (I reported it as stolen already).  I thought my parents had my SSN card and Birth Certificate but they couldn't find it either (at the time).  HR said it would be fine for now if I give them my expired license + receipt of renewal and an e-receipt of me ordering a new SSN card and provide them my real documents later (never specified when).When I Google'd my situation it seemed like I had 3 months to do so.It's been almost 4 months now and HR hasn't gotten back to me yet about my documents.  I received my birth certificate and SSN card from my parents since it turned out they had it after all but my renewed license was lost in the mail so I recently went to the DMV to request a replacement + REAL ID.Are there any repercussions I might face for not providing this yet?  Should I bring it up to HR or should I just wait and see?
[CAN] How should I handle my raise being delayed?,"So I hit my 1 year at a new job a few months ago and asked for a raise at the same time.

It's been almost another 2 weeks with no updates at all. Should I be worried about this / should I confront my boss about what's going on?"

Yes, I know there are options to spend it ‚Äì I would rather just get the money back.

Sexual harassment [NC],"Hi everyone I needed to ask a serious question. I experienced sexual harassment for a year and a half from my supervisor, it‚Äôs a really long story which I plan to make a post for later on. I did bring it up to HR and she ended up telling me that I lied and was going to write me up but instead she said she wanted to counsel me. Recently another employee has come to me about the same person sexually harassing them. This employee has gone to HR for other employees speaking to her inappropriately but she has not gone to HR for this particular person. He harassed me sexually for over a year and now he is harassing other women in the workplace. My question is do I have the right to tell HR what she expressed to me and other employees.? I would really appreciate everyone‚Äôs advice thank you."
"[SWEDEN] I‚Äôm not sure if this is harassment or not, should I bring it up to my manager?","I was redirected here, so I‚Äôm basically crossposting this with some added details.Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. For context, I moved here from another country alone for work about a year ago. I got assigned a mentor as I‚Äôm a junior in my field. I‚Äôm also FTM, but I‚Äôm not out at work yet, so they know me as a woman. I feel like that‚Äôs important to mention considering the context.When I first got to work, there wasn‚Äôt much work that me and my mentor could do together, as I was working on things that were out of his expertise. He kept on trying to meet up with me, or arranging meetings. I understand that‚Äôs pretty normal for mentors, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. However, he started to get more forceful about it, and would visibly seem quite annoyed when I refused them. He insisted on them happening at some point, despite that the things I was working on, he was unable to help with. Nevertheless, I let it go, because I just figured he was trying to help.His behaviour has got more erratic, though. We have an office that lots of people take off shoes, as it‚Äôs pretty normal to take off shows when you go indoors. One of the times I went to the office, he got super close to me and started rubbing his bare foot? Which I don‚Äôt need to explain how uncomfortable that made me lol, but he also might just have been doing it absentmindedly. He‚Äôs still insisting on talking to me about nothing to do with work, which is fine, but given previous behaviours it honestly makes me very uncomfortable.Now I have taken up a task that will require some help. I put my name down for it, and I‚Äôve just found out, so has he. I get that‚Äôs normal for mentors to do, but I just feel kinda cornered into working with him. He hasn‚Äôt helped me at all since getting here, and in fact has made many aspects more confusing. I‚Äôve communicated that his way of working doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping, but he‚Äôs insistent.I get along with the rest of my team perfectly fine, but this guy is honestly really affecting my working life. I understand that he‚Äôs a mentor that‚Äôs maybe concerned that he hasn‚Äôt been able to actually help me much thus far, but he is extremely overbearing. The foot rubbing incident honestly creeped me out, especially since he did it right next to me and was looking at me. It didn‚Äôt feel sexual, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. I‚Äôm concerned that bringing it up will make a whole thing out of nothing, so I haven‚Äôt. However, working with this guy is making me genuinely not want to go to work, and I‚Äôm actively looking elsewhere.Another thing that‚Äôs stopping me from going to my manager already is he honestly seems like he might have some learning difficulties that he doesn‚Äôt understand social queues. I know that doesn‚Äôt excuse what he‚Äôs been doing, but it might explain things.Now for what the title is: is this harassment? Should I bring it up with my manager? Or should I just accept it and move on?EDIT: To add, this is not my first mentor in this field, so I have an idea about how things work and don‚Äôt work for me. I also do as he says most of the time to save myself from any sort of conflict, but I‚Äôm getting to the end of my tether and would like to figure out the best way forward. Let me know if you need any more info."

[NC] USA - What does it mean?,"[NC] The following scenario occurred in North Carolina, USA. What, if anything, does it mean when a potential employer calls a former employer to confirm employment and the HR manager says ‚Äústart date xx/xxxx. termination xx/xxxx. Then they slam down the phone. Is this a way of conveying they don‚Äôt recommend hiring the person? I ask because before leaving previous employment, I filed a sexual harassment complaint about my manager. I knew from other employees that complaints had been filed by others. HR even confirmed this when we discussed it. They wanted me to continue working with him while they investigated. I told them I wasn‚Äôt willing to do that and was moving out of state soon anyway. They said ok, so I quit that day. Anyway, I applied for another job and this is how the employment inquiry was responded to. Is using the word termination and slamming the phone code for do not hire or was the HR director likely just in a bad mood?"

I was tasked with removing it, but I don't see where flag reviews for removal on our glassdoor account? I have contacted glassdoor (will be a week tomorrow) and have no response about how to remove.If we remove this post and the employee (or ex-employee) tries to out the person they referred to, am I legally liable for any damages?

That I feel is the more ethical thing to do, but I don't know what carries the greater risk.UPDATE: Now I'm being asked to find the person who posted this. Is that even legal or possible? Will glassdoor turn over their emails as my operations director requested? I don't know how to handle this request as I think it's either illegal or impossible to fulfill."
[GER] Need help/suggestions/opinion- sick leave,"Hi, I am an employee in desperate need of a suggestion from an experienced HR. I work in a big corporation, and I am literally scared to ask HR in the company I work for, since I feel I will not get a candid answer. The thing is: I got burnout, and depression. It is very difficult for me to work now: I either look at the screen and am not able to work, or (depending on the day/moment) I can do some work, but extremey slow. I am normally slow (although good :-) ... I just need more time than usual) but now that I am not well, the thing is off the chart. I would benefit from an extended sick leave - and I would have no probem getting it since my doctor has known me and treated me for depression for years) but I am literally terrified, since I dont want to be put in a box of a weak person, mentally unable to be given responsibility work, etc. Besides, I feel shame and it would be embarassing for me to go back to work and look my colleagues in the eye. Work has always been important for me and despite my ""handicap"" w depression, I had a good albeit not super, career and I feel I have contributed to the good of the companies I worked for.  So, showing that I just cannot work now feels terrible.I thought about an alternative solution: ask for a time reduction like working few hours...maybe in that way, I would be able to do some work (maybe I will need 40 hours to do a 20 hours workload, but ok...) and, as I see it, a time reduction will not be seen as bad and will lead to much less corridor rumors. I actually dont know whether I will be able to work, even fewer hours, but I can try. The drawback is that the company always accept a worktime reduction request, but not always will give back the normal worktime once the person asks it back (which would be hard for e economically). The other drawback is that I would not be able to really switch off and recover.So you see, I don¬¥t know what to do. And the stress of this decisions just adds up onthe stress I already have due to my situation. I hope you can help me giving to me your opinion. Thanks for reading !"
[NY] Follow up question,"Hi. So a week ago, I asked a question in this sub and I was helped so thank you. But I have a follow up question. The HR dept got back to me and stated their investigation was closed. The person was fired and they will be sending me a letter detailing their investigation and proof he was fired. I just want to know if this is normal. I heard this is unusual and they don't normally tell you when the investigation is wrapped up.This has been alot for me and I just want to know if I should expect and blowback and if this is normal."
l[AR] Not Acquiring PTO,"For the last 6 months I have been working full time and should‚Äôve been receiving PTO hours to use later.The company failed to change my status from part time to full time and thus never granted me a single hour of PTO.Is there anything that can be done here, or am I screwed on this one?"

[CA] Friend called into HR for Training with ulterior motive,"Asking for a friend but this person was called to meet with HR under the auspices of a training session. When my friend went to the session it turned out to also be an investigation into an alleged incident of discrimination. My friend is a quiet person and doesn't really interact with anyone at work minus me and his direct supervisor. I've known this person for a while as we have met outside of work and have actually worked together in the past and I can attest that this person would be the last person to discriminate against another person.My friend was shaken after the incident. After the session he found out that his job position was posted on a couple of job boards. Timeline wise it was posted on the day before he was informed about the ""training"" session at HR by his manager.My question is what are possible end results in this situation? I want to calm my friend down but all that's running through his head is that he will be fired soon. Do HR investigations normally create a job listing in preparation for finding some sort of cause for termination or does it really depend on the employee?No issues with performance or tardiness. In fact he goes above and beyond for his job very consistently if that's a factor.Any advice would be appreciated."

"[IL] Unproductive Employees Finally Being Held Accountable and Screaming ""BULLY!""","Unproductive Employees Finally Being Held Accountable Reporting me as a Bully - ILLINOISHi everyone I wanted to explain a situation I'm in and see if anyone can offer advice. This has really been bothering me and so I truly appreciate any insight here.So I work in a pretty stressful environment in a retail setting. I'm a supervisor during my shift when my manager isn't there which is usually only about half of my shift. I am not a manager, but when my mgr isn't present I lead the team of 4-5.One thing I've realized is my manager who's these peoples' actual boss is extremely non confrontational. She does not like to have difficult conversations with subordinates and usually ends up picking up their slack. They get away with doing 70% of their job when working with her because they know they won't be held accountable. She's actually really nice to them as well. Overall, she's just an extremely nice person and very hard-working.Now about me... I'm not so nice in all honesty. Sure, I am kind and I care about others. I don't have any pre conceived notions about protected classes or any specific employee. As of lately, though, I have been trying to hold them accountable.I believe they ask me questions they already know the answer to in an attempt to get me to just do their work for them. So I've been more short and condescending when they ask me these questions. I don't laugh and joke with them and I am literally trying to show them I am not their friend and I don't care to make small talk. I just want to do my job, supervise them doing theirs, and go home. That's it.I'll admit as well my tone is pretty rude (knowingly to get the point across I'm not happy with their laziness). I also demand things of them without asking politely like I used to. I am generally pretty stand-offish and act like I'm above them, because I am.I know I sound like a major asshole but this is only me at work. When I work with other teams who are accountable and productive I get along with everyone great.Recently 3 of the 4 of them got together and reported me to HR and my boss' boss. An investigation occurred in which case they read me statements made my TM's that were completely out of context. They failed to mention their laziness, lack of productivity, and accountability. When HR was reading the statements it painted me in a light as of I'm a bully for no reason. I know they don't like me. I'm rude and I won't pick up their slack.Now I'm worried for my job. What can I expect? Please ask for more details if needed and I'm happy to share. I know for certain I did not discriminate against a protected class, but yes, I am pretty rude and short with them and no I don't like any of them..."
[MS] Any reason why a company would not differentiate between supervisor and manager?,"I work in a community clinic with about 400 employees. I‚Äôve looked at so many job descriptions and I notice there is no discernible difference between supervisor and manager positions. Above that are directors and chiefs, below that are individual contributors and maybe leads. The HR person literally said there is no difference. But why?"
"Promised a sign-on bonus with a signed agreement, then tells me I‚Äôm not eligible? [MI]","I started a salaried job a little over a month ago and during my onboarding I was told I would get a sign-on bonus that would be broken up in payments starting with the first  30 days. I emailed HR after the 30 days to check if I will still be receiving my bonus (on my upcoming paycheck) and was told she checked with corporate and I would not be eligible for a bonus. She did not notify me of this at all until I had asked her. I also had a signed agreement that had my signature, HR‚Äôs signature, and my supervisor‚Äôs signature. I ended up asking my supervisor about it as I had forgot she had signed it too. Turns out, she was not aware of any kind of agreement and that signature was written without her permission. I was able to contact my HR‚Äôs boss, and was told that it was a mistake. My supervisor told me she also talked to the HR‚Äôs boss and nothing had come from it. They only acknowledged that they did not go about it the right away and will make sure this does not happen again. I don‚Äôt even care about the bonus. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. It‚Äôs not my problem that I was promised something (WITH a signed agreement) without them even verifying if it was applicable to me. My question is, what can I do going forward? I‚Äôm a little concerned about the signature forgery on my supervisor‚Äôs behalf, but I do not believe she would take any action against them at this time."
[AU] Should I be worried about my drunken behaviour?,"To give background I'm in a intership program for a couple of years there is about 10 of us in all different areas of the business.We try and do some stuff outside of work together and this night we went out for food and drinking not all of us drank I was one of the few who did drink and got very drunk. I ended up kissing one of the guys who was sober on the top of his as a little joke bare in mind that U would say his social skills arent the greatest.Fast forward to when we're working in the office and at the some stage during the day he came up behind me and kissed me on the top of my head unexpectedly.Now I know my actions silly and as much as I regretted doing it, it wouldn't really bother me if it was outside work hours but during work hours it did. I was just curious if my drunken behaviour outside of work hours should be toned down a little so I don't do anything stupid like that again."
Qualifying life event - when will coverage end? [CA],"My domestic partner is on my health insurance. She's started a new job and is eligible for benefits on 10/1 for her new company so I will be removing her from my plan. My company charges me a premium on 9/23 and 10/7. They told me to put in a QLE for 9/30 to ensure I don't get charged again on 10/7 (this all happened before 9/23). The insurance provider says coverage ended on 9/30, but I was charged the bimonthly premium on 9/23. I would think this would cover her at least through 10/14 or potentially the full month.Is this normal? Is there any way to get a pro-rated premium refunded? I essentially paid for 2 weeks of insurance and only received 1 week's worth. Thanks!location: [CA]"

[CA] Rumor that a new employee was in the adult industry,"I overheard a guy say (in crass terms) a relatively new female employee might have done adult films, followed by another guy saying 'haha I bet'.  Personally it doesn't change my professional opinion of her, but that's a pretty awful rumor to be spreading in my opinion.I feel like she should know people are saying that about her behind her back, but I wouldn't tell HR because it could get her fired, I don't want to tell her myself because that could get reported to HR, and doing it anonymously is creepy.  Should I try to notify her somehow or just leave it alone?Edit: I forgot to mention I'm only like 70% sure on who the guys were. It was at a ~100 person division meeting made of mostly generic late-thirties white dudes I barely know."
Ethical dilemma [UK],"Hi‚Ä¶ UK based and need some advice. I applied for a role at another firm and was successful. As I was working out my notice period I was put through a disciplinary procedure and ultimately fired. My employer has a basic reference policy and has said they will provide basic references going forward. They‚Äôve also said I shouldn‚Äôt let my new employer know about my situation and instead should focus on the future. I‚Äôm uncomfortable, as I feel like I should tell my new employer what‚Äôs happened (the accusations were pretty serious, I made a mistake at work that I shouldn‚Äôt have) but at the same time worried that I‚Äôll lose my future employment at some point if they find out. I‚Äôm worried that an employee who was part of the same process may try to sabotage my new role by contacting my new employer directly‚Ä¶. what should I do?"
[CAN] Should I 3 Step and Employee or Lay-Off w severance pay?,"Hi all,Small tech business of 20 people. I hired a software developer about 8 months ago. We run a pretty informal ship - I dont care where, when, or even particularly how many hours salaried employees work per week - just the results.Long story the new developer is very pleasant and eager but also isnt as skilled as I need and isnt thriving in our results orientated culture. I am the owner not his direct supervisor. His manager failed at addressing the issues early and he has not had any constructive feedback. I am dealing w manager failure separately but that still leaves me with an employee without the right skills.Now I am looking at the slowing economy and the fact he is both my worst performing staff member as well as the 3rd most expensive (soft dev market is what it is). I would rather save costs and pay a better bonus to my other great staff for Christmas than keep paying him.I normally have a rule that a firing should never be a suprise but this one stumps me. I know we made a bad hire and he just isnt the right person for us. I dont have another position for him either.Is it kinder to just call him in and lay him off with a generous severance (1 month pay for only 7 months w us).Or should i try and put him on a warning period and see if he can try to improve his output. I really dont think he can get his output to where we need it fast enough though."
[CA] how do employers verify work history?,I‚Äôm applying at a big corporation for an admin assistant job. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll run a background check of some sort.

[CA] How screwed am I?,"I think I made a terrible error. All of my experience on my resume (4) says ‚ÄúFull-stack Software Developer‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúFull-stack Software Developer intern‚ÄùBackground:Currently a senior at a college in the US. Finished 4+ rounds of interviews for an entry position at a top-tier company in the US. Got offer and signed. Received a form from Sterling for background check.I was filling out the form for my employment history and opened up my resume for reference. And‚Ä¶ I realized none of my experience had ‚Äúintern‚Äù in job titles.This is the resume I‚Äôve been using for all the applications.I‚Äôve seen from other posts that you should be fine if you clarified they were internships during the interviews. However, I am not sure if I did for all of them. I did clarify, though, for two of them when I had to elaborate on each of them but I think that‚Äôs it. (I was only asked questions for two of the experiences)I honestly don‚Äôt know why I did not put intern for my job title. Maybe I thought it was implicit considering I was in school and those positions were short-termed (4 months for each)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had an intent to deceive any but honestly speaking, everyone could make the claim‚Ä¶. I am extremely anxious that my action can be deemed as a fabrication‚Äîor even at best, conducting unethical resume exaggeration.Thank you all for reading. I‚Äôd like to know what is best for the next steps. I have not submitted the form yet. I am not opposed to contacting my recruiter (or anyone who deals with this) for a quick phone call and telling him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about the unprofessionalism but I just noticed the discrepancy in job titles.‚ÄùEven if they rescind my offer, I don‚Äôt think I would blame them for doing so. From their point of view, I would look like a candidate without integrity.TLDR: I made the terrible mistake of omitting interns for my work experience on my resume, which I used to get an offer from my dream company. Need to submit the form by Sterling for background check and would like to know what to do. Should I just proactively tell them and come clean (at the stake of my offer) or wait for them to call me on the matter after Sterling shares the result?"

"[CAN] I purchased stuff for my work, and will not be reimbursed.","Hello everyone! I work as a pharmaceutical technician up in Canada. Whenever someone at my work retires our store buys them a cake. Two weekends ago we had 3 people retiring, so my boss asked me to run over to the grocery store and buy 3 cakes. I came back and threw the cakes in our fridge and gave my boss the receipt.

[NE] can my boss read my private slack messages in real time?,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but looking for help with a slack question.So my coworkers and I were messaging each other via a private slack channel yesterday and my boss had gone to the restroom. We realized that every time we sent one another a private message on slack, his laptop's notification pinged. We tested this a bunch and there is no way it was a coincidence - each time we sent one, it immediately pinged.From my research, slack doesn't allow workplace admins/owners to view employee messages in real time, they would have to export the messages to read them.I haven't sent anything crazy over slack but I still feel kind of weird if he's reading them and would just like to know.Is it possible he's got some way to read our private messages as we send them? Is there any other explanation for why he'd receive notifications for our private channel? We use company MacBooks if that matters."

Promotion Salary Negotiation [IL],"I am so glad to finally be given a promotion, it is the first one in my 10 year career.

Should I add this?I want to somehow try to accommodate for inflation? How do I mention this to help support the increase. Should I do this?I want to mention salary Market Value and at minimum meet that noting my 10 years of experience and professional degree (masters). Do I share the screenshots I have? Or just write out the range I am seeing? How many sources should I find? I've only seen Glassdoor to show me a reasonable salary to share. PayScale and Robert Half shows a much lower rate.

"[IA] Telecommuting vs. remote, travel to and between office locations, and how these factors impact mileage reimbursement","A small company has all employees sign a Telecommuting Agreement, indicating that the majority of their job functions can be completed at home but they may need to travel to an office for some duties. There are 3 office spaces, one within 10 miles of all of those employees (office #1) and another in a second city (office #2) that's 40-50 miles from each employee's home and 43 miles from the primary office.On occasion an employee may need to travel to office #2 to meet with a client, deliver some updated documents (office #2 holds the printer capable of what is needed), observe construction or equipment, or manage local assets. This might occur once a week per employee.Is there official guidance on when or whether any of this travel constitutes anything besides a typical commute? What if one of the employees typically works in office #1 instead of at home for focus, then needs to go from there to office #2 for a matter - would that require reimbursement? Another employee simply likes to work from office #2, no particular reason why, just to be available near clients if needed. If the vehicle being used is a company owned vehicle and it's a commute, that would constitute personal mileage and have fringe benefit implications as well (which I understand how that works).How might an internal policy be worded differentiating between these cases?"
[MD] What constitutes harassment?,"Hi, apologies in advance for the super long post. I recently got a promotion at my job where I will be overseeing the department that I have been part of for the last four years. Another woman that I work with very much wanted this position as well, but management felt she wasn‚Äôt a right fit (you‚Äôll see why shortly lol).For months now, before I even got the promotion, she‚Äôs been telling our entire team that she‚Äôs going to be extremely upset if I get it over her. She also tries to get them to say bad stuff about me, usually by asking leading questions that start with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you think‚Ä¶?‚Äù Like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you think laceybaghands is unapproachable?‚Äù And ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you think I help you WAY more than laceybaghands?‚ÄùShe then takes these responses and  goes to management and is like, I‚Äôm just concerned because so and so said this this and this about laceybaghands. She basically acts like she‚Äôs doing them a favor, because they‚Äôre too ‚Äúafraid‚Äù to speak up. Just for reference, I‚Äôve never had a problem with anyone on my team, and I actually have a great individual relationship with everyone (hence why I got the promotion lol)She‚Äôs been asked to stop speaking for others by our boss, but then she has a meltdown, telling everyone she‚Äôs been silenced and not allowed to speak her mind.I feel like this is bordering on harassment. I am absolutely sick of the gossip, and I can already feel it affect my ability to do my job. My feeling is that she‚Äôs been trying and will continue to try to turn my team against me, in the hopes that either it‚Äôll make my job harder, or they will revolt and be like NO, WE WANT HER INSTEAD.The thing is 1) She is not yet a direct report to me for the time being. 2) She has not said any of these things in my presence, this is all second hand coming from people on my team and my boss.So I‚Äôm wondering what I should do. Should I have a direct conversation with her first, and then go to HR if it doesn‚Äôt stop? Should I let my boss know I feel harassed? Should I just go straight to HR? I feel like she‚Äôs pretty protected simply because she‚Äôs been at the company for so long, but I‚Äôm just sick of it."

[FL] Question about hours listed on paycheck vs actual hours worked,"Hello all,I am new to this subreddit but hoping someone can help me out or give me some feedback. I have been working at my company for almost 4 years as a full salary employee (was hourly previous to that at a different branch/location).My working hours are M-F 7am-5pm for a total of 10 hours a day or 50 hours week.What I have never understood/always questioned is why my (and everyone else's) paystubs show 86.66 hours worked. We are paid 2x a month, so I understand what is shown is for more than 1 week but what I do not understand is why my managers/bosses insist that everything is based on a 40 hour work week and that ""the hours listed on the paycheck are irrelevant."" Any time this is brought up they simply state that I am a salaried employee so hours worked/hours listed on the paystubs do not matter.For a little added context, in the 4 years I have been at this location I have been promoted 4 times. Each promotion has come with increased salary and a change in working hours (from 12hr days, to 11hr days, now to 10 hour days) yet the ""hours worked"" section of my paystub has always stated 86.66 hours. If accurate my current paystubs should be showing ~110 hours worked per pay period).I am in the wrong for thinking something is not right in this situation? Any feedback/comments would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!"
FMLA Approved for Mental Health - Some questions. [IA],"I was recently approved for FMLA through my therapist for my mental health condition. I wasn‚Äôt able to make any appointments due to my always-changing work schedule, so the FMLA is supposed to help with that. My therapist added a couple mental health days to my FMLA as well. She put my condition down as chronic, so I have intermittent leave.So, I‚Äôve been allotted: 0-3 x per 1 month, 0-4 hours per episode, and 0-1 x per 1 month, 0-2 days per episode, from 8/22/22 to 8/22/23The appointments I take off for in advance, but when a mental health day is needed, it‚Äôs typically a last minute thing. If I take that off, I usually stay home all day and let myself relax so I can return to a better mental state.If I notify my employer in advance for these mental health days (like before my shift), is it possible I could get penalized? Would I need a doctor‚Äôs note when it‚Äôs last minute like that? If I use all of my allotted FMLA per month, does that look bad?It may just be my anxiety spiking, but I really worry about getting penalized in some way, especially because my condition is mental, so it‚Äôs not something my coworkers and supervisor can really ‚Äúsee‚Äù. Am I just being overly paranoid?Also wanted to add - my job is union, not sure if that is important information or not.TIA"
[CA] Terminated while Pregnant,"The funding was cut for the projects I was working on, so my last day is tomorrow (I was informed today). I‚Äôm 33 weeks pregnant and would have gone on maternity leave at 38 weeks. Apparently tomorrow they will offer me some sort of severance since my health insurance was through them (something about offering COBRA). Mailed my last check including PTO accrual overnight, it‚Äôll arrive tomorrow.Is there anything I should do prior to accepting the severance package? Do I qualify for unemployment benefits if I take a severance package? Can I tell them I‚Äôd like to review the offer over the weekend or must I sign when it‚Äôs given to me?I‚Äôm terrified."
Is it okay to change my professional title before get the job? [INDO],"Hi, I'm currently a college student, but I have work experience as IT Specialist/Support before. I put my professional title as it is in my resume, not so recently I want to become a Data Analyst/Data Engineer whilst doing some project of it to put it in my resume.If I change my title into Data Analyst/Data Engineer but have no experience with that, is it okay? Or stay with it (IT Specialist/Support) and change it after landing a job that I want?Thanks!"
[CA] Job posted externally but not internally,"I saw a job posting for a position im interested in at my company on LinkedIn and checked if I could apply internally. Turns out, it‚Äôs not posted internally. I searched with the requisition ID and everything. Could there but a reason for this? Also, should I talk to my manager telling him I wish to apply, or should I just apply externally?"
[CA] Can I ignore a text about a semi-work-related matter from a coworker I used to date?,"I dated a guy at work (I know, bad move) for a month. It ended badly, but we remained civil at work. After a time, he tried to be friends with me and hang around my office and ask if I wanted to hang out, but I made it clear I was not interested.We are in two different departments, but the work tends to overlap. Today, I was working from home and he sent me a text asking me to help out a family member with an issue that my department deals with. There is nothing inherently unethical about the request in my line of work. However, I don‚Äôt want to answer the text because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable corresponding with my ex out of work about personal matters, and I‚Äôd prefer not to get involved in his family stuff even if the family member could potentially be a ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù of my company (sorry to be vague about the nature of the business but I am trying to keep things as anonymous as possible). HR managers ‚Äî is it wrong to ignore this text? Or should I politely tell him I would prefer not to get involved? TIA!"
Microsoft Hiring Event [IL],"I participated in an hiring event at Microsoft and I thought the conversations went really well minus a technical question, but I showed a thirst for knowledge on that one. The very next day I received an email from the recruiter saying ‚ÄúThe candidate review team was quite impressed with your background and experience. However, at this time, the team has decided to move forward with other candidates who are strategically aligned to the role, but don't let this be the end of your exploration of careers at Microsoft!"" The recruiter initially told me that I can interview and be considered for more than just the role I applied for. Does this mean I am still being considered for other roles or is it just straight no?"
[OH] lied to a recruiter and got the position,"I will be monitoring this heavily for any replies so please ask any questions and I will provide as much detail as possible.I am in the US, specifically in Ohio. I have been interviewing for a bit with a recruiter. This recruiter works at a independent firm that works with employers to find good employees. He gets a percent of my negotiated salary from the employer when I start. So no money comes from me.Let me add context about me and my position, I am an engineer and young for my position but am very bright and good at what I do. Everyone I interview with also gets this impression and is very impressed with me. However I have no formal education and am entirely self taught. This was made clear to everyone involved. My current employer took a shot with me in my position and was very happy with himself since he had me hired at a low rate doing pretty sophisticated work. I knew that I was getting a bit of the butt end of stick compensation wise - however since I am without schooling I thought it would be good to work here and it was fair. I have worked there for the past 4 years.Originally my current employer told me that Engineers make 60k a year here. However this was a lie and all of our engineers make below that and are remote. When negotiating I argued for 50k as I thought that it was fair. They accepted and I've been on that salary for over 3 years. (Starting there I made less).When talking with the recruiter I lied about my current salary and said that I make 67K and do some other work that will edge my total income out to close to 75K. I did not think much of it at the time.I thought it was a good time to look for what was available for me now since I have some experience under my resume. The recruiter was able to find me two positions recently that he thought I'd be a good fit for. I did an interview with each and they both really liked me, the first one I will refer to as Company A, said I would hear back by the end of the week. Company B also very much liked me and wanted me back for a second round interview with their team. Company B had a person from their team need to take vacation time so they postponed my interview out another week.Talking with the recruiter he had said it would be a good idea to use the interview with Company B to get Company A to give an offer that you wont refuse and asked me for a number. I said 100K. The recruiter said that Company A really loved me and accepted the 100K for me not to do the other interview with Company B. The recruiter reached out and told Company B I was given an offer.The next day I learned they accepted they sent me an official offer for 100K. The offer itself just went over what benefits they offered the 100K salary and the start date. Plus some formal language about being happy to have me work for them. Nothing in the offer had anything about contingencies. There line about attached Employee benefits but none were attached. On face value everything looked good here. Knowing they were excited to have me and that they were more than willing to give me the 100K I was excited. I signed the offer of employment and returned it to them.After I signed the offer, I let my current employer know I accepted another position and am putting in my two weeks. My boss was super cool about it and was glad to see me doing well.Today I got some documents asking for employment history and starting salary and ending salary. I have no idea what the recruiter may have said to Company A about my current salary. I am worried that the recruiter mentioned my ""75K"" current salary I lied about and Company A thinks that is what I am making. I have no intention of lying in writing about my current salary and will provide them with only factual information. I have never communicated with Company A my current salary. My fear is that learning my current salary may affect how they feel about having me work for 100K as I am doubling my salary."
[CA] Spent the last 2 years being self-employed and now its hurting me in a background check,"I'm looking for some advice, and please don't rip me apart too hard I'm really stressed.I have a 12 month contract offer at a large investment firm, and I despererly need this job. I put down self-employed for some of 2020 and all of 2021. When in reality I was working under the table for my in laws. I was barely working, still figuring some stuff out, didn't earn a lot, and worked very inconsistently.Fast forward to today and I am supposed to start this new job on the 24th. I'm really excited for it. This is really going to turn my life around. I get an email today asking for either 1099's or Schedule C's in order to verify my employment.for 2020 I filed taxes, but did not include the $900 I made working for my in laws. and in 2021 I probably made under $20k (barely working I was really depressed at the time). Never filed taxes for 2021.What are my options here. How do I make this right.I think I'm gonna have to file a modification to my 2020 taxes, with a Schedule C and then pay the amount owed. And I'm thinking about filing taxes for 2021 now, but I'm not sure what they are looking for in my background check. Could I get away with just filling out a Schedule C. I'm thinking they are able to crossreference with the IRS database.I don't mind filing my taxes. really not trying to avoid them, I'm just coming from desperation here, and I don't know the way forward"
Will I get my pay back ? [TX] [IN],"Hello guys, I moved from Indiana to texas last week to join a job and forgot to change my address in my W-4 and other forms. I received my pay today but was taxed state tax as an Indiana resident even though I lived in texas and rented a house.

[TX][NY] - Company Forgot to Adjust Comp,"I joined my current company around a year ago remotely in TX, but my team is located in NY, NY. My starting comp was for the NY area and it was never adjusted for the TX cost of living.

[CA] How do we term for lack of fit?,"We hired a 20 year old to work in our sort of ‚Äúgift shop‚Äù part of our building 2 weeks ago. He didn‚Äôt really have a ton of experience, but we were desperate for someone. He lacks a lot of social awareness and he works the cash register where he has to interact with our guests. He plays loud Chinese music off his phone (he just moved from China) when we already have music playing in the store, he burps loudly mid sentence when talking to people, and he admitted to his boss that he can‚Äôt commit to the FT schedule since he‚Äôs applied to work for another place and he‚Äôs hoping to go in for an interview.I‚Äôm asking his manager to review him in 2 weeks once he hits his 30 day mark and establish he‚Äôs not picking up on appropriate work behavior.

[UK] How can I improve delegation & set clear objectives while balancing the unexpected very heavy workload?,"About 10 weeks in a new HR role and having a hard time balancing the amount of projects and setting clear vision for the team I manage. During interview stages, company didn‚Äôt seem as disorganised as it actually is; fair enough we all have spiders in our closet. How can I improve delegation & set clear objectives while balancing the unexpected very heavy workload? Any tips appreciated. Up for the challenge, but feel as if I‚Äôm not able to produce my best work due to volume. Additionally, where to draw the line for advocating for what employees truly want vs sucking it up and producing what leadership wants? Previously, I‚Äôd spec out frameworks for improvements on down time. No down time at all; need to deliver on my duties & projects assigned to me. I remind myself daily ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a job, do your work and let it go‚Äù.  And no, I cannot ask for more resources - I do know I need to get more out of my team, they are very junior. Need to coach more, but constantly pull the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it done‚Äù to hit deadlines. Understand I am failing them and myself - need some help!"
[GA]Just received an offer from a company but still in the interviewing process for a different company,"So I just received an offer from a company (let‚Äôs say Company A) but I am still interviewing at a different company (Company B) that I would much rather work for. The interviewer for Company B stated that the process will likely take about 2 more weeks before a decision is made.I know when receiving an offer, candidates typically have 3 days to make a decision and you can typically ask for an extension but is two weeks too long?The role that I received an offer for at company A is not a role that I‚Äôm super passionate about compared to the role at company B, where I am still interviewing.Any advice on how to approach this situation? I know if I reject the offer at company A and wait to see if I receive an offer at the preferred role at company B, there is a chance that I don‚Äôt receive an offer from company B and then I‚Äôm left with no options."
Got a verbal offer (with no details) but asked to attend HR presentation tomorrow to learn the actual salary and benefits. What to expect? [NC],"I got a call from the hiring manager just confirming that I'm getting an offer but that their standard practice is to have us attend an HR zoom presentation (~45 minutes) where they share the salary and go over all the benefits in detail.I haven't experienced this process before and I'm not really a fan of having to emotionally/logistically process these huge pieces of information during a prolonged meeting, but whatever.Can anyone tell me what to expect?

[TN] Use of psychometric assessments for employees reapplying on their current jobs,Our organization is going through a reorg Some jobs will be cut and some job descriptions are being rewritten. Current employees will be reapplying on their current jobs. Korn Ferry psychometric assessments are being considered as part of that reapplication process. Is this normal? I assumed that those assessments could be used for new hires but am not sure why they are being discussed in the case where a current employee is reapplying on their own job. Is this normal practice? I feel that this could lead to grievances and discrimination complaints.
[PA] Did I get the job?,"Hey all, I came here for some insight since this interview had me stressed!So I did a phone interview with this company, I was invited back for an in person interview. The in person went really well and they gave me a specific timeline of when to know (by the end of the week). After that they invited me to a team shadow, I was there for 3 hours speaking to all of the managers in 30 minute segments, I thought it went great with conversations flowing naturally and everyone seemed to love me. Some even saying they thought I‚Äôd fit the position very well.The only thing that has me worried was the manager at the end, she didn‚Äôt give me a specific timeline to hear back, just said that they‚Äôre still ‚Äúworking through the hiring cycle‚Äù. Also saying they have more interviews to do. She said the same thing in her reply to my follow up thank you email.Do you think I got the job? And how many other people do you think they‚Äôre bringing in for the shadow? It seems very time consuming, and they‚Äôre only in office two days a week so I imagine it can‚Äôt be many? Thanks In advance!"
Credit Report / Background Check Question [NY],"Hello HR people. Quick question for anyone in the know:Got a job offer from a fintech company that does a credit report background check and they say that includes job and education verification. Got the offer Tuesday and they said I had to complete the signature to proceed with background check by Wednesday or it could delay my first day which would be next week.There is one job on my resume that definitely will not show up on the credit report. I do however know the owner of that company and he will verify should they ask. They shipped me the equipment for the job today, two days after I completed the info for the background check. They also mentioned it would take about a month for the check to be complete. My question is: is the month long part for the criminal check component, if they saw an issue with job verification would they have said something already prior to shipping the equipment? Should I be worried?Any insight is appreciated - I'm losing sleep over this!"

[CA] is HR protecting my toxic boss?,"This is going to be long, TIA.My boss is a known bully to everyone on the HR team. We are in TA, so we coordinate with HR often.He is openly rude to team members during HR meetings, he‚Äôs been openly rude to an individual during a marketing meeting, and it had gotten to a point a couple months ago where he was completely icing out and ‚Äúquiet firing‚Äù my teammate for no apparent reason. He would call me multiple times a day every day (I wfh) for 10-30 minutes at a time just to talk AT me and complain about this employee, and the fact that they had asked for a raise. He shared details from conversations that should‚Äôve remained private, and just bad-mouthed every single person on our small team and even shared his negative thoughts of the Executive team and other hiring managers.He‚Äôs referred to the LGBTQ+ community as random letters and numbers multiple times because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just too much for him to remember‚Äù, he‚Äôs called a new hire r*tarded, he‚Äôs anti-BLM, fat-phobic, and the list just goes on and on of how inappropriate he is.After getting fed up and deciding to ask other coworkers if they had this experience, I‚Äôve found that he‚Äôs called other people multiple times a day just to talk at them and gossip to two other people at various times throughout his time at this company.I reported all of his behavior to the VP of HR with audio recording of the gossip and fat-phobic examples and had a coworker corroborate these same behaviors during his exit interview the same week. They claimed an investigation was done, yet nothing changed except he stopped calling me multiple times a day. In fact, he has stopped communicating and meeting with me 1:1 pretty much all together the past 2-3 months. I think he is ‚Äúquiet firing‚Äù me the same way he did to my old teammate. This feels like retaliation, and I also feel like HR is protecting someone they shouldnt.There are so many more details I could share about his inappropriate behavior if you need context but I just feel unsure about it all and would love a professionals opinion?"
[MA] Help not getting forgotten by recruiter?,"Hi all! (TLDR at bottom)I applied for a state trainee position. Nowhere on the application did it list a target start date but I'd read online that it was late May. I also used glassdoor and read similar training positions took a few weeks from interview to hire.I was excited when I got the interview and it went really well and the recruiter told me righr off the bat that she was excited to push me through to the program directors. And she said if I get any offers to let her know because she can try to push the process along.Well, I did and I told her. So after meeting with the directors, they all agreed to push me along through panel interviews with execs. It went well. My interviews all lasted longer than the set time and they all seemed to like me.Cool. I did and found out that they usually don't give out decisions until Dec/Jan and this is too early for execs and they wanted people to compare me to.I asked to keep me in consideration even if they couldn't give an answer now. Recruiter said of course. But im worries as they go through the hiring, I'll be forgotten.Any tips/ways to continually reach out during the next 2 months? I went through the entire planned hiring process already.TLDR: I sped through hiring process but decisions don't get made for months. Since I'm done with interviews, how do I keep in touch with recruiter/hiring team without annoying them?"
[NC] Questions about time off due to caring commitments,"Hi all!I took some time out of the workforce due to caring commitments for a family member, and I was wondering a few things regarding future employment interviews/onboarding.How much detail will I be expected to go into about personal circumstances during my interview?What is HR allowed to ask about these caring commitments?Will they require me to provide any sort of proof/checks that I was a caretaker for a family member?Thank you very much for your advice and guidance!"
[VA] Rules on working a Full & Part Time Job,"Hello,  I recently learned about an opportunity to earn some extra income, working part time through my local county‚Äôs parks and recreation department.I‚Äôm wondering if my employer can legally stop me from working the part time opportunity on my days off?This opportunity is not a typical part time job as it doesn‚Äôt have a set schedule, and I‚Äôd be able to work whatever days I want, while still being able to work overtime at my regular job should the need arise.Would this type of opportunity likely be an issue with an employer or would they probably be cool with it?"
"[MA] job based on background check, date wrong on resume [MA]",So I got a job offer that I'm thrilled about based on a background check.I put on my resume a wrong date for a job so I was like off by a year because I'm dyslexic and ADHD and especially with numbers. No real excuse:(.It would have looked weird if they noticed it at the interview cuz it overlaps with another full-time job. I was basically never asked about it.I contacted them as soon as I saw it and said there was an error. HR didn't seem to concerned but said she would ask. I also put it into orange tree correctly. (More than a week ago)Now today I got a welcome letter to start on the 10th and my boss (possibly) added me on LinkedIn.Should I be worried? I am so thrilled about this job.
[OK] to [FL] travel surprise,"I have a question about how to address something with my HR administrator.Work in [OK] was sent to [FL]to help with storms.  I was instructed to make my flight and car reservations but they would handle the lodging. I figured they must have a better deal than I can get, so I don‚Äôt worry about it. Got info about my room, flew down, checked into my hotel, decided to go get some sunshine after a day of travel.Then my HR admin calls me and asks ‚ÄúHow many beds are in your room?‚Äù I say two, they say ‚Äúgreat, another rep will be staying with you.‚ÄùNow I knew they had reservations for two rooms because another rep that is female was gonna be working with me.  But she couldn‚Äôt come at the last minute. So the got a male rep from her office as a replacement.I‚Äôve had zoom calls with this male rep but we had never met in person. So he is a stranger.I laughed and got on the elevator to go downstairs and rep 2 was waiting at the elevator door when they open.We both express frustration with the way it was handled. We understand the cost savings and we both had been in dorm style living before. So it‚Äôs an annoyance not a huge deal.We‚Äôre here for eight more days."
[NY] How would you as an HR person view a resume with a previous position at a special needs consulting firm,"This is a difficult question to put in a short title. Basically, I'm curious about a company (Auticon) that specifically employs people on the spectrum. I've got Asperger's.Me being me, I'm thinking two steps ahead and I'm thinking ""gee, what if I don't like that job either; will working at Auticon have a negative impact on my next job?"" I feel like by taking a job there, which, yeah it seems ""okay,"" but it's just another job, nothing stands out other than that they cater to (or take advantage of, depending on how you look at it) people on the spectrum. I could still hate it and want to leave (interviews are honestly useless in my opinion), the company could fail, etc.Having said that, suppose I leave a company like that and go to work somewhere (anywhere) else, how would the fact that I worked at a company like that previously affect your hiring decision? Would it set off any red flags? I feel like I'd be painting a big target on my back for the next job.Thanks"

[NY] How to decrease NO SHOW rate of first interviews?,I am a manager for a small medical office. I find that I could schedule 10 interviews for a given day and only about 2-3 people would actually show up.Is this normal? Or is there some room for improvement?The two positions that I am looking to fill are front desk receptionist and a medical assistant.I post the job openings on indeed and then call/text each candidate that I am interested in. I realized that people don't really read the job descriptions so I would often waste time with pointless interviews.To mediate this I started doing during the first call is ask them a couple of questions.Are you okay with the posted salary range?Are you okay with commuting to our location?Do you speak Spanish and able to translate to and from?Are you okay with the times we are open?I also tell them briefly about the clinic and the daily duties.After which I give the applicant the opportunity to ask any questions they might have.If they answered YES to all of the above questions I ask if they would be interested to coming for an interview. Interview would get scheduled.
[TX] Is it discriminatory for an employer to require some workers to return to office but allow other workers in the same role to continue to work remotely?,"Like many businesses, my employer adopted a work remote policy at the start of the pandemic. Recently, the company has announced that a return to office policy will soon be implemented.For context, my company is an IT company based in Texas, approximately 500 employees, and there is nobody in our organization that does not work off of a laptop, regardless if they are on site or remote. It is also worth mentioning that the mandatory return to office policy has not been designed to address any sort of performance or efficiency issues.QUESTION: If there are 100 employees that have exactly the same job function and job title, 70 of which are local but 30 of which live More than 200 mi away from the office, from an HR perspective is it legal to require the 70 local employees to come into the office but continue to allow the 30 remote employees to continue working remotely from home?Thank you very much for your time?"
[CO] Rescinding Acceptance for Federal W2 Contract Role with Clearance?,"I initially accepted a W2 Contract Role that had me start public trust clearance process.

[NY] What are some reasons an interviewer ghosts you after positive interviews?,"[NY] I had a great first interview, about 45 mins. by Zoom. The manager said she could saw where she‚Äôd like to fit me in the team she‚Äôs building. The second interview was about 30 minutes with the company‚Äôs co-owner in Milan. Again, the conversation was good, and I had the impression they were very interested in me.    That was a week ago. Since then complete silence, no answer to 3 emails (the thank you, then a quick update of reference‚Äôs email address, and one this morning letting them know I am still very interested in the position.) No one has contacted my references.   Is it safe to assume they don‚Äôt want to move forward with me? What could be some reasons for this?    I have bad credit as a result of long medical treatment that made me unable to work. Could that be it?   I had a brief  part-time job this year that ended disastrously. The store closed and I didn‚Äôt include it on my resume. I used the other store I worked part-time for during that period. Could that be it?   I‚Äôm discouraged because, like a lot of people, I‚Äôve applied for over 100 jobs and this was the most promising.   I can‚Äôt change those 2 bad marks against me in the past. What should I do in the future? I didn‚Äôt lie about anything, I just didn‚Äôt mention it.   What are other reasons a hiring manager would ghost someone?   Thanks. I‚Äôm trying not to let this get me down, but job searched can really mess with your confidence and hope."
Want to wait until my drug test and background check come back ok before giving my two week notice. [OH],Let‚Äôs suppose I receive a job offer that is contingent upon successful completion of a drug test and background check.  I‚Äôd like to wait until the results of both come back as ‚Äúsuccessfully passed‚Äù before giving my two week notice to my current employer.  What‚Äôs the best way to word this to the HR rep without throwing up a red flag like I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll fail the drug test? FYI the thing I‚Äôm worried about is that I was terminated for misconduct at my previous job and they might find out (current job didn‚Äôt find out though).
[MO] Recruiter asks for immigration documents upon hire and interview with hiring manager,"Hi there, I was reached out by recruiter from a fortune 500 pharmaceutical company. Soon after our conversation, she sent an email asking about my work permit‚Äôs details like category and expiration date (I‚Äôm currently holding work permit from marrying US citizen - waiting for green card interview). She said she needed to check with HR to see if I‚Äôm ‚Äúeligible‚Äù. This gives me a feeling that they are picking candidates based on their status, of which the job description never specifies that.My question is, do I have to provide those information upon hire with the company? I just feel odd for being asked by a recruiter but not by HR, or this is just a normal practice that I‚Äôm not aware of?"
[CA] Confidentiality around unemployment for reduced hours,I just filed for Unemployment for reduced hours as my hours have went from 20-35 hours a week to 10-15 a week due to a slow season of business. I have picked up a second job but not making very much there either. I am curious whether it is legal for my employer to tell any other employees that I filed for unemployment as I am a little embarrassed that I needed to file for it but struggling to make ends meet right now and felt like it was my last option until I find a job that can give me more hours. My place of employment is very unprofessional and I am just anxious whether anyone will make fun of me for applying if they find out
[MO] 6mo Unpaid Travel.. can HR help me?,"So I started at my job June 2021, and in October they asked me to start covering for a part-timer who was in the hospital at a location 25 minutes from me (my typical drive is like 8). I was told by our district manager at the time I‚Äôd be compensated, and over the next two months I received ~$200/mo for working every Saturday and some wednesdays. So now it‚Äôs January, and said district manager leaves, followed by the manager of the 2nd location, the territory manager, and the part-timer. In all this chaos there was never some one available to send my mileage to. We changed hands every few months and honestly I was juggling work and school and couldn‚Äôt keep track of who or where or when.

So, now we‚Äôve been under direction of our current territory manager for some time, and it‚Äôs official it will be that way for some time, so I went through all of my texts and pictures and any date I had evidence for I compiled. I wrote out the list and gave it to my manager who said she‚Äôd pass it on, and eventually I get a call from the territory manager.

TLDR In short she said that due to the changing of hands, I‚Äôll only be reimbursed from July of this year onwards. Those 4 months amounted to $90 which didn‚Äôt seem right considering what I was paid last year. And those 4/10 months are nothing-the majority of my coverage and drive time there was in the first 6mo this year when she wasn‚Äôt here and there was no one to really report to. Something about this just doesn‚Äôt seem right- and I don‚Äôt know if HR would be the right call for something like this, or if I should just be happy with what I got. The associate handbook for travel time is as follows;

‚Äú‚ÄùTRAVEL TIME AND MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT ____ pays both travel time and mileage expense to Associates who have been requested by appropriate supervisory personnel to provide temporary coverage at a store other than where they are normally scheduled to work. The rules and method to record and submit authorized travel time and mileage expense for payment are as follows: Travel time will be recorded and paid through Payroll ON THE TIME SHEET OF THE LOCATION TO WHICH YOU ARE TEMPORARILY ASSIGNED and must be entered as a Time Clock Edit. If commuting from home to the temporarily assigned store, travel time in excess of commute time from home to base store will be paid. If asked to change locations during a regular shift, travel time between locations will be paid. Mileage expense for approved travel will be paid at the company's standard reimbursement rate per mile that is in effect at the time of travel (check with District Manager to confirm rate, if necessary)."
[PA] FMLA Eligibility after break in employment,"Hi, two part question.

So, I worked for my employer for 2 years, and left for 2 years, and returned to the same position 11 months ago. I also found out I was pregnant within weeks of returning, with a due date before I would have worked 1250 hours. I was therefore not eligible for FMLA or maternity leave, and I had to take all my PTO, returning in only a few weeks - way before I was physically ready but unable to negotiate more time off.

Q1: Now that I've returned, and now that I've hit the 1250 hour mark, am I eligible for FMLA again? Based on the DOL website, that's what it feels like it should be, however my HR says no because I don't have 12 consecutive months. It's a non-issue really since my anniversary of hire is in November, but if they're not interpreting the law correctly I'd like to point it out (tactfully of course) because they may not be complying with others.

Anywho, Q2: am I interpreting the things correctly that even though the baby was born in June, once I am eligible for FMLA I am able to take up to 12 weeks for bonding as long as it is completed before the baby turns 1?




Edited: Clarifying, I was not able to take FMLA after childbirth due to not meeting eligibility requirements, I used all my PTO. I was rehired last November, gave birth in June, returned in August, met the hourly eligibility in September and technically have a total of 12 months, and wonder if I can go on FMLA leave now even though bebe is 3 months old."

[IL] Request to correct disclosure,"I called Benefits before retiring. They gave me the answer but failed to inform it would change the next month upon CBA expiration. Upon retirement we have no union association, so I never dreamed the contract expiration would affect the terms of my retirement.

It was a simple question, did they still provide retiree health insurance? Answer: ‚ÄúYes they did, the same plan I retired under, no cost but now with a lifetime accumulation.‚Äù They omitted it would soon change with a costly premium schedule. Then change back, with the new contract.

Doesn‚Äôt ERISA require questions to be answered truthfully? They were aware of the circumstances - contemplating retirement. What if retirees insurance was being discontinued? The following month?

HR has corrected other retirees missteps, I found a letter of agreement where they extended the enrollment due to confusion. The DOL feels they should rectify and the process is exhausting. The conference calls are upsetting, HR is furious. DOL suggests I contact HR director or Vice-President??

Thoughts?"
"[TX] I want to give notice for a period where I already am taking PTO for a family wedding, but PTO can‚Äôt be taken during your 2wks at my company","I hope to be able to put 2wks in Friday. This job has been pretty toxic and I need out. I‚Äôm waiting for everything to be official with the new job before giving notice, but I do want to give a real notice.

My sister‚Äôs wedding is coming up. I have PTO from next Wed to the following Mon that has been approved. This has been established time off for me for months. However, in our handbook, no paid leave can be taken during your notice period. The CEO does have the discretion to waive the notice period though

Honestly it‚Äôs really important to me to get paid for these days if at all possible. I will lose around 10hr of PTO if I do go to wedding and then give less than 2wks notice as they only pay out if you give a full 2wks. That‚Äôs fine, but I don‚Äôt want to essentially lose all of the time.

I could also give a full notice on the last day of my pto and work those 2 weeks but it would leave no time before starting the new position and I do need a mental health reset if possible.

I‚Äôm not really sure how to proceed. Should I be fully transparent with HR once I‚Äôm ready to put in notice and explain the situation? I am happy to work the days on either side of the planned PTO. I do want to give notice and not fuck people over.

But obviously attending the wedding is non negotiable. I‚Äôll just quit and take it unpaid if needed but financially with the increased health insurance expenses and wedding expenses and all of that, having those days paid would help. Could they refuse to pay the PTO if I quit with a short notice after the wedding?

I want a relatively happy solution for everyone but I‚Äôm lost here"
[MN] Inaccurate Employment Verification,"I received a copy of my pre-employment background check. Under the employment verification, I saw that a past employer from about 15 years ago said ‚Äúno record found‚Äù instead of confirming.

"[MA] Got let go after I purchased flights with my personal card, employer asking for the refund","I purchased flights for a conference on my personal card and expensed them at the instruction of my employer, several weeks later I was let go. The company has now requested I send the full amount in the form of a check back to HQ. I was able to get a proper refund of $60 on the baggage fees, which I intend to return to the company. But the cost of the flight tickets was non-refundable, and I was only allowed to cancel the flight for travel credits.

My question to the community is, what‚Äôs the correct way to proceed here? Can the company realistically force me to send a check for the full amount even though the only refund available to me for the cost of the tickets was travel credits (that I have no use for)?

Thank you in advance."
[WI] Is my employer violating something here knowing my workplace accommodation?,"I seeked a few workplace reasonable accommodations months ago. I have migraines that make it hard for me to work longer than 8 hours. I have been at my company now for many years and recently have been getting horrible migraine flare ups. Yes, I have tried preventative and also abortive, they hardly do anything. I sometimes have to go to urgent care or the ER to get meds and IVs pumped into me because I cannot stop throwing up with a bad migraine. I used to work voluntary overtime all the time years ago at my current company and simply cannot anymore like I used to. Likewise, if I travel too long (passenger or driver it does not matter) then I get a migraine.

Months ago I sent a request to central headquarters about this all and they sent me some paperwork to fill out on official government forms. It should be noted that the industry I work in does say overtime is required to work the job, it says that right on the application in fact. However, there are always going to be people who get hurt at or outside of work who then are placed on ""light duty"" and are then given light duty work where there is no overtime. My request for the 8 hour work restriction was approved, but many people at my workplace do not understand this and it has caused some division. Our overtime for the next shift if we are short is mandated by an ordering system where say I should be getting forced to stay I am not since I have the 8 hour work accommodation through my headquarters. Is this legit though? What about what the job application and position description says where it says ""must be able to work overtime?"" Would I not be in violation with this with this approved accommodation?

This is not even the worst of it all. Our work site is near my home. However another work site over 200 miles away is very short staffed. That work site is so short staffed that central headquarters has been mandating work sites around the entire state to send a few staff each pay period to that desperately needed worksite (the worksite requiring people to help is about 50% vacant for staff). 2 staff where I work are being sent every pay period. A lit of who is going is made and you know months in advance. My boss who controls that list of people going knows I have the travel restriction and that it was approved. He put my name on the list anyway for December. My 50 mile travel restriction is ending in February 2023. So would this not be a violation of what central headquarters said?

Here is the thing: I would probably volunteer if I did not have this migraine stuff going on. I like doing what I do. But I CANNOT do it. I cannot travel 200 miles and do this. It would guarantee cause a migraine and then I would have to miss days of work. So a few weeks ago my response from central headquarters comes and they not only agree to me having an 8 hour work restriction but they likewise agree word for word ""Limit travel to 50 mi radius from work site-approved through February 28, 2023.""

My boss recently put me on a list of staff to go to this other worksite 200 miles away knowing what central headquarters HR had said regarding the travel restriction. I cannot believe it. Can they do this? My neurologist, myself and central headquarters HR are all on the same page in my opinion, for some reason my boss still thinks he can tell me I have to go. How should I address all this? Please give insights into this. Is this a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act? Please help."
[IN] FMLA - Not Returning,"I will be using 2 months of FMLA here soon and while I'm out I am planning on looking for another job.

The FMLA paperwork says that I might be liable for reimbursing the company for their share of health insurance premiums paid on my behalf if I don't return to work.

If I return, and immediately put in my 2 weeks notice, is this sufficient to avoid having to repay those premiums or is there a specific time period I would have to stay?"
"[FL] Leaving job, need to switch my family to my wife's insurance, company won't give me a loss of coverage letter.","I'm leaving my job to run my business full time, my family will be moving to the health insurance offered by my wife's job but since we're outside of enrollment we would need to prove we're having a qualifying event.

HR at my job sent me a generic leaving packet via email that doesn't have my name on it anywhere, and on insurance they sent me a PDF that outlines how much COBRA would cost and says ""current coverage ends by the end of the month following your termination"".

I emailed HR, explained my situation and asked for a loss of coverage letter and they kept pointing back to the generic PDF.

I pressed further and they said they would ""check to see if this is something we have"" and then subsequently responded that they ""don't have this form"".

Any suggestions on how to move forward with this? We obviously want to get this resolved as quickly as possible so there is no gap in coverage."
[MA] Staying in touch during long hiring process?,"Basically, I got fast-tracked through this interview process because the recruiter and program leads for a state advanced trainee program really liked me and I told them I had multiple job offers.

So, they sped me through three panel interviews with execs and said they'd have a final decision by Monday (yesterday). Well, the program starts in May and the final decisions typically go out in January, so the execs said they didnt feel comfortable giving a final decision because they usually don't until then and its too early but they liked me well enough. The recruiter apologized and I said I still would like to be considered (its a way better job than any of the others) and they said they'd definitely keep me in the candidate pool.

Its a long way until January and I dont want to be forgotten. Initially, I'd heard on glassdoor that the program started in January (doesnt say on gov website) so I didn't think fast tracking was that big of a deal but now I'm thinking I'll be forgotten if I dont do something to stay in touch.

How are some ways to reach out and stay competitive in their candidate pool (and when to do it)?"
[CA] Small business closing after 50 years. How to help loyal employees?,"I‚Äôm a HR-department-of-one, among other jobs, for my family‚Äôs small business that has lasted for over 50 years. This is the only HR job I‚Äôve had.

We have many very loyal employees who have worked for us for 10-20 years. However, we can‚Äôt continue to run it and will be selling it. We predict the new owners might keep some employees on for awhile, but there are no guarantees.

I have a legal background and understand the laws already (WARN, COBRA, unemployment, etc.), but I don‚Äôt have much experience with the human side of HR or with hiring. What can we do now to help prepare the employees for a new job?

Also, when should we tell them? I know it will effect morale and a few might even jump-ship, but they should have enough warning.

(I understand usually employees are supposed to post questions, but I‚Äôm hoping an experienced HR manager has some tips for this inexperienced one.)"
[INDIA] Hiring spree before an acquisition. Why?,"My current employer went on a massive hiring spree adding atleast 100 people in few months. I'd just joined the team last month and noticed most employees were quiet quitters and unenthusiastic. I was a red flag but i ignored that and continued with my work. Currently one month after I'd joined the company, the CEO sends an email about being acquired by a public company. He says that there won't be any changes in payrolls or designation but the HR says later we'd consolidate. The acquiring company is a digital transformation company so it most likely won't reduce headcount in engineering teams.

I work as a writer in the marketing team. Should I start looking for another job? Why would they hire me if they plan on merging? And is 2 months into a new workplace to early to leave?"
